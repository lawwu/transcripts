[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:45.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance is Friday and like any good Friday, that means Q&A.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.880]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   My name is Joshua.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600]   I am your host and this is Friday, which means a live call-in show.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   I take a combination of calls.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.880]   Sometimes I take written questions.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.840]   I'm hoping we have some time today to get some written questions and these calls are
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.520]   open to patrons of the show, people who support the show on Patreon.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520]   Never know what they are.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.840]   It's kind of like live radio, but here we go.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.960]   If you would like to gain access to one of these shows, sign up to support the show on
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   Patreon.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   Go to Patreon.com/RadicalPersonalFinance.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   Patreon.com/RadicalPersonalFinance.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.120]   I do that just in order to help meter out the call volume a little bit.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.160]   Every now and then you never know.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   If you sign up and follow me in some of the other fun places, if you're on the email list,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.640]   then that's a good thing to do.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.560]   Then sometimes every now and then I'll send out an email and say, "Hey, I'm doing a live
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   Q&A."
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.400]   If you're in the Facebook group, then sometimes I pop an announcement in there, "I'm doing
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   a live Q&A."
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   If you're following me in some of those formats, follow me on Twitter @JoshuaSheets or on Facebook
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.440]   in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group or on the page.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.160]   I'll often post announcements there.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.360]   Again, email list, et cetera.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.320]   Those are a few different ways for you to get involved.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.280]   Sometimes I will do a Q&A for people who are following me there.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.160]   But each and every Friday, the most reliable way to get on a Q&A show is to join on Patreon.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.640]   Go to Patreon.com/RadicalPersonalFinance and sign up there.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.560]   If you'd like to get on the email list, the best way to do that at the moment is to go
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.480]   to RadicalBooklist.com.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.000]   If you go to RadicalBooklist.com, I will send you my recommended reading list for financial
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   freedom, 12 books.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   I've had some great feedback just from that list alone.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.080]   Several listeners have written to me and said that some of my book recommendations there
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.160]   have, and this is not hyperbole, have changed their life, have helped them in some really
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.140]   meaningful ways.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.140]   That's another thing you can do.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.840]   I encourage you to go to RadicalBooklist.com.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.400]   Sign up there for the book reading list.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.160]   You'll get a series of emails with explanations on each of the books that I recommend that
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   you read.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.080]   It's just a start to start you on your financial freedom education.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.480]   But there are 12 books on that list.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.560]   If you begin with those 12 books, I can promise you that your 2020 will be starting off on
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.720]   a very different foot.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.040]   12 books there, one book a month, that was a really good habit for you to set.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.520]   I believe that all 12 of those books will serve you well.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.800]   I've thought carefully about the order that I even present them to you.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.600]   I begin with books that most people wouldn't recommend on a personal finance reading list,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   but that you will really want as you think about your 2020 goals and even consider this
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   next decade.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.280]   Now let's go to the phone to begin with Anne in Maryland.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.600]   Anne, welcome to the Q&A show.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   How can I serve you today?
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   Anne Reitman Hi, Joshua.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.720]   First of all, I want to say that I really love the lyrics of the song for this conference
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   call.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   I really want to dial again.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   J.P.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.280]   Boyd Yes, and just because the audience doesn't
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.000]   get a chance to hear that, only you heard it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.120]   When people call in, there's a funny song when you're waiting on hold for me to show
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.080]   up and start the conference call for the live Q&A.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.800]   And so it is very funny.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.920]   But I'll tell you what, if you want to do that, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.440]   sign up and join me on the next call, and then you can hear the lyrics that Anne is
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   alluding to.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440]   Anne Reitman Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   I love listening to it.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   That's why I call so frequently.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:25.240]   So my question is, I would like for you to help me think about liability insurance.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.600]   It's one of the topics that is very difficult for me to decide on.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.840]   And I can give you a little bit of information that may be pertinent, and then feel free
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.640]   to ask any other questions that you think are important.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.840]   So I have one member LLC, and this is my primary source of income for myself.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.240]   It's not the only source of income for my household, but that's what I have.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:00.260]   And obviously, many people I know, they have liability insurance, and all sorts of insurances.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.640]   I listened to some of your podcasts about insurances, about asset protection planning,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   and so on and so forth.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:18.240]   And I can't decide what do I need or should consider, and what do I really not need at
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   all.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.440]   So let's begin here.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.080]   Tell me just a little bit about your business.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.880]   You don't have to give specifics unless you want free advertising, but what kind of work
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.080]   are you doing, and what is the liability that you're exposed to?
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   Right.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.760]   So my business is a service business.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.560]   It's essentially a consulting.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.520]   In that particular sense, I do not provide consulting that is associated with liability.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.600]   For example, I do not recommend insurances, or I do not do any regulatory work that has
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.720]   to do with a proper documentation.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   None of that.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   It's more of a, if you were to think about, let's say, market research, that's probably
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.960]   the closest to what I do in terms of liability.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   So in other people who are in your line of work, do they regularly purchase liability
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   insurance?
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.560]   Are there policies available that are tailored to your marketplace?
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:30.160]   That's a good question, because I spoke with several consultants who have been in this
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:39.200]   business for some time, and what they have is only an umbrella policy for themselves,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.000]   and they do not have any other specialized insurance.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.400]   Okay.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   Do you have a physical business location where your clients come and meet with you, or where
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.600]   members of the public come in to that physical business location?
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.440]   No.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.680]   Do you have any physical employees that are actual employees working on premises, or do
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.520]   you just hire some contract work here and there?
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.840]   Only contract work.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.560]   So the short answer is, I think then, with what you're describing, I would not really
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.600]   pursue liability insurance unless there's something that's specifically marketed to
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:27.560]   your occupation, and you say, "Wow, this is a perfect fit for me," and I'll explain how
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.520]   I get there.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.800]   We begin with a disclaimer.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.360]   I have never worked as a liability insurance agent.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.600]   I have spoken to some, but I have never worked in that, and probably if I worked in that
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.580]   business, I would probably be more scared than I am.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:51.300]   So you're just getting kind of a knowledgeable layman's perspective on this, rather than
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.780]   a liability insurance agent's perspective.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.960]   And I would encourage you, this would be a good conversation to speak with a liability
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.260]   insurance agent over.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.180]   And that, for anybody, that would really be your first call.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.340]   Insurance agents are generally, in my experience, very willing to speak to people, and they're
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.100]   the ones who really understand their marketplace.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.340]   But now here is my understanding, which will hopefully give you a little bit of insight
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.620]   as you make a couple of calls locally.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.260]   Let's begin with a philosophy of insurance.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:30.900]   Insurance is a wonderful tool for managing risk, but it's not necessarily the perfect
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.700]   tool for managing all risks.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.740]   Way back in the archives of Radical Personal Finance, just a moment, I'm going to find
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.060]   the show number.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.300]   All right, there it is.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.660]   So back in episode 91 of Radical Personal Finance, Radical Personal Finance episode
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:55.820]   91, first published on October 29, 2014, the show is titled, "Do I Need Insurance?
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.780]   A Mental Model to Analyze Methods of Dealing with Risk."
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:07.860]   In that show, I talked about a model, a framework that you can apply to assessing whether you
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.460]   need insurance to manage a risk.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.620]   We talked about the different ways to look at it.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:24.300]   There are some methods of risk management.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:33.060]   There are some risks that we face that are, if we build a quadrant, we can build a four-part
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.060]   quadrant.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:41.820]   On one axis, we'll talk about is the frequency of risk low or is the frequency of risk high?
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.740]   And then we can build on the other quadrant of our XY graph.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:52.100]   We can discuss whether or not the impact of the risk is low or the impact of the risk
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.520]   is high.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.460]   And then for each quadrant, we will develop an appropriate strategy for how to manage
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.920]   that risk.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:07.220]   And I talk through in that show, I talk about risk avoidance, loss prevention, loss reduction
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.100]   and non-insurance transfers.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.500]   We talk about how you should handle each of those types of risks.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.980]   So I'm not going to repeat that show.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.180]   It's an entire show and I can go back and listen to episode 91 and it'll give you that
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.580]   framework, that mental model that you can use to handle risks.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.380]   So when you begin with that, you recognize that insurance is a really good tool for handling
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   some things.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:37.580]   And what insurance works really well at is controlling for the risks that are very infrequent
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.300]   but yet have a very high potential damage.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.820]   And then we look and say, okay, what are the risks that we're worried about?
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.220]   Well, some of the obvious risks are the things we insure against all the time.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.320]   So that's why I ask you about, do you have business premises?
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.600]   If you, for example, if you have a storefront that's open to the public and somebody comes
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.940]   in and they slip and fall on a slippery floor because water was left there, well, that can
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.380]   be a risk that you have liability in.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:16.420]   It's a very low, like the low frequency risk, but it's something where if somebody sues
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.460]   you successfully for massive injuries that they've suffered as a result of your negligence
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.860]   and having a slippery floor, that could be a very big financial cost to you.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.060]   So what can you do?
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:34.840]   Well, you of course put in place proper structures to make sure that you don't leave a slippery
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840]   floor.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.780]   You wipe up spills, you make sure that there's proper rugs and such at the entrance.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.940]   Then of course you manage your legal liability.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.420]   That's one of the reasons that people put out signs.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.060]   So people put out signs to say slippery floor.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.060]   That does two things.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.960]   Number one is it warns someone that the floor may be slippery, which hopefully will help
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.020]   someone to be more careful and avoid the slip and fall, but then it also helps to mitigate
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.580]   the legal risk that it shows that the shop owner is not being negligent, that they're
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.500]   indicating that there could be a hazard here.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.900]   How all that works out in court, I don't know.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.140]   That's not my area of expertise.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.500]   But something like that is properly insured for.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.860]   And so you would absolutely, if you opened a storefront to the public, you would absolutely
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.620]   maintain an insurance policy that would have provisions for the liability that exposes
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.620]   you to.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.660]   Now in your case, you've done something a little simpler, just simply not have a storefront.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.440]   So you don't need insurance for that if you don't have a storefront.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.580]   Similar things would involve dealing with employees.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.660]   If you have employees, you now are exposed to certain legal risks as a business owner.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.400]   Could be the same exact type of things.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.020]   What happens if your employee slips and falls while they're at work?
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.620]   Well that's where you have liability insurance and that's where you have things like workers
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.060]   compensation plans.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.740]   What about if your employee alleges that they've been harassed or sexually harassed in the
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.900]   workplace that exposes you to liability?
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.260]   And so the simplest way to avoid that is to not have employees, which is a model that
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.260]   I like.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.660]   If you can do everything with contractors, it dramatically limits your liability, makes
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.020]   for a very flexible business.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.500]   It's a little bit easier, but not all businesses can be built with contractors.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.980]   Or you need to insure for those risks.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.900]   So when you have employees, you put all those proper insurance programs in place to protect
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.020]   you from the liabilities that those employees expose you to.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.740]   And so in your situation, you've minimized your liability exposure.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.460]   So then we go down to specific areas of liability.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:50.100]   When I was a licensed financial advisor back in the day, we always carried errors and omissions
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.780]   insurance because the specific professional liability that I was exposed to was if I give
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:03.620]   a recommendation and I make an error or I omit some material fact and my client suffers
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:09.060]   a financial loss, then because due to that risk, I need to be protected from that.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.540]   And so you buy an errors and omissions insurance policy.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:19.700]   And that's standard practice for accountants, for professionals giving professional advice
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.620]   in that context.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.140]   Other kinds of risk that's insured.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:31.120]   In the financial business, there's insurance for broker-dealers where people who are defrauded
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:38.140]   by the broker-dealer, they have access to the SIPC insurance program to protect people
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:44.740]   from fraud by broker-dealers or by insurance agents, depending on which insurance, which
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.180]   part of the financial business they're involved in.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:54.860]   Now if you're primarily involved as a consultant giving advice that is a little bit more general,
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:00.620]   you don't quite have that same risk because you're probably not exposed to that same legal
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.100]   liability.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.420]   The legal liability for a financial advisor is pretty substantial because you're giving
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.420]   advice on potentially large amounts of money and your clients could suffer significant
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.980]   amounts of loss.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.460]   Now it's not that your advice is not unimportant or that somehow they couldn't suffer loss,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.140]   but I think your liability is much more limited.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.860]   And it's especially just simply limited based upon some of the legal doctrines involved
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.140]   in that space.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.900]   Did you do the best that you can?
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.860]   Did you give advice that you thought was right and did the client get what they expected?
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:42.260]   I can't on the spot go through all of those, the legal standards that would be used, but
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.900]   I'm not so worried about it with a model that like you're describing.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.300]   I don't think you have such a significant risk.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.520]   So the way that I would look at it is I would say first, what are my risks?
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.620]   And in your situation, you probably don't have many significant risks.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.940]   And it'd be good of course to speak to an advisor, speak to an attorney and just see
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.300]   if there's any risks that I'm not aware of, but you probably don't have any real significant
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.380]   cases that somebody could make due to liability risk.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.820]   Your most likely risks would be things like perhaps breach of contract or fraud, things
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.820]   like that.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.060]   So if you avoid making fraudulent representations to somebody, if you avoid breaching contracts
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:33.700]   then you do your best job, you've really minimized most of those risks.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.340]   I don't think that there is a significant risk that would need to be protected against
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.220]   for a business like you're describing.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.000]   And then you get to, well, what other tools are available other than insurance?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.900]   If insurance is available, you should consider it.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.180]   But the fact that you didn't come with a specific insurance policy tells me that probably no
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.580]   one's marketing to your industry and I don't even know if it's even available.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.860]   So then you get to, well, how can I protect myself and my personal assets?
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:04.100]   And the simplest solution there is not an insurance policy, it's to use the business
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.740]   structure.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:13.500]   Now in this case, the only thing that is concerning, modestly concerning, is the fact that you're
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.740]   involved in a single member LLC, is that right?
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.740]   Yes.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.740]   Okay.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:26.340]   So a single member LLC does protect you, legally speaking, from some of the risks.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:32.500]   And so the idea is if you're operating under a business infrastructure, you're operating
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:40.580]   a business through a limited liability company, that company has to stand good for any claims
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.660]   against that company.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:48.500]   So if you're operating in your capacity as an employee or manager of that limited liability
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.580]   company, and the company does something that's wrong, and somebody sues the company, and
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:59.500]   they sue the company for $200,000, and they win the lawsuit, then the company assets have
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:06.740]   to stand good for that particular lawsuit.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:12.580]   And in theory, if the limited liability company operates as it should, in theory, then it
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.180]   should protect your personal affairs and your personal assets from the operations of the
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180]   company.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:24.700]   And as long as you don't have personal liability in your conduct in some way, then that should
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.380]   protect some of your other assets.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.620]   Now here's where it gets tricky.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:34.360]   That's very easy to teach when we're talking about the value of a limited liability company.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:40.100]   But my understanding is that basically, if somebody's going to sue your company, they're
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:46.700]   all automatically going to name you as an individual as a defendant in the lawsuit as
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.700]   well.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.980]   They're going to sue both you and your company.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.180]   And so most of the way that I would manage risk if I were in a situation like you is
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:01.140]   to make sure that you're very careful about maintaining a clear wall of separation between
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.780]   the business of the company and you as an individual.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.700]   And this is where a lot of people really do break down, especially with a small, closely
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.340]   held company where you're the only person operating in that company.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:24.340]   It can be a real danger here for you to be too closely associated with that company.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:30.180]   So here are a couple of practical best practices that I think you want to make sure of.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.020]   First, anytime you're doing business, it's very important that you always are very clear
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:42.700]   that this is the LLC itself that is contracting with somebody for the work.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.140]   You never sign contracts yourself.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.460]   You always make sure that the LLC and you are a representative of the LLC, that that's
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.580]   who is actually signing the contract.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.740]   You make sure that all of your paperwork clearly indicates that they're doing business with
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.580]   a limited liability company and that your name is just simply here and there as a representative
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.980]   of that company, but that everything is with the company.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.180]   Your website is with the company.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.660]   All your documents are with the company.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.900]   The business card is with the company.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.580]   I think that it's important to do things like make sure that you have separate email accounts.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.660]   So you would never send, you don't interact with clients as an individual.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.060]   You interact with clients underneath your company email account.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.340]   I think that it's important to do things like have separate phone numbers, separate phone
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.100]   lines.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.180]   It's worth it, in my opinion, to carry two cell phones if you need to.
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.320]   One is the company cell phone, one is your cell phone.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.260]   Don't mix those things because if you're careful about following those simple rules, the money
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.940]   goes into the business account.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:50.220]   The business account pays you as the member of the LLC a salary or an income, but everything
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.980]   is carefully, nothing is commingled.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:58.140]   Then you do a good job of building that strong corporate wall and you dramatically minimize
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.580]   the risk that a judge would come along and would be willing to pierce the corporate veil
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.900]   and try to come after you personally.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.620]   Now the reason I asked about the single member LLC, it's unclear to me.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:16.460]   I do know that when you get to the perspective of asset protection, a single member LLC is
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.940]   not as robust as a multi-member LLC.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:29.300]   A single member LLC is the most, is the very best and simplest LLC that you can do from
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.780]   the sheer ease of operations.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.820]   And so they're great to set up, they're fast to set up, they're easy.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.100]   The IRS completely disregards them, they're a totally disregarded entity.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.660]   So that makes your tax and your business structure very, very simple.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:51.740]   But they have a higher exposure of risk and a higher ability to be pierced by a judge
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.580]   than a multi-member LLC or some other form of corporation.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.860]   So I think that if you were talking with an asset protection attorney and that attorney
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.660]   were giving you advice, what that attorney would like to see is that attorney would like
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:09.320]   to see some intermediary that is not a single member LLC between you and the company.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.460]   Is that worth it in your situation?
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.860]   I have no idea.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.740]   But we're just kind of going through the theory.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.580]   The theory is that if you're going to operate as a single member LLC, it might be smart
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.180]   to go ahead and have another entity own that single member LLC and make sure that there
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:28.940]   are multiple people involved in that other entity because that adds a greater structure
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.760]   to it.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.980]   And then the other thing that you have to look at is just simply looking at your personal
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   assets.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.460]   Are you vulnerable?
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.980]   Are your other assets vulnerable?
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.980]   You listened to my asset protection series.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.380]   If your assets, let's say that you have a home and that home is in a, you live in a
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:56.500]   state where you've got significant homestead protection laws, your other assets are in
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.540]   qualified accounts that are protected either by federal law or perhaps IRAs and such that
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.100]   are protected by your state.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.520]   You don't have a lot of money exposed so that even if someone did sue you, you'd be very
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.020]   hard to collect on.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.420]   I think that you make a judgment call and say, "I'm pretty good here."
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.980]   But if all of a sudden you have actually $10 million and that $10 million is sitting in
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.020]   a checking account, then now all of a sudden it becomes worth it to go ahead and add in
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.420]   another corporate layer with multiple members and we want to put a little bit more distance
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.780]   between us and this business that we're operating.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:38.300]   So my guess is, my hunch is you don't need liability insurance for the reasons stated.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.220]   You're probably fine operating through the business entity, but be a good student and
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.220]   make sure number one, talk to a liability insurance agent.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.180]   See if there even is an insurance policy that could protect you from any risks that you
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.860]   do have.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.860]   Be very, very careful about running your affairs cleanly.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:03.580]   Most of the times when a corporate liability structure breaks down, I think most of the
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:09.100]   time, it's my understanding that most of the time that's due to carelessness by the business
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.100]   operator.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.500]   So don't be careless.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.080]   Make sure that your materials are clear.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.300]   Make sure your contracts are clear.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:21.420]   Make sure it's very clear that you are not doing business as an individual, that rather
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.620]   you're doing business as a representative of this limited liability company.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.220]   And then think about your personal risks.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.860]   And if those things are simple and you're good with keeping your corporate formalities,
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.600]   etc., then I think you're probably safe enough.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.740]   And I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.740]   Thank you.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:54.340]   Yeah, it seems to me that I do follow all these rules that you recommended to look into.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.340]   And do you think that...
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:01.820]   So sometimes I'm not sure whether something can be done even cleaner or maybe I forgot
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.820]   something.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:10.060]   Maybe it's a conversation also with my accountant to see if they think that everything looks
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   just like it should be or if I could make it better.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   There's an endless...
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.460]   Yes, you should have those conversations.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.860]   Here's the challenge.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.220]   You've got to be practical about it.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.580]   There is an endless amount of things that you could do to make it better.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:35.520]   But every step to making it better adds cost and complexity and hassle.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:42.580]   So it's a judgment call as to where is the right balance between this is good, this should
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:52.060]   work and this is smooth and simple and streamlined and this will work effectively.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.940]   There's no bright line between these.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.780]   It's a judgment call.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:02.340]   If I were involved in a very risky business, something that had significant amounts of
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.300]   liability and so let's talk about things that would increase.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:12.980]   If I'm running a restaurant where now all of a sudden I have massive exposure to the
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:19.980]   public and I've got a lot of employees, your risks just go way up compared to what you're
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.980]   doing.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:30.620]   So if you're operating equipment, you're running a road construction equipment company with
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:36.140]   millions of dollars of heavy equipment that could crush somebody who runs into it on the
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:42.920]   side of the road or that some careless employee backs over somebody behind them.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.340]   Those are things where the liability just goes up through the roof.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:53.980]   And so your whole profile changes and now everything becomes much, much more important.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:59.340]   But from what I'm hearing from your situation, your situation is fairly simple.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:06.460]   And so I think the natural limited liability of the limited liability company, that's the
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.660]   goal of an LLC, is probably sufficient.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.580]   Now I would not keep tons of money in the company unless you need it.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.340]   You have to have enough money in the company to need it, but I wouldn't keep tons of assets
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.340]   there.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.140]   I wouldn't co-mingle my activities in this business with my activities anywhere else.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.320]   You want to make sure there's clear separation there.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.140]   You want to make sure that you're just working in one line of business in this particular
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.140]   company.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.540]   But as long as you're doing those things, I think you're probably okay.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:41.180]   But continually solicit professional advice on the subject.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.820]   Okay, one last very small point.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:53.100]   I actually thought that maybe keeping a sufficient amount of capital in the company is actually
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   a good thing.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.540]   But now you're saying maybe don't, I mean, again, we don't know what sufficient is or
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.100]   what's ton mean.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:05.820]   But I thought that if there isn't a significant amount of money in the company, then it kind
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:13.060]   of shows the capitalization of the company and also maybe satisfies the claims of whoever
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.300]   is going after the company.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.660]   And I thought, okay, if it's very little, then they may not be satisfied and they would
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:26.500]   want to go after a person and try to find any way to pierce the corporate veil.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.540]   You are correct in that.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.820]   One of the hallmarks, one of the things that judges will look at when deciding whether
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:39.780]   or not to respect the corporate structure or whether to pierce the corporate veil, one
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:46.140]   thing they will look at is, was the company sufficiently capitalized in an appropriate
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.660]   way for that company?
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.880]   So when you capitalize a company, you need to make sure that you capitalize it to an
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.620]   appropriate level for that company.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:00.920]   Now, operating a consultancy, that number is probably thousands of dollars, not hundreds
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.660]   of thousands of dollars.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.620]   But on the other hand, if you are operating something that has a very large working budget,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.900]   you need to capitalize that company to an appropriate level.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.540]   The key is, it just needs to be appropriate.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.700]   And then as long as it's appropriate for your industry, for the company type, et cetera,
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.700]   then you're good.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.160]   But that absolutely is one of the things that somebody will look at.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.180]   You additionally then, of course, would want to keep an appropriate amount of working capital
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.180]   in the company.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:35.540]   If you're going to operate this clearly as a separate entity, this is not your money,
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.780]   this is the company's money.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.820]   And just like you would always make sure that you have enough money in your checking account
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.180]   to do business, the company needs to have enough money in their checking account to
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.320]   do business.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.340]   But if with a consultancy, perhaps your business expenses are a few thousand dollars per month,
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:57.460]   then there's no need to have hundreds of thousands of dollars in a business checking account.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.180]   Some thousands or perhaps $10,000 should be sufficient.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:08.380]   What I would caution you about is exposing assets unnecessarily to liability.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:15.460]   So one of the principal ideas of asset protection planning is anywhere there is liability, we
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:24.780]   try to seek to constrain that liability to a structure that doesn't have a lot of assets.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:30.140]   And anywhere there's a lot of assets, we try to make sure that that structure doesn't have
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.100]   a lot of exposure.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:38.100]   So the simplest example would be back to the heavy equipment example.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:45.700]   If you're operating a business that has a lot of liability and you've got a million
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:51.740]   dollars of heavy equipment for a road construction company, well, that's a big asset.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.180]   That's a lot of equipment right there.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:59.820]   And you've got tremendous liability that is going to be created by the operation of
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.940]   that company.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.260]   You've got liability exposure for employees.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.500]   You've got liability exposure to customers.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:12.100]   You've got liability exposure for onlookers and bystanders, property damage, et cetera.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.900]   And you've got a million dollars of equipment sitting here in this company.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:24.780]   So the simple solution is somebody could sue the company and they could assess the million
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.460]   dollars of equipment as part of what they could collect on.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.020]   They may not be able to pierce all the way through to the owner's personal assets, but
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.860]   they could access this million dollars of equipment.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:41.500]   And so my understanding, what an attorney would recommend in a situation like that is
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.940]   you would try to segment the liability to a structure with fewer assets and you would
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.340]   try to move the assets into a structure where there's not going to be liability created.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:56.500]   And so instead of the company that's doing the operating company owning all the equipment,
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:02.060]   you would have a holding company separately owned by a few different people.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.140]   And hopefully some of those people are not involved in the business.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.460]   So let's say my wife and I were running a road construction business.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.860]   I think we would set up a family holding company that owned equipment.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.780]   And that's the family holding company that owns all the equipment for business.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.300]   But then we would establish leasing contracts and that equipment would be leased to the
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.860]   operating company.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:29.580]   So now that million dollars of assets are not necessarily exposed to the operating company
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.580]   itself.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.180]   Now, we would get good legal advice.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:40.700]   My understanding, legal advisors would make recommendations such as having multiple unconnected
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.540]   people involved in the leasing company.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.180]   That would be intelligent from a tax strategy as well.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.620]   So my wife and I might be shareholders in that company.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.500]   My children might also be shareholders in that company.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:33:02.940]   We would also possibly lease equipment to other companies so it wasn't just simply that
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.380]   this was our only customer.
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.180]   It's fine if it's our primary customer, but we don't want it to be our only customer.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:17.100]   And in following those practices, we can now make a really good case that these assets
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.540]   should not be exposed to the liability that's being generated inside the operating company
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:27.820]   any more than the fact that in our operating company, we go to another big commercial leasing
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.340]   agency and we lease a Bobcat for the day.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.060]   Well, the company that's leasing us the Bobcat doesn't have any liability for what we do
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.700]   with the Bobcat.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.740]   They're just simply leasing the Bobcat to us.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:46.060]   So you look at liability and you see how do we constrain this liability inside of a company
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.940]   with fewer assets that are at risk and how do we make sure that in the companies that
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:59.420]   we hold assets in that we don't generate liability risks inside those companies.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.380]   One more example, you do the same thing with employees.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.760]   One of the big risks is to have is employees.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.940]   Employees can bring tremendous liability risks to a business operator.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.780]   And so through a variety of mechanisms, you try to move that employee risk to a structure
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.260]   that doesn't have a lot of assets.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.560]   So you see this with employee leasing companies.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.560]   You see this with using contractors for labor instead of employees.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.820]   And then you keep the assets tucked aside where you're not going to generate liability
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.020]   inside of that company.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.820]   So this all has to be done at appropriate scale, but those are the basic principles
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.220]   that are applied.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:41.380]   To your situation, all of this sounds unnecessary as long as you follow good corporate formalities,
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:49.220]   which by the way, one of the areas of weakness is because LLCs are so simple to create and
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:56.660]   because you don't have the same requirements of corporate record keeping, of annual meetings,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:02.220]   all those things, people often are very lax with that and they basically run the LLC as
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.860]   an alter ego.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.500]   I think that creates danger.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:11.020]   And I think that if somebody is prudent, you should run your LLC exactly like you run a
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:18.060]   corporation and keep the same structure, keep the same habits in place because that helps
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.140]   you in the worst case scenario if you're ever in front of a lawsuit.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.140]   That's my answer, Anne.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   Thank you.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.140]   That's very good.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   Thank you so much.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.140]   My pleasure.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.140]   Anything else?
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.140]   Only if you have one.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.140]   Go ahead.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.140]   Go ahead.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.140]   I've got two other callers on the line, but I've got time for one more.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.140]   Go ahead.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.140]   Okay.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   One more.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:49.380]   This probably doesn't matter, but the fact that my LLC is taxed as S corporation, does
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.940]   it change anything in terms of what you said?
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.980]   Or it doesn't really matter at all because it's only...
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.060]   No, that doesn't change anything.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.340]   The tax corporation status is simply an arrangement with the IRS and that is independent of these
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.140]   principles, these legal principles that we're discussing.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   Right.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.500]   That's what I thought.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.100]   Well, thank you so much.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.100]   My pleasure.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   All right.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   We go on now to, it looks like James.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.100]   James, welcome to the show.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.100]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.100]   Can you hear me?
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.100]   Sounds good.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.100]   Go ahead.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.100]   Excellent.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.100]   All right.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:32.060]   So this has to go back to a couple of weeks ago when you did the episode, the first episode
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:40.180]   on your podcast about your dealings with dieting and overweight, being overweight, like different
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.380]   periods throughout your life.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:49.300]   My question about that is, first off, the statement that I can relate in that I am overweight
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:56.140]   and have been different degrees of overweight throughout my life, but relatively healthy,
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.020]   no chronic health issues related to my weight.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.020]   I have had trouble getting insurance.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.140]   And I remember distinctly, I was driving when I was listening to your podcast, you said
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.540]   something along the lines of like, you've always had premium top of the line life insurance.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.740]   I might've said health insurance earlier, but I meant life insurance.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:24.020]   And I wanted to just ask you to unpack that if you don't mind, because I have a family
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:29.420]   with a young child and I definitely want to make sure that I have coverage, whether it's
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.700]   through work or not.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:38.060]   And I just want to know maybe what my options were, given that I share some similar physical
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.020]   history as you.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.900]   So this is one of the areas where working with a good insurance agent should solve this
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.900]   problem.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.540]   So I'm curious, when you have applied for insurance before, did you use an agent?
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.540]   Did you use a website?
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.420]   What did you do previously?
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:02.820]   It was always through like, I got a new job, I'm signing up to get my benefits and I'll
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.820]   sign up for life insurance.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:08.220]   And they'll say, you know, based off of the information you input about yourself, like
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.140]   we can give you up to a certain amount, like a low amount, like $200,000 or something like
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.140]   that.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.140]   Right.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   Right.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.300]   And essentially, I kind of just felt like I was not going to get any more insurance
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.300]   from them.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.660]   And I kind of just took it as like, okay, well, I'm overweight and that's the way things
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.660]   are.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.500]   But obviously, I want to revisit that.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   Right.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.620]   So my other caller dropped off.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.220]   So I'm going to give you a little bit of time and I'm going to give you a mini lesson on
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.500]   how you as a young father should go around getting insurance.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.380]   And it'll be a refresher for others who need this as well.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:46.740]   So let's begin with first, personal versus group insurance.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.700]   Many people buy life insurance and all of this is about life insurance.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.780]   Every line of insurance is different.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.300]   Dental insurance and health insurance and life insurance and disability insurance.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.780]   These are all unique lines of insurance and there's different advice for each and every
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.820]   one of them.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.620]   So we're exclusively here talking about life insurance.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:12.180]   When it comes to life insurance, many people buy their life insurance through their job,
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.900]   the way that you have done.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.860]   First, that is not ideal.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.380]   And the reason it's not ideal is for is reasons that it's not ideal is these.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:27.020]   First, if you buy life insurance through your job, then if you leave your job, you lose
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.060]   your life insurance.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.540]   Some policies will have conversion privileges.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.380]   Sometimes you can take it with you.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.380]   For the most part though, you can't.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.940]   Or at least you can't take it with you at a rate you can afford.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:47.540]   So for example, some life insurance that's issued through a group contract will be issued
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.280]   as a term insurance policy.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.020]   But then when you leave, yeah, you can keep the policy, but you have to convert it to
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.180]   a permanent life insurance policy, a whole life policy.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.760]   You probably can't afford that increase in premiums.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:03.360]   So Joshua's first rule of life insurance, don't buy life insurance through your job.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:10.380]   Always buy life insurance through a personal policy that is underwritten for you personally.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.460]   Unless you can't get life insurance or you can't get life insurance at a good rate personally,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:20.140]   and then you go and look to see if you can get life insurance through your job.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.940]   There are a few different ways that life insurance policies are underwritten.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.140]   So you have policies that are fully underwritten.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.980]   So if you decide to go out and you contact an insurance agent, you say, "I want to own
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:39.740]   a million dollar life insurance policy," that insurance agent will underwrite the policy.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.500]   Insurance agents are actually called field underwriters.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.940]   It's not really used anymore.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:49.460]   But the idea is that the first method of underwriting that the insurance company uses is the individual
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.460]   life insurance agent.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:56.300]   So the life insurance agent is keeping their eyes open when they're in your house for fraud.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.780]   They're keeping their eyes open for are you telling the truth.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.020]   And they have a legal duty to the company when they fill out an insurance application
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:08.620]   that the information on that application is truthful and that they don't have any additional
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:14.060]   knowledge about any reason why the applicant is reporting information that is not truthful.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:19.980]   But when the company does that, they fully underwrite the policy on a personal basis.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.740]   And so what they do is they will send a nurse out.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.300]   They'll do a medical exam.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.880]   That medical exam will involve a full medical history questionnaire where you respond to
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.740]   all these detailed questions.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:37.420]   They will solicit all of your doctor records from any doctor visits, usually in about the
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.320]   last five to 10 years.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.640]   But if it's significant, they can go back farther than that.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.660]   And they'll collect all your medical records.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.660]   And the underwriter in the home office of the insurance company will read all those
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.460]   medical records.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:56.820]   All your medical information will go into a centralized depository of health information
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.020]   that the insurance companies access.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.660]   And then the individual nurse will take a current measurement.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.660]   They'll put you on a scale, find out what your current weight is.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.380]   They'll take your blood pressure.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.220]   Depending on the amount of insurance, they will take a urine sample.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.800]   They'll take a blood sample.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.460]   If you're applying for several millions of dollars of insurance, there will be a heart
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.460]   EKG.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   They'll do an EKG.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.040]   They'll do a field EKG.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.480]   When you're underwriting very large policies, they'll bring somebody in, put them on a treadmill,
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.400]   do some of the stress tests and very advanced tests, depending on the amount of insurance.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.240]   Now, when you're dealing in the million, two million, three million dollar range of insurance,
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.340]   those things are fairly simple.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:43.820]   If you're buying small policies of a few hundred thousand dollars, often it's just a urine
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.680]   sample and a blood pressure.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.120]   If you're buying very small policies, the insurance agent will do the whole thing themselves.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:56.800]   So if I didn't sell much, because I could usually get somebody at least a half a million
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.040]   dollars of insurance, but you never know.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.560]   If you sell a hundred thousand dollar insurance policy, they would do a mouth swab.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:10.280]   And the mouth swab has some information and I carried a kit in the back of my car, so
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.120]   if I needed to do it right there, I would do the medical history questionnaire and a
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.920]   mouth swab and that's good enough for a hundred thousand dollars of insurance.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:22.120]   But all of those policies are underwritten on an individual basis, where the company
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.320]   has the right to decline the coverage if they don't like it, or they have the right to rate
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:31.080]   the coverage, meaning they'll charge you whatever you want to be charged, whatever they decide
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.320]   they want to charge you.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.640]   And you'll know that eventually, before you accept the policy, you'll know exactly what
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.920]   the rate's going to be based upon the individual underwriting of the insurance company.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:48.000]   Now there are other ways, however, of providing insurance.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.720]   There is a standard of insurance called simplified issue.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:58.000]   And what simplified issue means is the insurance company is going to offer insurance policies
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.440]   to a group of people, there usually needs to be an affiliation of some kind, so this
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.960]   is often people all working at a company or all part of a certain group of people, and
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   you just simply have to answer some basic questions, maybe your height, your weight,
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.400]   a little bit of your family history, but they're not going to make you go through the full
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.700]   line of underwriting.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.020]   And that's simplified issue.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.800]   In simplified issue, they still have the opportunity to charge you more, so if your weight is a
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.680]   little bit too high, they'll say, "We're going to increase your premiums because of that."
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.280]   Or if you have a bad family history, "We're going to change your premiums because of that."
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   That's called simplified issue.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.160]   And then the third is what's called guaranteed issue, where the insurance company guarantees
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:42.360]   that we will issue a contract, a life insurance policy, on everybody who is within this affinity
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.520]   group, usually a company.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.680]   And with guaranteed issue, they don't ask you any questions, they just simply say, "We'll
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.920]   give it to you."
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.400]   Now with guaranteed issue, you can recognize there's a tremendous liability exposure that
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.200]   the insurance company has.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.960]   Let's say that I've smoked eight packs of cigarettes a day, my father died of cancer
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:07.880]   at 42, my mom died of cancer at 43, I've had six heart attacks, and I have four stents,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:16.240]   and all of a sudden I'm 41, and I decide that I want to go and get a life insurance policy.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:23.600]   Well, if I just go down to XYZ company, and I come into that XYZ company, and I say, "Hey,
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.600]   here I am.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.800]   Now you've got to give me half a million dollars of life insurance company."
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.560]   That could destroy the integrity of the group of insureds that the insurance company has.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.720]   And so they want to guard against that.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.440]   Well, the way to guard against that is usually by limiting those guaranteed issue contracts
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:44.960]   to relatively small face amounts of insurance, usually $50,000, maybe $200,000.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.160]   It's got to be small.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.280]   You generally don't get those with millions of dollars.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.520]   Sometimes, depending on the affinity group, because of the basic characteristics of the
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   group, an insurance company will be a little bit more liberal with the size of the contracts
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.520]   they'll issue.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.720]   So you'll see this with things like a bar association, or a CPA group, or something
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   like that.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:13.240]   Lawyers and accountants and lawyers, these are often relatively low-risk people, and
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.580]   they're at a fairly low risk of dying.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.340]   People are usually intelligent.
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:24.420]   And so if somebody's going to be an attorney, there are lots of attorneys that smoke cigarettes.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:29.620]   But on a class basis, I would bet you five bucks that there are far fewer attorneys who
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:35.540]   smoke cigarettes every day than there are construction workers, than there are janitors,
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:41.260]   etc., because the kind of person that becomes an attorney has a different health profile
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.060]   than the kind of person who takes an entry-level job.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.580]   So the insurance company knows this, and so sometimes they'll offer higher simplified
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:57.700]   issue or higher guaranteed issue policy amounts to some of those very low-risk groups.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:01.460]   And that's how it works.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.300]   Now back to you as an individual versus a group.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.140]   If you can get insurance yourself, you should always buy it yourself.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:14.340]   And the first reason that I already said was that you can take it with you when you leave
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.140]   your job and you can maintain your insurance coverage.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:23.060]   The second reason why, or a second reason why, you should buy the policy individually
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.540]   is that you can often get better rates.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:32.540]   Because of the risk that the insurance company faces of the potential for what's called adverse
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.800]   selection, people who know they're sick and they're going to die coming to that company
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:41.500]   and intentionally getting it, that's called adverse selection.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:47.860]   Because of the risk, I've been smoking too many cigarettes today, because of the risk
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:55.700]   that the company faces, the group policies are issued at higher rates to protect the
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.700]   company.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.100]   So sometimes you can save a lot of money as an individual by just simply having a policy
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:06.540]   that's underwritten for you as an individual versus through your group contract.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:10.940]   I've seen that many times where if you're just buying a standard term insurance contract,
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:16.300]   you can save significant money by buying that policy yourself than through the group.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:21.540]   You don't really get much group benefit as far as, there's not a lot of benefit to the
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.100]   insurance company of taking on those group contracts.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.280]   They like to have more insureds, they like to sell more business.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.220]   So there is some ability, they don't have to pay as many agent commissions as they do
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.220]   in the individual side.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.940]   So there may be some cost savings, but the risk of adverse selection undoes a lot of
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   those things.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.060]   So it depends on the person, depends on the company, all of this is highly variable, but
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.180]   you can often save money as an individual as compared to a group.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:52.260]   And then also, there's often very little incentive to buy group insurance.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:58.220]   The company that offers you benefits can give you a tax-free benefit of up to $50,000 of
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.500]   life insurance, term life insurance.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:05.260]   And so many companies will automatically give $50,000 as a nice group benefit as a tax-free
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.260]   benefit.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.060]   But anything more than that, you have to pay for.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.900]   And if the company is paying for it, then that's a taxable benefit to you.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:17.340]   So that's not particularly favorable in many group benefit plans because of the tax structure.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:23.500]   That changes when we move into executive benefit planning, where oftentimes a healthy life
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.220]   insurance executive benefit can be carved out.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.460]   But just for most people who are involved in most aspects of the group benefits marketplace
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.260]   in the United States, life insurance, you're not going to get a lot of life insurance benefits
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.720]   at work.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.980]   So always buy it yourself as an individual.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.460]   And you get the opportunity when you're buying it yourself as an individual to have full
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.900]   underwriting done that takes into account the totality of your circumstances.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:56.380]   Now next part of Joshua's lecture on insurance, insurance agent versus website or something
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.380]   like that.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:07.620]   I see no benefit to ever buying from a website versus working with a local insurance agent.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.620]   I'm not aware of any specific companies, although I have this nagging feeling in the back of
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:15.780]   my head that there are at least a couple of insurance companies that are now selling insurance
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.300]   policies without commissions, but it's not a meaningful part of the market insurance
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.780]   marketplace at all.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:28.640]   So insurance companies pay commissions to agents who sell their policies.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:36.820]   And those insurance commission rates are basically the same no matter who sells the policy.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.660]   I won't go into the exceptions.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.260]   Basically it's good enough.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.500]   So I can sell insurance in two ways.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:47.180]   I can be an individual life insurance agent and I can say go ahead and come in and I'll
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.300]   work with you as an individual.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.220]   Or if I want to make a lot of money in the insurance business, I simply set up an insurance
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.140]   website.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:00.900]   I get licensed agents who work in my insurance agency, but our method of marketing is through
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.940]   a website and through the phone.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:08.020]   But you often don't get as experienced agents or as knowledgeable agents in that kind of
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:13.660]   marketplace as you do with an individual agent, life insurance agent, who's made their career
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.380]   out of life insurance.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.900]   When I was doing this business, I was a life insurance agent.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:23.580]   I knew far more about life insurance than anybody who would ever be working a phone
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.500]   at a website.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.640]   And I could bring that expertise to my clients.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.260]   And so if I sold a policy, you could go to termlifeinsurance.com or whatever, that's
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.980]   just a generic name for whatever website is out there.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:43.000]   And that life insurance general agent would have established an agency, they established
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.420]   contracts with a half a dozen different companies.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:51.740]   Might be Banner, might be Prudential, might be AXA, whatever the companies are of the
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.740]   day.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.640]   And so they would sell those policies.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:58.160]   But I had exactly those same companies that I was contracted with.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.900]   But the difference was you got the access to the knowledgeable agent versus the sometimes
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:09.100]   basic, all the telephone representatives, they're knowledgeable enough to pass an insurance
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   exam.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.280]   But that doesn't mean that they're deeply knowledgeable in the space.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.480]   And I get paid the same commission as the owner of that agency gets paid.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.120]   So why wouldn't somebody want to come and work with me as a knowledgeable life insurance
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.480]   agent instead of working through the website?
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   There's no cost savings that can be gotten by the customer.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:35.520]   It's just simply a marketing operation for the company.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.880]   I don't have any problem with that business model.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.720]   But as an individual, I can't make a clear recommendation that you should go and use
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.000]   a website as your primary source of searching for insurance.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.440]   I don't see the benefit.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:56.480]   You don't save any money and I don't think you're going to access as high of a caliber
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.600]   of insurance agent through that system.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.560]   The people that would be representatives at that kind of company, at a website-based company,
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   are people who are intelligent enough to pass the life insurance exam.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.560]   They got to be licensed agents.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.440]   But they're probably not going to be committed necessarily to the life insurance business.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.360]   They're not going to be as aggressive.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.960]   They're not going to have the incentives to become as knowledgeable as I think an individual
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.080]   agent could be.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.540]   Now you measure that for yourself.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.280]   That's my personal experience and I'm biased because of the path that I took.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.720]   I'm sure there are excellent insurance agencies that are doing most of their business through
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.680]   call-in business, etc.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.160]   But with my experience, I don't see any reason to go that route.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.320]   Which brings me now to the specific answer to your question.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.520]   One of the things that's important when you're getting insurance is you want the ability
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.880]   to work with an insurance agent who has access to a broad number of companies and who has
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.720]   knowledge of those different companies underwriting standards.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.960]   There are different ways that insurance companies underwrite policies.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.880]   For basic purposes, most insurance companies will have a tier of premiums that they charge
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:13.480]   based upon something like they have a standard rate, then they may have a preferred rate
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.400]   or a super preferred rate.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   So standard is here's what a standard person of standard health and standard family history
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.960]   and standard weight, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, gets as standard.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.040]   But then preferred is if you're skinnier or you're healthier or your parents are older
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.800]   or super preferred, everything is in your favor.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.360]   And then they have what are called their table ratings.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.280]   It might be table one, table two, table three, all the way down to 10, 12, 15, whatever.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:40.080]   And so you say, "Well, I had a cancer diagnosis eight years ago, but since then everything
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.080]   is good."
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.200]   All right, we're going to give you table one.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:49.680]   Your premiums are adjusted based upon where you come in at this level on these tables.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   Now different insurance companies though have different ways that they arrive at their rating
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.480]   based upon their inside actuaries experience.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.440]   And so speaking simply, they basically fall into two different categories.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:11.200]   Some insurance companies models will kick you down to a lower rating if you fail one
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.640]   certain thing.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.400]   So this sounds like what happens to you based upon the underwriting methodology that you
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.880]   went into.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.280]   They said, "Hey, James has, his heart is great.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.360]   No history of heart disease.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.120]   Mom and dad didn't have heart disease.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.280]   Mom and dad are still alive and they're 99 years old.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   James doesn't smoke.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   That's great.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.880]   James has great blood pressure.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.880]   James is totally healthy.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.240]   He's a little bit fat.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.960]   BMI over this number.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.280]   And because of that, because the BMI is over that, that automatically drops James from
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.480]   he's not super preferred that automatically puts him into standard rates.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:51.800]   But other companies use a pointing system, a point system where they'll say, "All right,
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.840]   everybody starts at standard and James's mom and dad are 99 years old and they're in perfect
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   health.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.360]   So plus 10 points, plus 10 points.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.760]   James has perfect blood pressure, plus eight points.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.920]   James has no family history of cancer, plus four points.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.120]   James runs.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.440]   James doesn't drink alcohol, plus plus.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.920]   But James's BMI is, he's a little bit fat.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.400]   Okay, minus six points.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.800]   Total it all up, we came up to 42 points.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.400]   So that puts James right in our preferred category.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   42, you know, 40 points and above is still preferred.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.520]   And that gives a little bit of wiggle room.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:31.200]   Nobody except the companies and experienced people know each of the different companies
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.880]   structures.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:38.680]   So what I prefer that you do is you contact a knowledgeable agent and then you, and you
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.280]   apply with that knowledgeable agent, you go through the underwriting process.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.480]   And then if you get rated with one company, look to see if there's another company that
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:54.920]   is willing to make you an offer of a better quote.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.600]   And so that way you at least know if you're going to get rated, you know you got rated
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.040]   with 12 companies or 15 companies or whatever instead of just the one company that kicked
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.120]   you out.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.800]   So back when I was an agent with a big mutual company, that was always what I would do is
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.880]   I would always start with the company, I was a Northwestern Mutual agent.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:17.440]   I would start with Northwestern Mutual and put people and do that and start with that.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.000]   Unless then if somebody got rated with Northwestern Mutual, I'd take that policy and I would shop
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.720]   it to other companies and see what quotes we got back and then come back and see, well,
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.720]   what were the opportunities there?
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:35.240]   And what I often found was a lot of variability in the offers that we would get.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:39.640]   And so in one of the reasons is based upon this system of underwriting.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:45.440]   So with my life insurance, Northwestern Mutual was one of those points-based companies where
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.440]   they would do it based upon a totality of points.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:53.040]   I had a stellar family history, I had stellar blood pressure, I had stellar, I don't know,
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.520]   cholesterol, all the rest of this stuff.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.760]   I have no history of chronic disease whatsoever in my family, very high longevity.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.360]   So even though my BMI was high, I always got preferred, whatever that came up, Premier,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.800]   I guess it was Northwestern Mutual's name for it.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.320]   I always got the best rates because of that.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:14.720]   And it was due to some of this inside insurance industry stuff that we're talking about here.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:22.160]   So the end of the day, you got to find a company that's willing to make you an offer.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.120]   But if you shop around, you can get good rates.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:31.200]   And just because you're a little bit fat doesn't mean that you can't get a better price.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.340]   Now of course, stop being fat if you can, work hard on getting less fat and then go
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.620]   ahead and get it better.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:41.340]   And that's also one of the important things that you should do.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:46.960]   So back when I did that business professionally and I would talk to people, you say, "Okay,
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.180]   well this company, you got a preferred rating here, but here's your target.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.040]   The reason we got a preferred rating," we'd talk to the underwriter, the underwriter would
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.100]   say, "Here's why this person got a standard rating.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:03.020]   But if you can go from standard to preferred, it'll drop your premiums by $40.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.540]   So Mr. Client, here is my challenge for you.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.480]   Drop your body weight 40 pounds.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.000]   And if you can drop 40 pounds, then we can apply for reconsideration in one year, two
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   years or whatever."
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.380]   And that's the other thing is that whenever an underwriter rates a policy, they'll tell
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.880]   you whether there's reconsideration available or not.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:25.760]   And so sometimes with significant, somebody, you're getting a policy for somebody who's
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.540]   had a history of heart attacks or history of cancer, they'll say, "Rating is table one,
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.480]   no reconsideration available."
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.040]   But if somebody has a high BMI, they'll say, "Okay, it's going to be right now a standard
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.680]   rating for now, but reconsideration is available in one year or two years."
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:47.360]   And so then the person should get the policy because if you are getting rated by a life
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.520]   insurance company, that's a good clue that you need more life insurance because they
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.320]   really want to sell the policy.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.040]   And if they're going to charge you more, they're charging you more because the risk of your
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.300]   dying soon is a lot higher.
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:03.440]   So there's my sales pitch for how to sell rated policies if you're an insurance agent.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.720]   If you get rated by an insurance company, the need for life insurance just went up.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:12.560]   And so that's why you should definitely buy it if you got rated.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.400]   Doesn't always work, but it's true and so often people find that persuasive.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.200]   But then the challenge is lose 40 pounds, keep it off and apply for reconsideration
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   in a year.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.380]   And when you do that, we can drop you up or bump you up to the next health classification.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:32.680]   Your premiums will drop by $500 a year and now that should give you some additional incentive
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.600]   to lose fat.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.160]   So that's Joshua's mini lecture on life insurance, James.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.820]   It's going to be a matter of finding a knowledgeable agent and finding somebody who is willing
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.280]   to put in that legwork for you.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.720]   And the same thing applies if somebody has risk factors.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:55.000]   Same thing applies if you have a bad family history or bad cancer, etc.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.320]   The key is to shop around.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.000]   There are thousands, but realistically there are hundreds of life insurance companies and
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.520]   most life insurance agents that do it professionally are contracted and appointed with at least
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.040]   a couple dozen.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.800]   And so you want to work with somebody who's going to shop it around and get you the best
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   deal.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:20.040]   And a lot of times this is where competition really can play a role.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.640]   That was extremely educating.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:22.640]   Thank you.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   Good.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:31.600]   I have one more clarifying question because I occasionally listen to Dave Ramsey and he
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:40.320]   talks about term versus whole and I will admit I don't really understand what I should be
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.760]   having given my situation.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.360]   So could you touch on that if you have a minute?
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   Sure.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.240]   So in general, the rule is very simple.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.440]   You buy term life insurance for all insurance needs that are temporary.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.080]   That's what term life insurance is for.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:03.480]   And so for somebody in a family stage like yours, the vast majority or the entirety of
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.880]   your insurance need is temporary.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.360]   And so you should buy term life insurance.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.160]   And you always solve as an insurance agent, you always solve for death benefit needs with
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.760]   term life insurance because that's the cheapest solution now.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.920]   So let's say you go through an insurance analysis and you come out with that you have a need
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.480]   of $1.5 million of term life insurance.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.320]   Well, $1.5 million, how old are you James?
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   35.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.360]   $1.5 million of term life insurance for a healthy 35-year-old non-tobacco male is probably
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.560]   in the range of $50 to $70 a month, something like that, $50 to $60 a month.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.600]   So you can buy a million and a half dollars of insurance for $50 or $60 a month.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.540]   Not that big of a deal to sign up for, not going to break your budget, etc.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.880]   You go around and you try to buy $1.5 million of whole life insurance, it's going to cost
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   you 12 grand a year.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.120]   You can't afford that.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.680]   So you solve for your death benefit need for your family with term life insurance.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.440]   That's first and foremost.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.760]   Now over time, your insurance need should decline because every year that goes on, you
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.480]   now have more money, you've saved more money and your obligations, your financial obligations
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.480]   ideally will go down.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.220]   If you have one child and you don't have any more children, then you move to a situation
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:26.120]   where five years from now, there's five fewer years of living expenses that you need.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.800]   So you can drop your insurance at that point in time or as you save more money, if you
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.000]   needed $1.5 million of life insurance but your net worth increased by half a million
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.920]   dollars, then you're in a situation now where you can drop your insurance coverage
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.240]   from $1.5 million to $1 million.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.420]   And Dave Ramsey is a big proponent of the idea that you become self-insured.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:57.260]   The way that you become self-insured is by having enough money that your family would
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.380]   be okay if you didn't need insurance.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.700]   And there's nothing at all wrong with that.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.700]   Can it be done?
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700]   Absolutely.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.700]   It can be done.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:09.020]   Now, if you have a need for life insurance that is permanent, that will last for your
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:13.340]   entire life, then you need permanent life insurance.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.140]   You need life insurance that never goes away.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:20.380]   And what are some needs that would last for your entire lifetime?
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.560]   One example would be something like, I want to make sure that there's money available
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.500]   to bury me.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:31.940]   And so if you know you'd like to have money to pay for a funeral or for burial expenses,
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:37.500]   then a permanent life insurance policy that will pay out if you die at 36 or die at 96
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.780]   is nice to have.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:44.420]   Now what Dave would say if he were on this conversation is Dave would say, "Funerals
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:48.740]   don't cost that much and it should be easy for you if you've got a million dollars in
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:53.380]   IRA when you die, it should be easy for your family to come up with $20,000 for your funeral
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.380]   expenses."
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.740]   He's not wrong.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.500]   I think that's true.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:02.140]   But I've had some experience to show me that a lot of people don't necessarily always do
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.140]   that.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:07.220]   One experience, another example of something that would be nice to have insurance no matter
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.220]   when you die.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.780]   I had an experience with a client.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.820]   It wasn't a client that I originally sold insurance policies to.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:19.340]   It was a client that I picked up as a client of the company and I worked with them.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.820]   And the client's wife got sick and died.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:27.260]   And one of the things that really that I noticed that was new for me because I used to preach
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:32.700]   by term and vest the difference, the very hardest moral quandary that I had when thinking
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.920]   about going into the life insurance industry was could I ever sell whole life insurance.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.760]   When I was thinking about joining Northwestern Mutual, I interviewed with a couple of different
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   companies.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.000]   But I interviewed in the same week with Primerica, which is the current name for the company
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   started by A.L. Williams.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.420]   A.L. Williams built his career on by term and vest the difference that someone should
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.960]   only buy term life insurance.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.360]   And Primerica as a company only sells term life insurance based upon that philosophy.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.820]   A.L. Williams is like the ultimate expression of the by term and vest the difference.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:14.000]   For him it was a moral crusade of watching people be sold far too much whole life insurance
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.040]   and then die without having enough insurance.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:20.680]   And I acknowledge that I think that's happened in many cases and it's a great stain on the
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.600]   life insurance business.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   But then I interviewed the same week with Northwestern Mutual, which was one of the
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.800]   biggest sellers of whole life insurance of any company out there.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.600]   New York Life and Northwestern Mutual, Mass Mutual, Guardian, huge amounts of their business
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.360]   are made up in whole life insurance.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.840]   And I didn't know if I could ethically sell whole life insurance.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.600]   So I had that idea.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:50.600]   But these clients, I met with them fairly early in my career and it really, the details
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.680]   are fading a little bit at this point, but the clients were wealthy but they had spent
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   a lot of money on his wife's health care and they had spent a lot of money on their retirement
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.880]   and they had assets but those assets were tied up.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:10.800]   And I think it was a rental property, they had spent down their IRAs and they just didn't
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.480]   have a lot of money.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:19.560]   And so when the wife died, the life insurance payout, although it was only, I don't know,
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:26.040]   $150,000, $200,000, something like that, was such a blessing to the husband because he
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.880]   was totally cash poor.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.040]   He wasn't poor but he was cash poor.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.840]   And he was able to use the money to have a big funeral for his wife, which was important
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.220]   to him, and then he was able to use the money to see him through the time for him to go
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.080]   ahead and liquidate the real estate, move out of the big family house and move into
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.760]   a smaller place that would be good for him for an ongoing, for the rest of time.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.960]   And seeing the massive blessing of those whole life insurance policies changed me and it
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   made me realize that although I may have the best laid plans, that I'm going to have so
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.400]   much money and I'm always going to keep a liquid burial fund and make sure that I always
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.360]   have liquid assets because I'm going to be smarter than everyone else, I realized that
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.160]   it doesn't always work out like that.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.640]   So it would be another example of value of having a whole life insurance policy payout
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.280]   when you die as just simply liquidity.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.240]   And I would want to make sure if I die and I'm 90 years old, my wife is 90 years old,
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.520]   I would want to make sure that she had plenty of liquidity, that she didn't have to worry
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.400]   about money in the short term.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.040]   And there's nothing better than a life insurance payout for that.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.840]   What the life insurance company will often do, depends on every company, how they do
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:40.360]   death claims, but they'll send, if I died, they'd send my widow a checkbook.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:46.280]   And the checkbook has an account associated with whatever the amount of insurance was.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.640]   I have millions of dollars life insurance.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.440]   My wife immediately gets access to a checkbook with millions of dollars in it and she can
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440]   just write checks.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.840]   She can write a two and a half million dollar check to her personal checking account if
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   she wants, boom, all the money's there.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.000]   Or she can just write little checks to other people.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.800]   Now there are other interesting situations that you can get into.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.760]   Things like creditor disputes.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.320]   Let's say that somebody has money, but they're in the middle of a creditor dispute because
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.240]   Joshua did something stupid.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.760]   He went, or he created a big business.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.560]   This was going to be his last hurrah.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.480]   All of a sudden the business failed and now there's $15 million of claims outstanding.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.200]   And yeah, Joshua saved a couple million bucks when he was old, but now all of a sudden his
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.320]   assets are tied up.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.480]   Well, the life insurance policy can come in there.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.200]   Other scenarios when we get into more other areas of financial planning.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.400]   Things like buy-sell arrangements where let's say that I own a business with a business
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.080]   partner and our business is worth $2 million.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.840]   My share is a million dollars, but we want to make sure that if I die or my business
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.720]   partner dies, then we can buy each other out so that neither of us has to be in business
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.680]   with each other's widows.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.500]   And so we put in place a buy-sell arrangement and we can go ahead and fund that with a whole
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.320]   life insurance policy.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.840]   And then the nice thing about a whole life insurance policy when funding a buy-sell arrangement
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.600]   in a business is that we have a guaranteed death benefit at death, but then we also have
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.920]   cash value that accumulates over time.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.280]   And that cash value is segregated from the business assets and that cash value is very
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.280]   stable.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.840]   It grows slowly, but it grows guaranteed.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.960]   And then that cash value can be available as an asset to pull the money out and buy
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.720]   the business if one of us wants to retire and buy each other out at retirement or due
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.020]   to some whatever our buy-sell arrangement says.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.480]   And so the actual scenarios go on and on and on.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.280]   This is not the kind of financial planning that Dave frequently talks about.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.280]   This is not the kind of financial planning that's kind of entry-level, you know, 101
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   planning.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.120]   It's a little more complex, but those are some of the types of areas where whole life
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.960]   insurance really does shine.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   So those would just be examples.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.360]   Now, in your situation, probably none of that is necessary.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.360]   Always start, figure out your insurance need.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.120]   Begin before you ever buy life insurance, buy disability income insurance, far more
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.960]   important than life insurance.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.920]   Then buy term life insurance.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.880]   And if you have money left over, consider buying some small amount of whole life insurance
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.080]   if you want some.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:20.320]   Make sure that you're not funding your Roth IRA, not funding your 401(k) to buy whole
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.560]   life insurance.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.880]   Buying some small amount of whole life insurance, I'm happy for young people to do it as long
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.680]   as they have income and they can sustain the policies.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.600]   Now after those things are done, you got disability income insurance, you got lots of term life
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.160]   insurance, you're funding your qualified account.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.480]   If you still have money left over, now let's go to your investment plan.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.120]   And then that's where you can start looking at a cash value policy and say, "Does this
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.000]   fit as a component of the investment plan?"
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.440]   The answer is always, "It depends."
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.760]   What else are you going to invest in?
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.040]   What's the opportunity cost?
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:54.240]   Do you have things that are better, etc.?
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.920]   That's how I would approach your question.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.880]   For a young father, you need lots of term life insurance, lots and lots of it.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.160]   So just get that.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.560]   But get it with a company that you wouldn't mind converting your term life insurance over
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.000]   to a whole life insurance policy at some point in time as well.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.440]   >>Sam: Thank you so much.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.720]   I think I know where I'm going to seek out a local agent as well.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   I never did that.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.520]   I just always assumed that they were more expensive.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.040]   I've had biases against it.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.480]   So I'm happy to hear your input.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.920]   >>Dave: I will accept checks from all the life insurance agents who get business from
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920]   me.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.080]   Go ahead and you can just send Joshua a contribution.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   But it is true.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.040]   There's no difference in cost.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.600]   There's not.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.080]   And so on this one, for me, it's a big deal.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:47.160]   I see no reason whatsoever to, in today's marketplace, 10 years from now, something
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.080]   may change.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:54.960]   Because of the success of the no commission mutual fund industry, there have been companies
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.560]   that have been trying to sell no commission life insurance.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.520]   But in my current knowledge, if you find differently, email me and tell me that I'm wrong.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.640]   I'm happy to know that.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:12.840]   But in my current knowledge, none of those companies are really making a big difference.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.880]   And the reason is because life insurance still seems to be something that has to be sold
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.360]   by an agent.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.240]   Whereas people want to buy mutual funds, they want to fund their IRAs, et cetera.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.040]   And so the Vanguard revolution was more doable in the world of investments.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.720]   But the Vanguard revolution has not happened in life insurance.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.280]   Now if any listener can start the Vanguard revolution in life insurance and get people
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.400]   insurance at lower prices, great.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.760]   But it seems to be the case that most people need to be sold life insurance by somebody
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.480]   who's motivated to come out and sell it to them.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.720]   And so in order to get people to sell their products, insurance companies pay commissions.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.460]   And so the prices are the same, whether that commission is paid to an individual or paid
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:05.280]   to a guy running a website or advertising on TV, et cetera, or advertising on a radio
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.280]   show.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.420]   Zander Insurance I'm sure does a great job.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:14.180]   But at the end of the day, you don't get any discount by calling Zander versus calling
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.040]   your local life insurance agent.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:22.680]   Zander has to make up all of the costs of sponsoring Dave's program and sponsoring all
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.120]   of their advertising and all of their training, et cetera.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.080]   And so there's no savings to you.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.600]   All you know when you go to Zander is you're going to get a term insurance policy.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.580]   You're not going to get a whole life policy.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.100]   And so in my opinion, that's very short-sighted.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.680]   But for those who are deeply convicted of I'm only going to buy term and invest the
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   difference, fine.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.200]   It'll work as well as anything else.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.720]   James, I want to expand this.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   Thank you, Josh.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.200]   I'm going to give you one more lesson.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.240]   I want to explain to you how insurance underwriting works so that you can understand your options,
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:59.520]   especially as you're trying to work through your ratings or potential ratings.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:08.000]   When you go to a life insurance agent and you're talking to a life insurance agent and
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.880]   you say, "All right, life insurance agent, I want to buy a life insurance policy."
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.560]   The life insurance agent can put the policy in force on what's called a conditional basis.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:24.680]   And a life insurance contract, let's see if I can remember these fancy words, is a non-alleatory
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.240]   contract of adhesion.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.200]   I think I got that right of the technical words, which are meaningless to you.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:36.000]   But what it means is that in order for a life insurance contract to be fully in force, both
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.480]   you as the insured and the insurance company have to come to an agreement that you're both
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.760]   willing to accept the contract.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:49.480]   And so the way that that happens though is unique, where the insurance company, the insurance
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.640]   agent can bind the contract if certain things happen.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.760]   So you'll go to an insurance agent, the insurance agent will run quotes, they'll talk to you
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.440]   about different policy designs, things you can do, which by the way, James, go back in
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440]   the shows.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.440]   I've done some shows on this, but you should buy, at your age, you should buy a type of
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440]   insurance.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.520]   You should not buy a level term insurance policy in your 30s.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.240]   You should buy annual renewable term insurance, also called yearly renewable term insurance,
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.200]   because it's more flexible for the longterm and it's cheaper now.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.600]   When you get to your mid 40s and 50s, that's when you start buying level term insurance,
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.840]   but when you're younger than that, buy yearly renewable term insurance.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.720]   So you go to the insurance company agent, the insurance agent goes over some different
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720]   policy designs.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   You say, you go through some calculations to try to figure out how much insurance you
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.000]   want, how much you can afford, et cetera.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   And you come to an agreement.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.240]   You say, all right, insurance agent, I'd like to buy a million dollars of life insurance.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.520]   If you'll do three things, you can put the contract into force right away.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.960]   And those three things are a filled out, completed, signed application, an insurance application.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.760]   The second thing is a payment for the first month's premium.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.840]   And then the third thing is a medical exam or whatever medical underwriting requirements
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.800]   are required by the company.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.600]   Once those three things are done, where you've given payment for the contract, you've given
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.520]   a medical exam and you've filled out an application.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:16.240]   Once those three things are done, the insurance contract goes in force on a conditional basis.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:22.120]   What it means is basically the insurance company stops the clock from the time that those three
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.280]   things are done and then they go into underwriting.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.400]   So if you do those three things and then you die, you get in a car accident the next day
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:39.440]   and you die, unless your car accident was due to some fraud or something that you didn't
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:45.560]   disclose, it has to be materially connected to the cause of death, then the insurance
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.120]   company will still pay.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.480]   Now the underwriting process takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to months.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.440]   I had some that were six months of underwriting because of, okay, they got to get this doctor
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.880]   record here and your records are all over the place and they need this one, et cetera.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.000]   If you have a very simple medical history, it's fast.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.440]   If you have a complicated medical history, it takes a long time sometimes.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.800]   And so the insurance company will finally say, "All right, we're willing to issue the
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.440]   policy and here's what it is and we'll issue it at this rate."
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.920]   And so let's say you apply it at standard rates, but they charge you table two.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.560]   They'll send out the policy with table two rates on it and the insurance agent will get
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560]   it.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.520]   Then the insurance agent has to come and deliver it to you.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.520]   Now at the time of delivery, he'll go over any changed premium rates or any costs or
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.200]   anything associated with it.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.120]   And then he'll deliver the policy if you choose to accept it.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.020]   If you accept it, you have in most states what's called a two week free look period.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:45.360]   For any reason, two weeks after you accept the policy, then you can return it and you'll
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.760]   receive all your money back.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:54.220]   So it's basically a no risk application for you when you're going through this process.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.160]   So get with an insurance agent and go through some options, whatever they think you do is
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160]   the best.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.320]   Then go ahead and apply and bind the coverage so at least you've got the coverage started
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.200]   on that date.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.920]   Then if something happens during underwriting and you find out it's going to be expensive,
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.600]   the insurance agent will start looking around and will try to get some quotes from other
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.000]   companies.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.280]   And there are a couple methods the insurance agent will use.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.120]   Sometimes they'll submit what's called an informal inquiry, which means the insurance
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.540]   agent will have you fill out a form that just simply authorizes the agent to release your
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.400]   medical information to a number of different companies.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.880]   They'll send it right to the underwriters, the underwriters will look at your medical
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.800]   information and say, "Alright, well we like this, here's what we think we can do, of course
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.400]   we won't give a solid answer until we get an application, but here's what we think we
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   can do."
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.880]   And so they can collect quotes and do it that way.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.520]   Sometimes you'll go ahead and do multiple applications.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.440]   And so the insurance agent might bring you two or three other applications and say, "Alright,
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.480]   we're going to apply to company A, they rated you, so we're going to apply to C, F, and
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.480]   G over here and see if we can get a better offer there."
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:02.200]   Because you don't have to accept all of them, you just want to see what's the best rating.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:07.000]   So when you work with an agent as well, it's better for you because you can get coverage,
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.320]   at least on a temporary basis, through that process while they're working their way through
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:16.560]   trying to figure out how to get their best rates.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.400]   Are there bad life insurance agents out there?
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.160]   Of course there are.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.680]   Is there a seedy side to the industry?
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680]   Of course there is.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.960]   But I think that a lot of that stuff was really overplayed.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.720]   And most life insurance, what I've just, all this long speech, this is life insurance agent
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.720]   101.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.400]   You work with a guy who's been in the business for two months, he knows all this stuff, and
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.680]   he'll work your way through.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:44.280]   So get your insurance and there's a little bit of knowledge to get you started.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.240]   Thanks a ton, Joshua.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.880]   Hope that cough feels better.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:50.880]   Indeed.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.880]   Thank you very much.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.880]   All right.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.320]   I've got two written in questions from patrons that I'm going to answer here and then we
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.960]   will be done for today.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.480]   Oleg writes in and says, "Joshua, I won't be able to join the live Q&A, but I do have
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.400]   a question if you have time to answer it on the show.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.280]   What would you do with $300,000 in cash that you want preserved as a liquid asset for a
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:13.280]   possible future business opportunity, one month to three year horizon?
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.040]   High yield savings, 2%.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.920]   Vanguard prime money market, see the latter, 2 to 2.6%.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.320]   It may be acceptable to lose up to 10% of the cash if there's a good possibility for
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:28.020]   a much better return."
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.020]   This answer is very simple.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.520]   I'll make it fast.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.360]   I'm not aware of anything that would be acceptable under those parameters of potentially losing
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.520]   10% of the cash for a higher return.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.840]   Basically you need cash or a cash equivalent.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.480]   And so high yield savings, fine.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.880]   Vanguard prime money market, see the latter, fine.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.840]   I would just consider buying just straight T-bills.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.440]   $300,000, just go to straight, just buy straight T-bills.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:59.080]   Do it at, sometimes you can do it if you have a brokerage account somewhere, ask them.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:03.160]   Especially now that many of the big companies have eliminated commissions, you can just
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.480]   simply fund a T-bill account and buy T-bills directly through your brokerage or go to Treasury
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.240]   Direct and set up an account there and just buy T-bills.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.940]   T-bills are the gold standard.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.940]   That's what I would do.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.460]   I wouldn't take any risk with it if there was a possible future business opportunity.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.020]   I think it'd be silly to try to chase half a percent.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.380]   I mean, what are we talking about?
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.380]   Let's do some math here.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:30.780]   So $300,000, let's say we're chasing 50 basis points, half a percent, $1,500, a bunch of
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:35.500]   shenanigans going here, going there to try to get an extra $1,500 over a year.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:40.380]   When you're talking about a one month, a three year horizon on $300,000, if it's a three
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:48.780]   year horizon and we're trying to get an extra 50 basis points, we're talking an extra $4,500.
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.180]   If it's a three year horizon, maybe there's something better, but if it's truly one month
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.660]   of three years, I wouldn't take the risk of losing my business deal for that.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:01.300]   So I would put it straight into T-bills.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:06.220]   Kevin asks, "Joshua, my question is in the realm of total returns versus dividends, but
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.580]   not on which one is best, etc.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:14.140]   Another investing podcast interviews many folks from the world of high finance.
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:19.020]   It's abundantly clear these folks look down upon the plebes who like dividends.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:23.580]   One in particular was the founder of Morningstar who didn't use the words, although his tone
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.540]   was crystal clear.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:31.660]   Is this dislike of dividends taught in advanced finance schools like the CFA or CFP?
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.380]   Am I missing something glaringly obvious?
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.380]   Any fool can know.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.500]   The point is to understand."
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   Albert Einstein quote.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:42.140]   "Please help me understand."
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:55.620]   I guess, so most of the time, I want to get this right, so let me be careful with my words.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:08.580]   Many people who are basic, simple people do see dividends as different than total return.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:13.220]   And for anybody who's unfamiliar with these words, basically the idea is companies are
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:17.540]   supposed to make profits and then the idea is they pay those profits out to their shareholders
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.500]   as a dividend.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:23.540]   So you can look at the dividend rate of a stock or you can build a stock portfolio,
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.740]   a dividend portfolio that you're going to live on the dividends, which means you never
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:29.620]   share, you never sell any of your shares.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:34.940]   You just simply spend the dividends that are sent to you in the form of a quarterly check.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:42.140]   Total return means, well, if you want $1,000, you can get $1,000 based upon $1,000 of dividends,
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:47.140]   but you can also get $1,000 simply based upon the stock price going up and then you sell
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.860]   a share or a few shares in order to take $1,000.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:56.340]   That's the same $1,000 in your pocket, the same $1,000 in your pocket.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:00.780]   So when you look at total returns, usually it's a combination of those things.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.780]   And it's interesting when you look at the companies that pay dividends versus the companies
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.380]   that pay total returns.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:10.860]   And so I think most people who haven't thought it through, who haven't worked it through
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:15.620]   probably do tend to think that dividends are simpler because they like the idea of not
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.860]   selling their assets.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.380]   Now it's my opinion that actually planning a dividend only financial plan is a really
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.380]   powerful plan.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.820]   It's a really powerful mental structuring of your affairs that you never want to spend
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.820]   principal.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:31.940]   You only want to spend profits and that's really easy to do with dividends.
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:35.820]   It's one of the reasons why I like real estate so much.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:41.580]   If an investor buys some rental houses and you tell them you can live on your rents,
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.740]   but you can only live on the rents and you can't put mortgages on these properties, you
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.980]   have to have them paid off, you now have a built-in budget that somebody can follow and
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.260]   they can budget their affairs and you know they will never be broke because they only
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:55.260]   are living on income.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.060]   They'll never spend the capital, never spend the principal.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.760]   I think that's really powerful.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.420]   The problem comes into stocks because when you look at returns, some of your best performing
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.260]   companies often don't pay dividends.
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:09.440]   And I think there's a really good argument for that perspective.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.620]   Why would I want a company to pay me a dividend right now if they can reinvest that money
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:16.260]   into growing their business?
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:20.020]   I'm investing in the company because I want them to grow the business, so why should they
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.660]   send me shares of the profit when they can grow the business?
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.140]   I think that's a good argument.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:29.680]   I think there's also a good counter-argument though that dividends represent actual profits.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.780]   And there seem to be a lot of companies who are so good at chasing growing business that
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.660]   they never get around to making all that much money.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:41.560]   I worry about this with some of the companies that are very prominent in the US stock market
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.700]   right now.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.100]   And I wonder, is this a scam?
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.940]   These companies that just seem to get bigger and bigger and don't actually make very much
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:52.980]   money, they're not proving that they're actually profitable and yet the share price keeps going
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.340]   up and people keep buying it?
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.820]   That was something that was at the core of the dot-com bubble and the dot-com burst was
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:02.520]   simply that everybody said, "We're going to get huge selling pet food online and selling
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.980]   all this stuff," but the companies didn't make any profits.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:08.000]   But the stock prices got pumped up, pumped up, pumped up, pumped up because there was
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.320]   demand for them.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.140]   And so it looked like everything was working but they weren't actually profitable.
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.900]   So there's a balance there that's correct.
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:23.820]   I'm not aware of anything being taught in CFA or CFP.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:27.200]   There's nothing that's explicitly taught that would account for that.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:35.500]   If your analysis is true, if you hear this nose turned up high-mindedness among high-finance
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:42.980]   professionals, if that's true, my reason as to why it's true is this.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:46.300]   The companies that pay dividends are boring.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.940]   They're in boring businesses.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.700]   They're old, they're developed, and they're boring.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:55.220]   And the companies that generate profits via total return with increasing stock prices
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.220]   are exciting.
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:02.380]   They're new, they're growing like crazy, and they have tremendous opportunity in the future.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:05.860]   Now, again, I'm not sure your assessment is true.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:08.080]   If it is true, though, that's why it is.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.140]   It's a whole lot more fun to think about Tesla or Apple or Amazon, these companies of the
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:19.020]   future that are growing like crazy, have these huge increases, et cetera.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:28.300]   This is exciting world of finance versus boring old utility company, boring old Coca-Cola,
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:29.300]   things like that.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:35.860]   So that same interest that people have, if there's one stock that probably more people
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:37.260]   have, it's some company like Apple.
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.500]   You feel like, "Hey, this is great.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.740]   It's a great business."
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:45.580]   I was stunned to see somebody did a write-up on the Apple AirPod business.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.540]   And I don't pay much attention to that world, but I was just stunned.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:53.100]   They were talking about how revolutionary a technology as simple as the Apple AirPod,
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.820]   the wireless earbuds that Apple came out with.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:03.980]   And they said if that business alone, just the revenue from that business were its own
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:08.520]   standalone company, it would be the 19th largest company on the US stock market.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.820]   That's how revolutionary that is.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:18.380]   And I've often been disdainful of Apple in the past, but man, my respect is increasing
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:21.540]   because what they seem to be really good at doing is taking these things that seem very
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.860]   simple and making a bazillion dollars off of them and doing it in a very reliable way.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   I'm listening to the biography of Steve Jobs right now, the Walter Isaacson biography,
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.860]   and I've just been so interested in thinking about it.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.860]   It's pretty remarkable.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.300]   So that's my best guess.
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.340]   If any listeners have a better guess, then come on by and tell me.
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:45.820]   It's an interesting question.
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:50.940]   But for practical purposes, I'm convinced the total return argument is the way to go.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:56.740]   But yet for planning purposes, I can't get away from loving just spending profits, just
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.020]   spending dividends.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:02.380]   And I'm not financially independent to the point where I can just live on the income
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.380]   from my portfolio.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:09.260]   But I'll tell you what, as much as I like to pride myself on being a clear thinker and
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:15.380]   saying, "Oh, I'm not going to make things emotionally," I find the dividend story really
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.380]   compelling.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:17.380]   I really do.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:21.460]   I find it really compelling.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.420]   Just the idea of just living on dividends.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:25.460]   Now tax efficiency is the other thing.
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.180]   Dividends are not tax efficient, whereas gains are.
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:31.540]   So we can tell a lot of stories to complex discussion, and I think the key is to come
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:33.020]   down on an individual.
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:38.360]   But I love the simplicity of you can't outspend your principal.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.300]   You just live on your income.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.940]   That to me is a lesson that we all can use today.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:53.140]   I can guarantee you this, if you were to ask my wife that question, she would much rather
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.220]   be a dividend investor.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:58.900]   My wife looks at stocks as basically fake money.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:04.180]   It doesn't actually exist unless it's creating income.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.740]   And she's not stupid.
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:08.780]   It's her way of looking at it.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.780]   And I like that.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.360]   It makes sense to me.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.660]   And so if you gave her the choice of saying, "How would you like to figure out your budget?
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.380]   Would you like to use this sophisticated analysis that's taking into account total market return,
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:25.340]   selling some shares over here, taking some dividends as income, and then some shares
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.700]   over here as income?
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.380]   Or would you like to just have enough money that you can just live on the dividends, knowing
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:35.420]   that that way you can totally ignore the share prices and just ignore them and live on the
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.420]   income?"
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:37.980]   I'll have to ask her that.
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:39.780]   When I get finished recording this show, I'll ask her.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:43.140]   But my bet is she'll take the income.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:46.260]   It's hard for people to make that transition of going from living on an income their whole
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:51.980]   life to spending money and then trying to figure out how to be confident that the money's
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.340]   going to last for the rest of their life.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:59.460]   When somebody is an accumulator and a saver to all of a sudden now be a deaccumulator
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.840]   and a spender, that can be difficult.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.220]   And so if it helps someone to feel more comfortable just living on dividends, I'm not going to
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.220]   fight it.
