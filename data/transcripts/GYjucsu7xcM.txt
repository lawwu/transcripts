[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   >> All right, good afternoon. We've had a tremendous day already and looking forward
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   to what the Lord has in store for us the rest of this afternoon and evening. I want to welcome
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.840]   you to our Q&A with our keynote speakers. My name is Mark Tatlock. I serve here at Grace
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.440]   Church with the ministry of the Master's Academy International. It's my joy to facilitate our
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.280]   discussion today. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I do have
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.240]   an announcement. It's a very practical announcement. One of our brothers, one of our international
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.640]   attendees who's with us, someone picked up his backpack by mistake. Now, that may not
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600]   be a great concern, a backpack, but this one has his passport and all of his other paperwork
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.760]   in it, so we need you to check that you have your backpack and not this brother's. If you
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   find it, take it to the concierge desk, and they'll work to exchange that for you, and
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.040]   we'll make sure that brother finds his way home safely, okay? All right, thank you for
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.280]   that. Well, our theme of proclaiming Christ to the nations, I think we all feel honored
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.480]   that this is what our focus is this week. I know it is a conviction and a passion of
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.640]   your men to see the church faithful in the participation of the Great Commission, and
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.920]   you've already benefited us greatly through your preaching ministry. As we talk today,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.800]   I want to go back to the theme that we heard so clearly yesterday on the love of Christ
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   being the motive for missions. I think we all recognize we live in a day and age where
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.000]   the motive for missions often comes across to people in the pew as one of duty, implying
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.120]   almost a sense of guilt or responsibility there, or we're taught all kinds of pragmatic
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.080]   methods and things like that, but we're trying to get to the heart of what really drives
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.440]   the Great Commission. So in the discussion of the love of Christ as being the motive,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.480]   it made me think of Ephesians chapter 3 and Paul's prayer there, beginning in verse 9,
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.760]   speaking of the love of Christ, which is beyond comprehension, but his prayer is that God
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.200]   would strengthen us to comprehend and to know the love of Christ, and the context of that
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.000]   is his call to ministry to proclaim the mystery of Christ to the Gentiles.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.760]   So I wanted to ask you the question and consider, in your own life, growing in your love for
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.880]   Christ, how has that really become a pursuit in your own life in ministry, and what encouragement
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   would you give to these ministers in that regard? And if it's okay, Joel, I'm going
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.000]   to start with you. I want to ask you, as our resident expert on the Puritans, which of
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   the Puritans do you feel really just has such a strong emphasis in their own preaching and
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.400]   writing ministry, and that you might make some recommendations to us and what you've
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.960]   learned from your study of them?
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:16.520]   Okay. Puritans were, of course, very mission minded. I have a sectional tomorrow talking
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   about that, and they didn't write so many books on exactly how to do missions, but they
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.040]   lived a missional life, and they believed that every minister should be an evangelist.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:46.120]   So some of them wrote great evangelistic tracts. Their tract was not 250 words long. It was
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.700]   not, even like Paul Washer's wonderful Gospel of Jesus Christ, 25 pages long, but they were
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:01.280]   like 150 pages long. Joseph Align, "Alarm to the Unconverted," Richard Baxter, "Call
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.680]   to the Unconverted," were both used for thousands and thousands of conversions. And I think
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.640]   what I learned from the Puritans, most of all, about evangelism and missions is how
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:26.760]   far short I come, for one thing, but also that that whole idea, which my dad also inbred
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:35.520]   in me as a child, is that your whole life is to be missional. So every conversation
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.660]   you engage in, every person you meet, the goal is to have, say something, say something
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.420]   that leaves behind a good word for the Lord, say something that makes Christ attractive,
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.480]   and try to get an opportunity to pray with people. That's a really big thing in my life.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.560]   I always teach my theological students that praying with people is the most important
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.380]   thing you can do when you pour out your heart for their spiritual welfare, whether they're
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.160]   believer or unbeliever. And that's very meaningful. That's doing mission work in intimacy with
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:26.800]   God as you draw them in. So I've had a principle in my study of all the visitors. If anyone
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.920]   wants to talk to me about something more than one or two minutes, I'll say, "Sit down.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.560]   We're going to pray first." And I say, "You pray at the beginning. I'll pray at the end."
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.820]   And I want to not just bookend everything with prayer, but to me prayer is of the essence
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.300]   of doing missions, because we can't convert anyone. And I think the Puritans would say
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:53.880]   the same thing. Thomas Watson, for example, says, "We proclaim Christ, but it's the Holy
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:02.100]   Spirit that takes the key of preaching and unlocks the heart of man, which we cannot
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.620]   do." So I think the passion for souls comes when we understand, as we've been hearing
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.180]   all conference long, what a wonder it is that we are saved. And it's like those men, I forget,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.940]   from Samaria or whatever, who went out and, you know, the enemy was completely gone and
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.380]   they found all these spoils and they started feasting, gorging themselves. And then they
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.500]   said, "Wait a minute. We can't feast on all these things and not go back and tell Israel
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.540]   that the enemy is defeated." And that's what we need to do with our lives. We just need
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.220]   to...if we really believe that we have the one truth that the whole world needs, we got
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.900]   to share it with the whole world as much as possible. So that's why I get up every morning
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.780]   and one of my secret prayers every morning is, "Lord, help me to be in connection with
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.100]   someone today that needs to hear the gospel. Open some door with someone somewhere." So
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:08.260]   living with that consciousness that every conversation is an opportunity to speak a
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.980]   good word for the Lord. That's what I learned from my dad even more than the Puritans. My
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.620]   dad was an elder for 40 years and he would...if you just watch him walk out after church,
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.500]   you know, on the parking lot, he'd stop by the little boys and girls and say, "What did
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.300]   you learn from the sermon today?" Or if a six-year-old was walking by him, he'd stop
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.580]   him and say, "Do you know how important it is to hate sin and love the Lord Jesus Christ?"
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:43.460]   So and for example, when you greet people at the door as a pastor, do you pay attention
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.460]   to the little children? Do you say something meaningful to them? Or do you say like, "I've
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.960]   got a sermon today that's a story and you can listen to it and you can talk with your
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.540]   dad about it later, but I've got something to say to you too today." And the kid looks
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.820]   at you like, "Oh, wow." And they'll listen better. So I mean, there's just a thousand
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:13.500]   ways. It's a way of life. You don't let opportunities go by and you ask the Lord for more opportunities
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:19.020]   every day to speak a good word for the Lord. Bring the gospel, death in Adam, life in Christ,
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.620]   wherever you go.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:29.120]   Thank you. Paul, I'll stay with that same theme and direct it to you. I know in your
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.600]   missionary career in Peru, you've been threatened at gunpoint, but I've also heard you speak
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.560]   of just the humblest, most faithful village pastors and those who are itinerant men going
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.000]   from village to village sharing Christ in very difficult circumstances facing many trials.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.540]   Can you speak to how the love of Christ frees a man to face those kinds of risks and hardship
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.440]   in missionary service?
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:09.200]   For me, there are two different aspects. One is the love of a regenerate soul for the lost.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.600]   That will be there and it should be powerful. But when you're out there preaching, usually
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.360]   what happens is people gather around you. They listen for a while. Then all of a sudden
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:29.600]   someone sent by the enemy starts screaming out heretic or this or that. And they take
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:40.160]   your little pulpit and your tracks and you and throw you out in the street. Or like they
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.880]   did two of my brothers while they preached in the plaza, just continued to pour goat
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   urine on their heads and beat them with canes. It takes more than love for men at that point
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:02.800]   to keep you preaching. And you would expect me to say now a love for Christ. And that
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:09.600]   is true. But I find my own love for Christ to be so fickle and unstable. And I believe
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.360]   that the genitive there in 1 Corinthians 5 when Paul talks about the love of Christ controls
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:29.760]   us that it's not his love for Christ but Christ's love for him. That's the one in my very broken
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:40.920]   weak life. That is the iron foundation for him. You know, I can tell you how many times
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.400]   we jump in the back of a cattle truck or whatever and hide and go up into the mountains and
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:57.680]   look at my brothers. For him. For him. And you know, men seek for courage. And I don't
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:07.560]   think that's wise because courage also can turn into pride. To delve into how much Christ
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:18.640]   loves you and how beautiful that love. The older I get, I realize that it's that unconditional
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:26.840]   ongoing continuous love of Christ that will drive a man more severely than any whip of
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:35.720]   the law. But what you've got to understand, I'm speaking not just in propositional truth,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   but I'm speaking experimentally, as the old man would say, and that is born out of prayer.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.600]   In prayer, the beauty of Christ can become such a reality that that you have to say,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:00.240]   Lord, take your hand off me, lest I perish. To know him as a person, to seek him, to have
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.360]   a tryst with him. As I've been saying many times now that I travel, I'm seeing so many
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.840]   young men that I'm seeing so often before men that I wonder if they have enough time
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:23.360]   to be before Christ in prayer. My life, I've never. If there's anything in my life that's
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:36.240]   been out of any worth, it's. Anyone can pray anyone. Everyone's weak enough. To Terry.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.380]   To come out of bed at night when he calls your name. And it's that that drives even
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:49.760]   the weakest man to do things that seem to be courageous. The love of Christ.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:57.640]   After, do you have any thoughts on that in your own life and ministry?
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:09.480]   What these men have said is so wise, insightful. I think from a different angle. As you study
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:23.460]   the word, there has to be a discipline. That truth. And you love the Lord more because
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:32.780]   of that truth. I think often we treat or we are tempted to treat the preparation for preaching
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:41.560]   or teaching like an assignment. You just have to get it done. And so we can intellectually
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:53.100]   finish the job. But if that's all we've done, we failed. And there is the need. It's even
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.740]   Ezra 710 that he not only studied, but then he did and then he preached and he taught.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:07.540]   That's what we have to do. We cannot leave any doctrine, any verse, any word until we
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:18.100]   love it and love him more for it. And then, then the love of Christ that he has for you,
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.620]   like our brother Paul mentioned from 2 Corinthians 5, will compel us.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.660]   Tremendous. Do you add anything, brother?
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:35.700]   Yeah. I think first of all, the point that's been made about the love of Christ in terms
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:42.940]   of Christ's love for us, I think is a vital point because it is out of that love that
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:52.980]   our own love is ignited. Paul's statement in the famous Galatians 2.20 about the fact
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:59.020]   that the life he lives, he lives by faith in the Son of God, and then he adds that phrase,
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:12.340]   "who loved me and gave himself for me." It looks like that was the furnace from which
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:21.820]   a lot of his energy for ministry was being derived. "Who loved me and gave himself
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:31.980]   for me." It is said of the missionary, David Livingstone, that on one occasion he made
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   his way back to England. His arm was in a sling because a lion had jumped on him after
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:49.260]   he had already shot it and was pulling him apart, or trying to do so, tearing away at
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.820]   him. But because he was losing blood, it finally just collapsed in front of him and died.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:00.740]   But anyway, so he made his way to England, and he had his arm in a sling, and somebody
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:13.700]   asked him the question about the sacrifice that he is giving to the cause of missions,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:26.180]   and his answer was classic. He said, "Sacrifice? Sacrifice? No one should use that word about
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:34.940]   himself in the light of the sacrifice of God's own Son."
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:41.100]   And I think really that's the addition that I'd like to make to that.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.180]   Tremendous. Thank you.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.260]   Just turning to another subject that we have to consider, many of us have had conversations
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:58.300]   about the emphasis on the social sciences in the field of missions, missiology, and
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.220]   the desperate need for a return to the authority of Scripture in the missions endeavor. And,
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.500]   Abner, I'm going to start with you. In the new missions textbook, Biblical Missions,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.660]   your chapter is the first chapter, and it's entitled Fidelity to the Word of God in Missions,
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:21.700]   Scripture as the Launch, Life, and Legacy of the First Missionaries. Can you unpack
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.400]   for us the highlights of your argument for a return to the authority of Scripture in
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   missions?
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.200]   Yeah, I think the way you could put it as simply as this way, who's defining, who gets
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:41.400]   to define mission? If the world or society or an academic discipline defines mission,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:48.680]   it's no longer the mission of God. God's mission means He owns it. God's mission means
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:56.600]   He defines it. God's mission means He commissioned it. That's what it means of God's mission,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:05.160]   Christ's commission. And so, because God defines it, He defines it in His Word. And there were
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:13.480]   the first, shall we say, missionaries. They were the apostles. They were the first missionaries.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.680]   They were the ones who held the Scripture high. They were the ones who set the pattern.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:28.280]   And all of the other stuff that now has hijacked the missiological world, that is a foreign
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:36.080]   entity that has intruded into the biblical purity that has been set forth not by man,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.400]   but by God. And so, we need to go back to what the Scriptures have established if we
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.880]   are to do the mission. Now, if you're not here to do the mission of Christ, well, get
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:57.160]   out. No, in all seriousness, if you're not here to do the mission of Christ, then yeah,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.520]   all of those other sociological things, of course they make sense to people. But if you're
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.720]   actually here to do the work of the ministry and to take and preach Christ to the ends
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:15.080]   of the earth, then there is the one who gave us the mission defines it. And we do not have
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.440]   the right to define it on our own terms.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.200]   - Excellent. Thank you. Conrad, I'm sure in your context, you've seen the outworking of
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.040]   those influences in missiology. Would you just share maybe your observations and comments?
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:41.400]   - Yeah, well, perhaps let me begin with a very brief story. Towards the end of 1999
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:49.360]   and beginning of the year 2000, I got a phone call from somebody I didn't know. And he said
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:20:03.080]   on the other side, "Hello, my name is Paul Washer." And the short of that conversation
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:11.520]   was that he wanted to partner with us in our mission's work. It was out of fear for exactly
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:21.080]   what Abner just said here, that we took a bit of time. I think Paul thought it was a
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:28.200]   very long time, but we took a bit of time to come up with a mission's policy, which
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:38.320]   was dipped in Scripture from beginning to end. And then we gave it to him and said,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:46.920]   "Are you willing to sign this before we can work together?" Do you remember, Paul? Yeah.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:55.520]   And it was because we knew that the Western world had all kinds of views about missions.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:02.800]   We did not want to hold hands in the darkness. And we've worked now together for about 25
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:13.420]   years in the work of missions because we are working on the foundation of Scripture. And
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:22.480]   as has just been said, you have the founder of the church laying the foundation in the
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:28.640]   Gospels. You have the book of Acts giving you something of the initial outworking. You've
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:35.360]   got the Gospels wrestling with the issues that were coming up in the context of these
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:42.880]   churches. And it was about churches being established, places where the Gospel would
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.720]   go forth, God's people would be nurtured, watched after, and so on.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:58.400]   Yeah, I can't imagine why we should now be looking for tricks to achieve what God Himself
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:04.360]   has given a manual for us to use. Thank you.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:12.400]   It's likely the case a lot of North American pastors aren't aware of really what's happening
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.920]   as a result of those influences and missions and missions training over the years. And
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.520]   it'd be helpful if maybe Paul and Joel, if you have observations about that, could just
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.720]   comment on the need for pastors to be informed so that they can shepherd their people in
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.160]   this regard.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.520]   For years there have been what, it's almost like a Gnosticism. It's an esoteric missionary
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.960]   knowledge that has been invented, and I believe it's been invented by men who did not have
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:52.400]   the Scriptures nor the Spirit of God. And it is rank. How do you plant a church in the
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:23:01.960]   most exotic people group in the world the same way you plant a church in Kansas? You
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:12.280]   preach the Scriptures, you obey the Scriptures, you pray, and you live with piety, with virtue.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.040]   There is no secret key. There's not all this stuff. Another thing you've got to realize
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.080]   is just look for a moment at what we supposedly believe about the radical depravity of the
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:28.640]   human heart. It is like Jericho. It is tightly shut up. No one comes out. No one comes in.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.680]   There's nothing that's going to break into that heart but the Holy Spirit through the
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.120]   preaching of the gospel. Then look at our enemy. You wrestle not with flesh and blood.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:45.680]   We wrestle with powers and principalities and mites and dominions. All your little strategies
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:54.720]   are nothing. The only way we can overcome is to submit ourselves entirely to the Scriptures.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.320]   Paul told Timothy, "In case I delay, I write so that one may know how to conduct himself
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.520]   in the household of God." How do you know how to conduct yourself in the household of
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:10.200]   God? Only through what is written. And the men who lash themselves down to Scripture,
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:16.840]   the men who throw away Saul's armor and take up the smooth stones of the gospel, they're
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.480]   the men that are going to plant churches. Another thing about missions that you have
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:27.080]   to understand. Missions is just one biblical church sending out a like-minded, elder-qualified
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:35.400]   man to plant another biblical church. That's what it is. For example, if Conrad, we've
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.120]   known each other for years. I know of his elders. I know the decisions they've made.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:48.880]   All these things. So if Conrad calls me tomorrow, or the church in Leon, it's one of your churches.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.560]   If they call us tomorrow, those elders, and say, "We have four graduates. They're elder-qualified
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.320]   and they're ready to go out." We don't even have to investigate. Why? Because they're
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.840]   being sent out by biblical local churches with biblical elders who will make sure they're
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:13.200]   elder-qualified and pull them off the field if they're not. Missions is extraordinarily
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:19.040]   difficult, but it's not complex. It's not complex at all.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:26.280]   I want to press into this a little bit more. One of the other things that we've seen with
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.960]   regard to contemporary missions has been the loss of the local church as central to the
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.680]   missions enterprise. I'd just like to hear your thoughts. How did we lose sight of this?
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:45.400]   And what is the role of the pastor in leading the mission strategy or effort of his church?
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:53.000]   Just real quickly, look at the book of Acts. It's quite amazing. Someone smarter than me
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.720]   ought to do a study on this. You start off, and it's apostles, apostles, apostles, and
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:05.360]   then apostles, elders, apostles, elders. By the time you get to Acts 15, what do you see?
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:14.040]   You see elders. Because they should have their finger on the pulse of what's going on in
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.440]   the world. They should be the ones. 2 Timothy 2.2, you can use seminaries, and they can
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:26.160]   be a tremendous blessing, but ultimately, 2 Timothy 2.2, that's part of the elder's
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:33.000]   job to oversee that those young men are elder qualified and that they're able and qualified
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.320]   to send them out. There is no mission apart from the local church. There is none.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:48.680]   Perhaps the only addition that I'd like to make there is to answer the question, why
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:59.120]   has the local church been replaced by other institutions? I think part of it, especially
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:07.960]   where I'm coming from, that is, in the context of Africa, is the fact that you rightly had
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:15.520]   missionaries coming, evangelizing, and helping, in that sense, churches to be established.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:30.680]   And then, as they began to train evangelists and other pastors, instead of allowing these
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:42.600]   young churches, with their elders, to then send these individuals, they, as the missionaries,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:50.280]   institutional missionaries, remained in charge of the process. So they are the ones who are
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:57.320]   now sending their graduates all over the place to establish churches. I suppose it helps
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:04.560]   with their reports back to where they were sent from, that we've now done this, we're
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.880]   sending more of this, we're planting more churches. But in the process, they are sending
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:19.960]   a message to the indigenous churches that this is not your business. And we lost a lot
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   of ground, and it's been quite difficult to reverse the process so that the churches can
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:38.640]   take their place as the ones that are to identify individuals, nurture them, ensure that they
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:46.660]   are properly trained, commission them, watch over them, support them, counsel them, and
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:54.480]   all that happens in the process of maturing church plants. So I would give that as a historical
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:01.080]   way in which the churches, especially in the mission field, lost the place, the biblical
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   place.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.160]   I'd like to supplement that. That is so insightful. Thank you, because that helps, I think, us
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.520]   think through missions better. I think in the West, with the high degree of individualism
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:23.020]   that has pervaded our culture, what has, and let's be charitable, inadvertently happened
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:33.640]   is a low, low view of the church, has infiltrated, ironically, the church. And so when somebody
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:39.040]   says, with the best of intentions, "I want to go overseas. I want to do something for
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.520]   the Lord," we just say, "Great, go," and we send them. And we never instruct them that
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:53.760]   you do know that ministry happens in the body of Christ. You do know that ministry is part
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.440]   and parcel of the work of the church. You can't just go by yourself in that way, be
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.120]   completely lone ranger, independent in that way.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:12.200]   We have not instructed, perhaps, our churches well in understanding the value and the institution
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:19.960]   that Christ Himself established for this age that is the church. And as a result, then
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:25.360]   the missions that we have engaged in has separated from the church. But as you all have mentioned,
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.680]   you can't have that apart from the church. And so we've actually dismembered our own
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.640]   mission in that regard.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:40.320]   Yeah, so the low view of church here, and yet the fervor of a young missions movement
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.480]   in our generation has resulted in a lot of young people being sent out who aren't committed
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.920]   to the church overseas. So a lot of work being done in the name of missions that is not focused
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   on the church itself. And you've helped us appreciate that. Thank you very much.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.680]   Let me ask this question, three of you here, a chancellor and two presidents of Bible colleges
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.880]   and seminaries. I'd like you to share your perspective on how do you inspire and equip
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.320]   your students to engage in evangelism and missions, not just when they're sent out,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.120]   but in their own lives as students?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:34.800]   So we, obviously we have our seminary in Grand Rapids, and we're training about 500 students
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:41.480]   right now from 40 some countries around the world. And a lot of them are embedded in their
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:52.540]   own culture, and we have connections of oversight and work with all these 28 different seminaries.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:58.280]   But in terms of our own students and our own denomination, and in our own seminary in Grand
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:08.200]   Rapids, there's a number of things that we do. First of all, Dr. Brian DeVries, who just
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:14.720]   published his first book, which is published by Crossway, which has done really well, he's
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:21.840]   the president of McConnell Theological College in South Africa. And he's established a mission
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:28.640]   network over there in which they're training about 1,500 men for the ministry all around
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:37.560]   Africa by getting other ministers to shepherd a group of men around himself and around the
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:43.440]   elders, maybe five or 10 men. And they take courses long distance, they do internships,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.800]   three-year internships with the minister and so on. He just came out with his first book
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:57.380]   called You Will Be My Witnesses. It's birthed out of Acts 1, verse 8, and it looks at the
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:05.720]   whole concept of missions being rooted in the word martyrdom, sacrificing for the gospel's
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:12.040]   sake. Christian witness as gospel presence, Christian witness as gospel message, by gospel
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:21.000]   response, by gospel community. So Brian, Dr. DeVries, got his MDiv and THM at our seminary,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.280]   then went to Southern for his PhD, and he's been immersed in missions now for about 20
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:32.760]   years. He comes back, actually, and teaches our five mission courses in our seminary,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:40.280]   and does very well. But then we also have other men come in and do a variety of things.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:46.680]   For one thing, a couple very solid, reformed, biblical street preachers come to our seminary
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:54.400]   every year. They take all the students out and do street preaching in Grand Rapids. Every
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:01.840]   student is also connected with a local minister, and that minister is his overseer who reports
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:10.040]   to our two spiritual deans, and they talk about missions in that own local church, and
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.180]   the goal is that the student is involved in at least one mission work in the local church
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.640]   over which that minister oversees the work, and then gives us regular reports on how the
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:29.200]   student is doing. And so that local minister will then take the student to homeless shelters,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.640]   he'll take him to nursing homes, he'll take him to different places to do mission work,
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:40.760]   jails, prisons in the community, and the student gets the experience of speaking in a number
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:46.960]   of different venues and goes with the pastor, the local pastor, who we only take pastors
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.840]   we really trust, are biblical, and have a heart for missions, and he takes him out on
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.320]   various mission endeavors. And so we kind of cobbled together a program by getting a
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:07.000]   lot of people to help us among the elderships of churches and ministers and local churches,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.760]   as well as in-house training.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.080]   Thank you. And so you're intentional in that, making sure that's part of the experience
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.720]   of the preparation.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:26.040]   Yeah, well, from our end, a number of our students are actually pastors, even now, so
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:35.520]   that they are immediately applying as they are learning. We are on the starting end of
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:46.320]   our master's program, our sort of seminary end of the university. And so I think for
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:56.160]   us at the moment, it's just making sure that as we begin to grow, we don't lose the aspect
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:03.760]   of the practical side of ministry, so that we don't just have people getting their degree
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:11.660]   qualifications through written assignments and class discussions, but that we ensure
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:20.920]   that even those who are not in actual ministry are very involved in their local churches,
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:28.160]   because it is really through that, that under their elders and pastors, they will then gain
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.800]   the experience as they are then sent out elsewhere. But we're really at the beginning.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:44.360]   Yeah, I think they're so helpful, because I'm new, so I'm just learning from them. But
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:52.420]   I think in addition to the practical side, which is putting into action the activity
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:37:00.140]   of evangelism, the love for that can only be gained as you do it. And I remember as
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:06.540]   a freshman in college, an older student taking me under his wing and saying, "We're going
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.460]   to go to Third Street, Santa Monica, and we're going to do open-air evangelism." And I said,
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.220]   "I don't even know where that is. I don't even know what any of that means." And he
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.740]   just said, "I'll buy you a hamburger." I said, "Okay, that's all I need." And then we just
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:34.940]   did it. But that's what allowed me to understand what that was and to love it. And so it is
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.700]   older taking younger. It is providing those opportunities to get people's feet wet so
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:49.300]   that they love what they never knew they could love, and to not be scared, to not be intimidated
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:56.460]   by it, to think that the Lord can use me this way. And you know what? Getting shamed in
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:03.900]   public is not bad for the Lord Jesus. I'm no longer scared. I love the practical aspect
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:12.940]   of this. At the same time, I think as institutions, we need to help give our students perspective.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:21.740]   Sometimes a student's whole world is a two inch by five inch screen. They think that's
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.900]   the world. That's all that exists. That's why they run into walls on accident and things
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.760]   of this nature, because they think that's all there is. And you have to remind them
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:40.580]   you're not in college or seminary just for you. You're not here just for you. If you
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:46.160]   think you're just here to get a job or to just do your own thing, that's not why God
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:54.220]   has you here. There is a greater plan that goes beyond you. And I think we need to energize
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:39:02.580]   our young people who are sorely tempted by this world to just focus on themselves, that
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:09.960]   there is a bigger commission, a global noble endeavor. There's a reason why Paul was never
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.820]   ashamed of the gospel. And that is because the gospel is full of honor. There is no more
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:22.420]   noble and epic enterprise than the work of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. And whether
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:29.580]   it be that they are those who will go and leave their homes and home countries, that's
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:36.260]   wonderful. But we need to remind every student in all of their disciplines, as Conrad was
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:42.900]   just alluding to, that we are all in this together. One way or another, we are going
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:48.220]   to unite to advance the mission. And it doesn't matter if you're an accountant, a physical
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:54.980]   therapist, a medical doctor, or a barista. We do discourage the barista part. But we
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:01.020]   want them to be involved. They have to. And they all have a vital role. We would never
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:06.180]   have the English Bible if the business people surrounding Tyndale did not support him and
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.540]   facilitate its distribution and supply him protection. You know, the people who reached
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.300]   Asia, like C.T. Studd and the Cambridge Six, they all came from college. They all came
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:22.500]   from college. This is a vital opportunity to remind our young people, whatever the Lord
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.960]   has for you, there is a bigger picture because the Lord has it for you. So we need to walk
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.700]   worthy of that. And then with that, introduce them to the practical things that instill
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.540]   the habits for the rest of their life.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.940]   >> Tremendous. Thoughts, Paul?
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:43.580]   >> You know, I would just ask each and every one of you, how often each week do you pray
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:49.580]   for laborers? You know, Jesus never said pray for money because to be honest with you, good
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:55.540]   men are more difficult to find than money. To pray, start off praying. But then there's
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:00.420]   another thing. If you go to 2 Corinthians chapter 8, which is a marvelous text all the
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:07.500]   way around, we see that there was a public appeal made with regard to Corinth. So it
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:13.460]   was made known. It was made known. And then it says God put an earnestness on Titus's
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:19.080]   heart and he went voluntarily. I think that when we go back to some of these missionary
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:29.020]   movements that gave us people like Amy Carmichael, I think the church was more in a proper way,
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:36.500]   not political, not militant politically, but the church was militant to take the gospel.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:42.860]   It was reflected also in its worship. I've noticed that a lot of worship today is more
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:49.580]   about me, where a lot in the great missionary movements, the hymns reflected let's go, let's
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:42:01.020]   go. And I think that pastors need to really work at putting this battle before young men,
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:07.740]   to put it before them and tell them, you know, we can live and die for something. We can
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:15.100]   serve a king incorruptible. We can build a kingdom that is eternal and will never fall.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:20.660]   There's a reason to be alive. You know, the Peruvians sometimes say, "Tu vives porque
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.100]   el aire es gratis," which means the only reason you're alive is because air is free. That's
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:33.340]   the way a lot of people live. And we need to constantly have this mindset of warfare,
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:42.780]   of warfare. There's great deeds to be done. And men were made to fight. You know, I think
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:49.020]   it's very appropriate to say, you know, a soldier wants to die by the last bullet in
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:56.980]   the last battle because that's what soldiers do. Men were made to fight, but it's the preaching
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:03.580]   in the pulpit of there's a greater thing out there to live for that's going to inspire
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.100]   young men to get off their phones and to get to the field. Also, I think it would be a
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:18.460]   great ministry that could be promoted is just people going out and making documentaries
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:24.140]   about the need. Sometimes I'll see documentaries about the need and I mean, I'm 63 and I'm
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:30.460]   like wanting to saddle my horse one more time. We need to put that in front of the people.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:37.980]   I knew a missionary who came back to the States, Carlton Allen, independent fundamentalist
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:44.140]   Baptist, one of the finest missionaries I ever knew. You couldn't go three feet anywhere
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:50.020]   in his church without seeing a picture of a missionary, a verse about missions. The
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:58.500]   man, there's no telling the legacy of his life just because he constantly reminded men
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.740]   and women. One last thing, borrowing from William Carey at heart cry, we say you're
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:09.180]   either called to go down in the mine or you're called to hold the rope for those who go down.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:14.700]   People need to realize that it doesn't matter what station of life you're in. You're part
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:20.220]   of the church militant. You know, heart cry exists not just because we have missionaries
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.780]   who are willing to die. It exists because of businessmen who want to use their money
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:32.700]   for something eternal. My own life, every man here, I think will be shocked when we
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:38.180]   get to glory and find out that it wasn't so much about us as the fact that the Holy Spirit
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:46.420]   raised up little old ladies to pray for us. And the grace that flowed from Christ because
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:52.100]   every person is a part of this great endeavor. And I believe that it is this great endeavor
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:57.940]   that everyone needs to learn is the very thing that they're looking for. A reason to live
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:05.900]   and die for Him. If I ever go out as a martyr, the last thing I want to say is long live
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:13.460]   the King. Long live the King. And we need to have that spirit in every one of us.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:21.740]   >> You know, I love that idea, Paul, of praying regularly from the pulpit. And we do try to
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:28.920]   do that in our church every Sunday. We're remembering the need for men to be called
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:37.780]   to ministry, called to missions. That's critical. And in addition to that, I think we also need
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:43.300]   to really strive to model for the younger men, ourselves, and Paul, you're a really
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.740]   good example of that. You get young men surrounding you all the time. But to model for them what
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:54.100]   it's like to be a godly minister in the service of God so that young men look at your life
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:59.420]   and say, there's something really I want to emulate there. There's something that's gripping
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:06.280]   me when I watch that man and hear him talk and interact with him. So that you become
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.860]   a mentor for young men that you don't even realize you're becoming a mentor for. That's
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:16.220]   really critical. Spurgeon said something really interesting, and maybe he exaggerated it because
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:22.860]   I don't want to make people feel guilty unnecessarily here. But he said, when he talked to ministers,
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:29.780]   he said, how many young men, how many young men under your ministry have gone into ministry
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:37.400]   or missions because of your example? Because they've heard you preach, they've watched
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:44.740]   your life. And he said, that's usually the sign of a godly man. And that convicted me
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:51.100]   at the time because I was a young minister and nobody had come forward yet. But I think
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:57.460]   you need to be conscious of that and seek to also, when you see young men in your church
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:02.060]   that are godly, I'll go to them. I'll have a special visit. I'll take them out to lunch
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:08.080]   and say, could it be that God might be calling you to full-time service in his vineyard one
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.980]   way or another? And just having the minister come alongside them. Sometimes they say no,
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:19.260]   but sometimes they say, well, I'm struggling with it, but I don't know how to proceed.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.720]   I don't know where to go with it. And I say, well, tell me about what you're feeling. And
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:29.420]   talk to them and befriend them. So I think the local minister's involvement is very important
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   in this whole area.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:36.080]   >> It's such an important point for all of us as pastors. Speaking, again, kind of historic
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.960]   approach to missions, we've taken a very passive approach. We wait until people approach us,
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.480]   express their interest in the mission field. What you're saying, Joel, is we need to shift
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.600]   into a pursuant mode. We need to be prayerful and looking for those that we would challenge
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.360]   to go to the field.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.840]   >> And William Perkins, the father of Puritanism, actually had the reverse role. He said to
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.280]   a young man who was godly, or to all young men who are godly, he said, the first thing
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.600]   you need to ask yourself is, is God calling me to full-time service in His kingdom? Only
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   then do you have the right to consider another occupation. Isn't that interesting? We say,
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:22.080]   the way I grew up was you do it in reverse. Only if God really overwhelms you with a call
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.380]   are you to even consider a call, otherwise you're considered to be too presumptuous and
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.240]   too bold.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:36.320]   >> Brother, just one thing I think that the men should know here. In my interaction with
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:43.040]   a lot of the TMAI centers, whether it was, I don't want to leave anybody out of it, but
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.920]   when I look at, when I've been to Samara, you look at the guys in Germany, you look
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:56.120]   at the guys in Spain, and several other places, I've noticed they're like incubators. More
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:02.700]   than what I see here in the U.S. I see in all those different places, you know, there's
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:07.460]   these young men that are chomping at the bit. So maybe we could bring them back here to
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:15.960]   teach us. I don't know, but do you know what I mean? It seems like there's an unusual incubation
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.760]   of men, young men that want to give their life.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:24.680]   >> Well, and I think they're in context where the church is so weak, and these young men
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:34.520]   are so desperate to see God's Word transform lives in the church, and so there's that interest
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.920]   and that eagerness. I agree with you, we see that as well. Well, listen, we're all students
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.280]   of God's Word and we're called to preach God's Word. We attempt to do that faithfully in
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:50.680]   our own calling. We know that the overarching narrative or theme of Scripture is the unfolding
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:56.880]   of God's redemptive plan from Genesis to Revelation. It's interesting though, in most churches,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:03.840]   most pastors take a very topical approach to missions. Maybe it's one Sunday a year
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:09.920]   or even just one week a year, but those of us who are called to exposit the Scriptures,
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.160]   how can we faithfully in our expositional, approach to expositional preaching, mature
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.480]   the church with regard to their understanding of missions, let it coming out of the text
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.980]   on a more consistent basis. Thoughts?
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:36.280]   >> For me, if you're just giving these snapshots, they can't see this, I don't even know how
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:48.160]   to, this glorious scarlet river, this magnificent, complex, flowing in perfect harmony, tapestry
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:54.800]   of redemption. And the more they understand the brilliance of God's mind there, the more
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:01.480]   they see the power of it and then culminating in the person of Christ and culminating in
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.320]   what he did and then what it's going to bring about in the future. One of the things that
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:11.720]   I think that we're losing also is the idea of the eschaton, the glory of it, the joy
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:19.920]   of it. I've lived long enough to know that life is hard and ministry is long and the
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:25.640]   older I get, the more I go into the text and I'm thinking about what will the new heaven
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.240]   and the new earth be like? What will it be when Jesus comes back? Don't I want to fight
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.600]   now because this is my last chance to fight against sin, to fight for him? And I think
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:44.720]   we need this, we need preachers who are going to be able to lay out this magnificent tapestry
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.800]   before people and the more they see it, the more they'll get involved in missions.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:52:01.080]   >> Yeah, I use a consecutive expository approach to my own ministry and I honestly don't see
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:11.480]   the difficulty between that and the link with missions because as we already were saying
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   here, the entire Bible, the grand narrative of the Bible is in the direction of missions.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:28.920]   When we're talking about the Old Testament, Christ being in the Old Testament, again it's
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:33.960]   not so much that he's just popping up here and there if you search hard enough. It's
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:44.360]   the fact that that Old Testament is building towards preparing for his coming, pointing
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:52.640]   towards him. And so if you are expounding the Scriptures, even in the Old Testament,
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:53:02.960]   with a kind of biblical theology undergirding what you are teaching, you still will find
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.240]   that you are awaiting the appetites of your people for the work that Christ has given
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:19.720]   us working towards his coming. Of course, the New Testament plays in that direction
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:28.680]   itself. So I think the problem is if you are simply dealing with texts in a devotional
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:34.960]   way, you know, so David brings down Goliath, you can bring down your big problems kind
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   of thing. Then yes, they won't think in terms of the grand purpose of God across history.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:54.520]   And then if I can just throw in one more, and it's, if God's people can see what has
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:04.760]   been said in this conference from the beginning, that the Bible is about God. It's about his
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:16.120]   glory, his honor, his grand purposes. Once, it doesn't matter where they are in the Bible,
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:23.500]   when they are saturated, to borrow the phrase of the Apostle Paul, being filled with all
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:31.920]   the fullness of God, then again you find that, yes, there may be accountants, there may be
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:39.400]   doctors and so on, but somehow they will still want God to be glorified in what they are
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:47.320]   doing, and then also whatever they earn, they want to put it where the emphasis is in the
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:57.760]   grand purpose of God. So yeah, we shouldn't limit it to topics. I think there is the overall
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:06.920]   trajectory in the Bible, and wherever we dip in Scripture, we don't lose sight of it. Thank
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   you.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:13.440]   You know, the Spirit-anointed preaching with passion, whether it's going straight through
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:20.160]   Bible books or other methods, the people are going to catch it, and the minister is going
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:28.200]   to naturally speak about missions and evangelism often, because he loves the church, because
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:33.760]   Christ loves the church. And so when you love the bride of Christ so much, you're passionate
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.880]   about all these things, it will just come out. You'll bring it out of your text here
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:45.800]   and there where maybe other people don't even see it, because you're breathing, you're praying,
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:53.400]   you're living for the expansion of God's kingdom. "Thy kingdom come" is huge in the life of
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.320]   every Spirit-anointed preacher, and I think it will just come naturally in the preaching,
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.840]   and people will catch the flavor of it.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:08.440]   Yeah, just to build a little bit off of what Conrad said about, you don't preach David
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.280]   and Goliath and say you can kill your own Goliaths and all this kind of stuff. It really
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:20.480]   is about going back to seeing texts, to seeing the Scripture the way God wanted us to see
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:29.640]   it, not about us, but about Him. And it doesn't take very long to get a global perspective
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:38.880]   in Genesis 1. It's in the first verse. God created the heavens and the earth. He didn't
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:45.440]   create Israel, didn't say that there, and it doesn't say He created Abner, because I
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:53.040]   don't matter. But He did create the world. And so the "I" must be to the world. This
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:57:00.560]   is our Father's world. And with that, everything He is doing and everything He is revealing
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:06.280]   is to that end. It isn't just so that we can have a nicer life, even though there are blessings
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:12.920]   of following the Lord Jesus. We understand that. But it is to glorify Himself and His
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:22.280]   Son through the work of the Spirit in His people who proclaim Him. And that is what
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:28.680]   expositional preaching uncovers, every passage by passage by passage, when it is done according
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:34.040]   to God's intent, united with the writer's intent, because they all thought that way.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:40.820]   All of them thought that way. And with that, a consistent exposition gives the motivations
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:46.620]   for missions. It gives the methodology for missions, because now we have the rich theology
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:52.280]   that we need to understand what does it mean to instruct and disciple others. And it gives
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:58.120]   us the message of missions, because it reveals the gospel that we proclaim. And it gives
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:04.680]   us the message of missions, because every text has a point. There is a reason why Paul
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:10.500]   wrote those epistles. It was to ensure that the church, Jew and Gentile, would be the
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:18.140]   witness that Christ commissioned. We understand that. And so every text has a purpose. Every
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:24.180]   revealed truth has a purpose. And its purpose inherently by definition is missions. And
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:31.060]   so therefore, the faithful preaching of the Word of God, not the kind of preaching that
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:38.840]   just wants to tickle the ears or to satisfy some superficial desire, but really uncovering
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:47.180]   the truth of the Word of God, will take people's eyes off of themselves and on to the purposes
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:53.780]   of God in Christ and the truth unto Him and unto living for Him. And missions will always
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.260]   be supported in every sermon.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:02.480]   Tremendous, thank you. Well, as one who has benefited from Pastor John's faithful preaching
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:09.060]   of the Word and seeing a church that is just completely committed to the cause of Christ,
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:16.500]   the glory of Christ, motivated by the love of Christ, has such a mission's heart and
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:23.380]   reach, it has come as a result of that commitment to preaching the Word just as you've said.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:28.940]   Well, I have a lot more questions, so this isn't quite fair, but our time's up. I do
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:35.820]   want to just make a couple observations. Today in our gathering, as we mentioned, we have
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:42.780]   750 international pastors and guests with us. And I know, Conrad, as you've alluded
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:47.140]   to, Paul, your own ministry of HeartCry, Joel, you travel and are working with the church
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:53.860]   around the world as well as your ministry, Abner. We are seeing God at work through His
[00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:01.500]   church moving in the lives of what we would term, what we think is going to be a global
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:09.380]   missions movement, a movement that is anchored and flows out of the authority and sufficiency
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:15.860]   of Scripture. We like to say mature churches become sending churches. And so we're beginning
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.420]   to witness that in our generation. It's very exciting. It's not just the Western church,
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:24.860]   but it's the global church. And so we're excited. We want to do our part. Joel, you mentioned
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:30.300]   a great new book that came out to equip others. There's other ministries that are publishing
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:36.060]   good sound resources to kind of stem the tide and provide alternatives for what's out there
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:42.180]   with regard to missions and missiology. It's been a joy for us to be involved in that endeavor.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:48.380]   These men have participated in this project with us, the biblical missions book that you've
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:52.380]   all received in your box of books. If you haven't picked that up, just know it's there
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:59.060]   as well as the workbook that goes along with us. I mention it here because what we want
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:04.260]   you to know is this labor of love born out of these very convictions that we've talked
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:11.940]   about, both a theological foundation for missions, the role of the local church in missions,
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:17.180]   and then a biblical approach to every practice of evangelism, outreach, church planting,
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:23.700]   Bible translation, mercy ministry, whatever it might be to bring it back to the scriptures.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:30.140]   And this book was written for your church. This was a resource written for you as pastors.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.940]   Yes, it's large. It's three volumes in one, but it's designed to use through the workbook
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:41.400]   in your local church. A small group can use it. You can use it in one of your equipping
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.620]   classes or Sunday school class. It's also designed to be employed for those of us involved
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:54.100]   in higher education, Bible colleges, or seminaries. And so we want you to know about this project
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:58.380]   because—and it was released this week. You're the first ones to have it in your hands. It
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:02.740]   just came out. And we wanted to release it at Shepherds Conference to put it in the hands
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:07.580]   of pastors who are gonna be committed to the very thing that we're discussing this week.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:13.900]   And so there's gonna be future resources made available to you through our ministry called
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:19.580]   the Center for Biblical Missions, which will be coming out in September of this year. The
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:23.820]   book is available. You can begin to use it this year. We have almost a hundred churches
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:29.040]   that have signed up to teach a missions course in their local church using this resource.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.100]   If you'd like more information about the QR code in your program, you can scan it. You
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.220]   can contact us. We'll coach you through that, exactly how to implement that. We'd love to
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:43.700]   have you be a part of this first pilot group of churches that are employing it. And then
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:48.620]   through the center, good biblical resources that we can share with those who are looking
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:54.460]   to engage in missions. But in addition to that, there's gonna be a feature of that center
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:03:00.220]   which does consulting with pastors and local churches about how to assess, realign your
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:06.460]   mission strategy in accord with clear biblical principles, and then using those in our network
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:11.460]   who've done that in their churches to be a resource as a consultant with you so that
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:16.180]   you can call them, ask them questions, and be encouraged in that process of helping your
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:21.340]   church make sure that its missions ministry is aligned with the principles that we see
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:26.520]   in scripture. So be encouraged. We hope this will be a blessing to you and that together
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:32.060]   in our generation we'll be part of what we think is a reformation in missions back to
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.240]   the authority and sufficiency of scripture. And so we're grateful for your partnership
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.500]   in that. All of you here obviously are good friends of our ministries. I know speaking
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:47.180]   for TMA, I just want to say thank you for your support of the missionaries, the training
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:52.260]   centers, and all that you do. We're grateful that this is a shared labor of love, and we
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:58.660]   are seeing God bless that and bearing fruit to the glory of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:04.020]   Amen. Alright, well thank you for joining us for our Q&A today, and we'll let you go
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.380]   at this point. Guys, thank you.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:12.380]   [applause]
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   [silence]
