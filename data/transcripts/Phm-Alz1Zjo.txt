[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.580]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.560]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.080]   My guest today is Dr. Lori Santos.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.720]   Dr. Lori Santos is a professor of cognitive science
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.280]   and psychology at Yale University.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.480]   She is a world expert in happiness
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.160]   and in the science of emotions generally.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.520]   Today, we talk about true happiness,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.800]   not in any kind of loose and aspirational way,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.760]   but instead what the research really tells us
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.460]   about how to create lasting happiness for ourselves.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.680]   We talk about relationships and happiness,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.700]   that is relationships of all kinds,
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060]   between friends, between romantic partners,
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.760]   between family members, and of course, with ourselves.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.360]   We talk about all of that in the context of what to do,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.080]   what not to do, and how to frame your whole notion
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.840]   of what happiness is and how to attain it
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.680]   in the context of daily to-dos.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.680]   For instance, most all of us by now have heard
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.360]   about the power of gratitude and gratitude practices.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.840]   In fact, I've done an entire episode
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.480]   about gratitude and the science of gratitude.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.920]   But Dr. Lori Santos today explains
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.400]   that by shifting our orientation toward gratitude,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600]   toward something more aligned with what delights us,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.960]   we are able to better tap into the mechanisms
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.440]   that enable us to feel happier in a more pervasive way.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.760]   We also discuss topics such as hedonic adaptation,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760]   that is how our pursuit of things
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   and our whole experience of pleasure sets the stage
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.120]   for what's going to feel like a meaningful pursuit
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.800]   and pleasurable in the days and weeks to follow.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.740]   This is very important for everyone to hear,
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.240]   especially in this modern age of so-called dopamine hits,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.480]   easy to achieve dopamine, highly processed foods,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.360]   and the various things that you can find online.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.560]   And speaking of online, we also discuss the role
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.200]   that smartphones and social media play,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.600]   not just in our happiness, but in our cognition.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.500]   You'll be shocked, indeed, I was shocked to learn
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620]   that just having your phone in the room
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.560]   where you are trying to learn something
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160]   significantly diminishes your performance
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.760]   on things like mathematics and the learning of other topics.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.720]   We get into all of that today, the interrelated parts,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.280]   and I promise that it's all made extremely clear
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.040]   and actionable thanks to Dr. Lori Santos'
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.000]   incredible expertise, and she is an incredible teacher.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.540]   In fact, the course that she has taught at Yale University
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.040]   entitled "Psychology and the Good Life"
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.840]   is the most popular course ever taught at Yale
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.040]   over the course of 300 years.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.560]   And that popularity will not come as a surprise
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.040]   as you now get to learn from Dr. Lori Santos directly.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.120]   This was a remarkable episode, I must say.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.880]   I learned so much, and I'll just highlight one big takeaway
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.320]   that I've implemented in my own life
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.000]   and that you can frame in the back of your mind
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.520]   as you listen to today's episode,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.680]   is the difference between being happy with one's life
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.640]   as opposed to in one's life,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.100]   and indeed how to achieve both.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.060]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.780]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.060]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.900]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.940]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.420]   to the general public.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.500]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.340]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.300]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.940]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.540]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.560]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.700]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.260]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.380]   That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.940]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.180]   And one of the best ways to ensure
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.520]   that you get a great night's sleep
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.020]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.340]   And that's because in order to fall
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.780]   and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.560]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.100]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.580]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.540]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.100]   about one to three degrees.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.700]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.900]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.480]   by allowing you to control the temperature
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.600]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.760]   and end of the night.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.640]   for nearly four years now,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   and it has completely transformed
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.080]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.240]   Eight Sleep has now launched their newest generation
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.840]   of the Pod Cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.000]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.240]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.680]   and even has snoring detection
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.980]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.360]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.520]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.900]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.440]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.040]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.560]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.960]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by ExpressVPN.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.080]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.320]   that keeps your data secure and private.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.840]   It does that by routing your internet activity
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.600]   through their servers and encrypting it
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.800]   so that no one can see or sell your data.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.000]   Now, I'm familiar with the effects
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.920]   of not securing my data well enough.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.520]   Several years ago, I had one of my bank accounts hacked,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.420]   and it was a terrible amount of work
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.080]   to have that reversed and for the account to be secured.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   When that happened,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.640]   I talked to my friends in the tech community,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.720]   and what they told me was that
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.280]   even though you think your internet connection
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.480]   may be secure, oftentimes it's not,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.440]   especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.560]   such as those on planes, in hotels,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.960]   at coffee shops, and other public places.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.560]   Surprisingly, even at home,
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.600]   your data might not be as secure as you think.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.060]   To make sure that what I described before
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.600]   would never happen to me again,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.900]   I started using ExpressVPN.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.520]   The great thing about ExpressVPN
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.480]   is that I don't even notice that it's running,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.720]   since the connection it provides is so fast.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.040]   I have it on my computer and on my phone,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.400]   and I keep it on whenever I'm connected to the internet.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.140]   With ExpressVPN, I know everything is secure,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.660]   my web browsing, all my passwords, all my data,
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.040]   and of course, anything that's behind an account wall,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.960]   like a bank account.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.800]   It can't be tracked,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.680]   and no one can access or steal your data,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.600]   which is terrific.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   If you'd like to start protecting your internet activity
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.040]   using ExpressVPN,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.400]   you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.480]   and you can get an extra three months free.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.480]   Again, that's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/huberman
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.160]   to get an extra three months free.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.660]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Laurie Santos.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.760]   Dr. Laurie Santos, welcome.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.120]   - Thanks so much for having me on the show.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.540]   - I want to talk about this thing
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.880]   that everyone seems to want,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.100]   but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.320]   in a state of happiness,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   which raises the question of whether or not
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.240]   we should even be seeking to constantly
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.360]   be in a state of happiness.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.460]   But just to sit back from that question for a moment,
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.680]   how should we think about the relationship between emotions
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.400]   and this thing that we call cognition?
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.000]   Because I think a lot of where we're going today
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.920]   is to distinguish between feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.680]   And as neuroscientists, psychologists, et cetera,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.820]   we have to understand the difference
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.840]   between emotions and cognition
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.980]   and maybe where they overlap.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.940]   So if you could educate us a bit on that,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.980]   I think that will set the stage nicely
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.500]   for understanding happiness.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.900]   - Yeah, well, I'm glad you started there actually,
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.540]   because the very definition of happiness, I think,
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.940]   as social scientists tend to think about it,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.020]   includes both of these parts, right?
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.360]   So I think social scientists tend to think about happiness
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.260]   as being happy in your life and being happy with your life.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.660]   So being happy in your life is sort of the emotion side,
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.080]   right, a decent number of positive emotions,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.960]   maybe slightly less negative emotions.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.240]   Like you existing in your life feels good.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.700]   That's kind of an emotional part, right?
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.740]   But then there's also kind of
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.080]   how you think your life is going.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.000]   Do you have purpose?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.680]   Are you kind of happy with how things are going?
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.640]   It's how you think about your life,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.600]   which is sort of a cognitive thing.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.400]   And so even the earliest social scientists
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.800]   who started thinking about happiness,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.320]   at the time they call it subjective well-being,
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.160]   'cause I think psychologists were like,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.200]   "Ooh, happiness sounds too wooey.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.040]   "We'll call it something else."
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.240]   But it means exactly the same thing.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.020]   It means subjective well-being, right?
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.720]   When they started thinking about subjective well-being,
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.080]   they divided it into this sort of affective emotional part,
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.160]   which is like how you feel in your life,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.520]   but also this cognitive part,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.360]   how you think your life is going.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.400]   So that basic dichotomy has been there
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.880]   since the very beginning of folks
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.720]   studying happiness scientifically.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.120]   - I'm already struck by this distinction
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.600]   between how things are going in your life
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.520]   versus with your life.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.120]   One requires a kind of first-person experiencing of life
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.640]   in your life, you know?
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.860]   You wake up feeling good.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.340]   Are you feeling good with your,
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.740]   inside of your friendships and other relationships,
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.300]   family, romantic relationships, school, work?
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.020]   The other involves a bit of a third-personing of self.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.460]   I'm looking at one's CV,
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.900]   either actual CV or reflected CV
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.140]   through the lens of other people
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.420]   and kind of getting a sense like,
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.260]   am I doing well?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.240]   Am I not doing well?
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.380]   I think this is a really important distinction
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.440]   because it seems like ultimately the goal,
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.160]   if I may, is to be happy in your life,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.760]   regardless of the third-personing,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.240]   provided that you're not doing damage
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.320]   to somebody else's happiness in life.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.720]   - Yeah, well, I think ideally it'd be nice to do both,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.560]   right?
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.380]   And I think there are moments
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.120]   when these things dissociate, right?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.400]   So, you know, you interact with lots of interesting,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.020]   rich people out here in California.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.720]   I think a lot of them have,
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.680]   it kind of in their life feels pretty good, right?
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.960]   They have lots of hedonic pleasures,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.120]   they're drinking nice wine, hanging out at the beach.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.020]   - You'd be amazed at how much suffering they report.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.940]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.860]   - How much suffering they report.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.700]   - So this is the question,
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.140]   is this sort of cognitive part the third-person part
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.780]   or is it the reporting part?
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.420]   And I think when the psychologists are thinking about it,
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.980]   they really think about it as the reporting part, right?
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.300]   And this gets tricky, right?
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.740]   Because I see folks having their nice glass of wine
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.580]   on the beach and I'm thinking like,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.420]   that's coming with lots of positive emotion.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.980]   Like I bet if I tested them
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.540]   and could have a direct look at their sensory experience,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.220]   it'd probably be pretty positive.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.000]   It's only when they reflect on their life
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.320]   and they're asking, "Well, how's it going?"
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.640]   That they say, "Oh, I don't know, my stocks went down."
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.520]   - When I hear about lack of happiness,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.960]   let me think of some of the kind of bullet point ones
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.120]   that seem to come up repetitively.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.240]   They are indeed not related to lack of resources,
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.680]   I don't hear that.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.240]   What I've heard, and this is also true
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.720]   for where I spend part of my time
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.080]   and where I grew up, which is in Silicon Valley,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.840]   which is also not everyone, but there are people there
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.460]   who've accrued tremendous amount of wealth.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.660]   The mean has shifted very high
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.100]   and hence the cost of living.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.980]   But it's often concerns about their kids
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.100]   or their mother is ill.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.500]   Their child is struggling in a particular way.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.520]   Very often that's what it is.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.140]   They're concerned about the lack of wellbeing in their kids
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.800]   related to mental health or physical health
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.940]   or other relatives, mental health, physical health,
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.020]   or they're upset about something politically,
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.860]   but we won't go there.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.700]   - We won't go there.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.340]   Yeah, no, I think this is true.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.440]   So much of our happiness is made up
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.600]   of the happiness of other people.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.820]   Both kind of how they're doing
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.840]   and how we think they're doing cognitively,
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.340]   but literally just emotionally.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.540]   If you've ever been around a family member
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.620]   or a spouse who was incredibly pissed off, really sad,
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.260]   it's incredibly hard not to catch those emotions yourself.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.780]   And we as psychologists know how these processes work.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.360]   These processes are emotional contagion
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.800]   where you're literally catching the emotions
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   of other people.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.180]   And so oftentimes the things that you most worry about
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.700]   to be happy yourself is focusing on the happiness
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.540]   of the people around you
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.560]   because that literally becomes your happiness
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.000]   at a very fundamental level.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.020]   - Yeah, I'm pausing just to think about this
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.320]   a little bit more.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.500]   As we grow up, and I realize it varies by place
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.340]   and lots of circumstances, but as we grow up,
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.320]   we are taught to pay attention to how our life is going
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.620]   a bit from the outside, where you gain evaluations
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.140]   starting really young.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.580]   Little stars on our pictures, or good job,
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.220]   or nowadays they say great effort in drawing.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.580]   - This whole thing, the growth mindset language.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.660]   But I don't know that in the United States
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.420]   we are taught to think about being happy in our life.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.260]   - Yeah.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.300]   - And as kids, I think all kids, all mammals
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.500]   seem to gravitate towards joyful experiences for them.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.940]   Playing is almost always an innate joyful experience.
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.920]   But then as the evaluations start coming in,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.140]   we get better and better at assessing our performance
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.120]   and where we are relative to the sort of standard goals
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.820]   of the third grade, the fifth grade, the 12th grade.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.780]   But at the same time, I don't think anyone ever sat me down
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.780]   and said, how are you going to evaluate
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.620]   if you're feeling good in your life?
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.340]   Like that you're savoring your soccer game,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.180]   that you're savoring your time with friends.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.660]   That was never taught to me.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.340]   - Yeah, and I think there's a real danger
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.220]   of these kind of extrinsic rewards,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.900]   as you might call them, all the stuff outside,
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.920]   the grades, the performance measures and so on,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.300]   literally stealing your intrinsic rewards.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.140]   There's this funny phenomenon in psychology
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.520]   where if you have something that's intrinsically rewarding,
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.660]   so let's say exercise, right?
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.780]   Like I want to go out and run a bunch, right?
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.620]   I love running.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.520]   I get this intrinsic reward from running.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.500]   Now I get some sort of tool, whether it's my watch
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.780]   or something I'm scribbling down in a phone app,
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.860]   and I have to log my running.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.820]   Now it becomes a sort of extrinsic reward.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.500]   It's not just like the feeling of running,
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.420]   but it sort of takes on this extrinsic idea.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.700]   And then what happens is sometimes we end up going
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.220]   for that reward anyway.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.620]   The fiction writer David Sedaris has this wonderful article
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.060]   called "The Fitbit Life" where he talks
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.180]   about how he wanted to get fit.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.060]   It's intrinsic reward of exercising more,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.460]   and he got the Fitbit, and then it was all about the Fitbit,
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.260]   and he would set the level higher and set the level higher,
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.100]   and he himself was miserable and no longer enjoying running
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.580]   to the point that at some point he just would walk around,
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.020]   you know, shaking his arm just to get up
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.460]   to those final steps, right?
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.960]   That's a really terrible case
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.460]   where your extrinsic reward winds up taking over.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.020]   But so many of the cases you just talked about
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.900]   are ones in our real life where that comes up
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.780]   much more insidiously than with a Fitbit
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.620]   or something like that.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.500]   You talked about play in mammals,
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.900]   the easiest thing that little kid animals do
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.940]   all over the place.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.220]   Little kid humans don't do that as much anymore
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.300]   because even from really young ages,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.140]   they're, you know, in toddler, you know, university
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.460]   where they're kind of learning things
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.740]   to get into the next grade and get the perfect grade
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.180]   so they can get into institutions like ours, right?
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.260]   It all becomes about extrinsic rewards.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.020]   And so I think you're really right.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.420]   We're kind of extrinsic sizing all the rewards
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.620]   to the point that we're not getting to internal happiness.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.100]   It was hard already to pay attention to that stuff
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.820]   because I think we'll probably talk about this.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.300]   It's hard to be mindful about your emotions.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.580]   You really have to pay attention to what's going on.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.120]   But I think it's gotten even harder
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.740]   because we have these metrics.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.300]   They're all over the place in our culture,
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.860]   but they're just not the intrinsic thing.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.200]   There's some extrinsic marker
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.380]   that could make the intrinsic thing even less fun.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.540]   - For people that grow up or live in areas where,
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.340]   well, let's just say that have less disposable wealth,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   is there must be data on sort of relationship
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.940]   to intrinsic versus extrinsic forces on happiness.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.300]   I mean, I can make up all sorts of stories in my head
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.920]   about how people starting out
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.200]   from very different circumstances
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.340]   would be more or less happy, but what do the data say?
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.000]   - Yeah, so these effects of kind of resources on happiness
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.800]   are really interesting and they're nuanced, right?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.720]   So if you look at the lower end
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.040]   of the kind of income spectrum,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.000]   you would obviously say that money affects happiness, right?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.320]   If you can't put food on the table,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.640]   if you can't put a roof over your head,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.080]   definitely getting a little bit morning
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.480]   is gonna affect your happiness in a positive way.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.860]   And the data sort of bear this out.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.080]   There's a very famous study
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.640]   by the Nobel Prize winning economist, Danny Kahneman, RIP.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.280]   Back in 2010, he did this cool study
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.560]   where he looked at the correlation
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.780]   between income and happiness
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.940]   as reported in how much stress you have,
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.240]   how much positive emotion you experience and so on.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.640]   At the low end of the income scales,
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.000]   it just goes up and up and up, right?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.200]   More money just almost linearly gives you more happiness.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.240]   But what Danny found,
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.440]   and is the second part of this nuanced picture,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.120]   is that that slope kind of levels off
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.320]   and it levels off in 2010 dollars at around $75,000.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.160]   What does that mean?
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.720]   That means if you get more than $75,000,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.480]   you're not gonna feel any less stress,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.600]   you're not gonna experience any more positive emotion.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.700]   Even if I double or triple or quadruple your income,
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.380]   on those metrics, you're not gonna see any increase.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.100]   - Then those are pre-tax 2010.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.620]   - Yeah, they didn't get into like the real,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.620]   'cause you're like, "Oh my God, well, I live in California.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.140]   "Like, if you live in Iowa, maybe it's not so bad."
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.100]   But like, and those numbers will change,
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.740]   but the upshot is there's probably some number
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.260]   in like 2025, 2024 numbers that might be like,
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.500]   you know, maybe $100,000, $120,000, whatever it is.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.620]   The point is that there's some number
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.020]   at which getting more is not gonna increase your happiness
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.420]   at the same slope.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.340]   Now there's been nuanced fights about this,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.820]   as there is a lot in kind of real research,
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.940]   about, well, is that really true?
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.820]   Does the slope really ever go up?
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.000]   And now the picture seems to be,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.500]   well, the slope might go up a teeny tiny,
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.620]   like negligible bit, but it doesn't go up as much as say,
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.820]   getting an extra 10 minutes of exercise in,
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.540]   or another 20 minutes of sleep,
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.220]   or scribbling the things you're grateful for.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.500]   All those things will impact your happiness much more
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.620]   than like quintupling your income.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.580]   And so do your resources affect happiness?
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.320]   Yeah, if you ain't got any resources,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.540]   you definitely will feel happier if you can get them.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.740]   But if you have a lot,
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.740]   getting more really isn't gonna help.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.260]   - Sorry to interrupt, but lately I've been saying
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:31.260]   on the basis of those findings about this then 75K per year,
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.500]   probably now, like you said, 100 to 125K,
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.360]   or let's just say something like that,
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.660]   would be the equivalent amount
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.220]   that money indeed cannot buy happiness,
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.420]   but it can buffer stress.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.340]   Do you think that's true?
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.980]   You're making me rethink that statement.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.660]   Maybe it doesn't buffer stress past a certain amount.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in the original Kahneman data,
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.540]   he found that it doesn't, right?
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.480]   I mean, how much stress you report on a daily basis
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.100]   was literally one of the measures
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.060]   they were using for happiness.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.620]   But I think you're right.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.900]   The risk around it can buffer it, right?
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.980]   I think if you're at a certain set of means,
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.000]   you know that like, if a bad thing happens,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.100]   you're going to be okay.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.980]   So it can allow you to make riskier decisions.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.900]   It can allow you to do things that you might not do
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.820]   if you're right at that boundary or losing some money,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.460]   it might pop you back down.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.700]   I think the problem is that one of the ways we evaluate
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.660]   our financial situation, but pretty much every situation,
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.460]   I think this goes back to the neuroscience,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.740]   is that we don't do it objectively, we do it relative.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.300]   And when you think about your relative financial status,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.700]   there's lots of other folks around
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.380]   to whom you're comparing yourself.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.540]   I think one of the reasons that rich folks
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.700]   don't necessarily think they're less stressed
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.260]   when they have very high levels of wealth and so on
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.540]   is because they're looking around
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.180]   and everyone's doing much better than them.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.900]   And this is just a fundamental feature
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.540]   of the way we evaluate stuff, right?
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.620]   Is that we don't evaluate in objective terms,
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.740]   we evaluate relative to these reference points.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.380]   And honestly, as you get richer,
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.100]   you're kind of going up this sort of logarithmic scale
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.180]   where the reference points are getting
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.940]   even further away from you.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.700]   And I think that that can have a huge hit
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.020]   on people's perception of their own happiness
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.960]   and their perception of their stress levels, right?
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.300]   Because they're working towards a goal
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.180]   that's probably not gonna make them that much happier,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.720]   but they haven't kind of abandoned this intuition
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.740]   that more money will make me happy.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.960]   On my podcast, "The Happiness Lab,"
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.860]   I had this guy, Clay Cockrell, who was really fun.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.420]   He's a wealth psychologist.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.260]   So he's a mental health professional
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.000]   that only works with the 0.0001%.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.380]   And already we should say, well, if wealth made you happy,
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.340]   he should be out of a job.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.500]   But no, he's lots of clients,
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.060]   lots of, I guess, very well-paying clients.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.500]   He looked like he was doing well for himself.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.540]   But he talks about how those folks
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.940]   haven't abandoned this notion
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.480]   that more money will make them happy.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.900]   They set some standard, like as soon as I become,
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.620]   as soon as I get 50 million, I'll be happy,
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.460]   or as soon as I become a billionaire.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.800]   But then they get to that point,
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.660]   they're not feeling any more positive emotion,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.780]   they're not feeling less stressed.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.140]   And rather than saying, well, hang on,
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.460]   maybe that hypothesis was wrong, more money doesn't work.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.740]   They say, ah, the hypothesis, it's all right,
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.420]   more money will make me happy.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.060]   I just get a, it wasn't 50 million,
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.340]   now it's 100 million or whatever it is.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.340]   And so I think that that's a lot due to the fact
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.180]   that folks are comparing their wealth levels against others.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.740]   And our comparison system sucks
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.620]   because we constantly compare ourselves against others.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.940]   But we never pick people that are doing worse than us.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.860]   We always pick people who are doing better than us.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.660]   - I know a fair number of very happy, wealthy people.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.860]   I know a fair number of very miserable, wealthy people.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.420]   I know a fair number of happy, non-wealthy people,
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.060]   and a fair number of miserable inside,
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.500]   where they report feeling miserable, unwealthy people.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.540]   - Well, it fits completely with what
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.560]   a lot of the happiness research suggests, right?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.700]   Which is that it's much less about our circumstances
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.780]   than we think when it comes to who's happy and who's not.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.380]   And we often think, if I could get more money
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.020]   or if I could get more accolades at work,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.360]   or if I could get a new partner,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.780]   if I could move somewhere, I'd be happier.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.100]   But exactly what you're saying,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.940]   if you look at people
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.380]   with all those different life circumstances,
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.140]   both the good version and the bad version,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.620]   you find some happy folks and some not so happy folks.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.300]   And now what researchers are starting to think
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.060]   is that it actually doesn't involve our circumstances
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:09.900]   as much as we think.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.020]   Again, I like with bracket it,
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.460]   unless those circumstances are really dire.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.300]   Circumstances don't matter as much as we think.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.940]   It tends to be the kind of stuff
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.740]   that's much more under our control
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.020]   than our circumstances, right?
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.060]   It tends to be how we behave,
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.660]   what thought patterns we use, the emotions we seek out,
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.660]   the social connection we experience.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.180]   Those things matter much more.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.660]   And so I think your experience
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.820]   with the happy and not so happy rich folks
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.540]   and the happy and not so happy poor folks
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.380]   kind of bear what we think,
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.500]   like it's just not your circumstances
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.620]   that doesn't matter as much as you assume.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.260]   - Let's talk about this relationship
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.100]   between feelings, thought patterns, and behaviors
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.060]   in the context of happiness.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.700]   I think anyone listening to this or watching this
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.020]   probably wants to be happy as much as possible.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.100]   I mean, I suppose there are a few songwriters, poets,
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.620]   and I've got some friends in those domains of life,
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.460]   and they do seem to derive a lot of insight and inspiration
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.300]   and have done amazing things
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:11.500]   through the kind of depths of unhappy human emotion.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.220]   We can get back to that later
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.620]   because I do think there's something about the contrast
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.940]   of moving from these more painful emotions to happiness
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.460]   that's very different than moving
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.060]   from a state of immense happiness to slightly less,
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.940]   but we can get back to that.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.580]   But most people would like to be happy as much as possible.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.180]   I certainly would, who wouldn't?
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.460]   And one, of course, can ask,
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.140]   "Well, should I work on my feelings,
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.980]   "like think about my feelings, try and shift my feelings,
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.720]   "let my feelings move through me in a cathartic way?
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.020]   "Should I work on the thought patterns?
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.100]   "Should I work on the behaviors?"
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.100]   I'm a big believer from my own experience
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.900]   that behaviors are powerful
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.740]   in setting the general trajectory
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.920]   of thought patterns and feelings,
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.720]   but I've also experienced it going the other way too.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.060]   So what does the research say about this?
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.420]   And what can we do?
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.860]   'Cause everyone wants to be happier.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.060]   - Yeah, well, we just talked about
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.900]   the thing you're not supposed to do.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.560]   You don't have to change your circumstances.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.580]   And that's great 'cause quintupling your income is tricky,
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.420]   moving is tricky, switching your life around
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.620]   all over the place is hard, right?
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.780]   And the good news is the science shows
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.620]   you don't have to do that.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.180]   That doesn't work as well as you think.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.700]   But you can hack your behaviors and your thought patterns
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.100]   and your feelings to get some good results, right?
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.780]   Let's take behaviors, right?
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.620]   One of the biggest behavioral changes
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.220]   you can make to feel happier
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.740]   is just to get a little bit more social connection.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.260]   Like psychologists do these fun studies
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.300]   where they look at people's daily usage patterns.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.120]   So how much time are you spending sleeping
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.020]   or exercising or at work or whatever?
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.900]   And the two things that predict
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.340]   whether or not you're happy or not so happy
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.540]   is how much time you spend with friends and family members
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.660]   and how much time you're just physically around other people.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.100]   Like the more of that you do,
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.380]   the happier you're gonna be.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.180]   And that's just a correlation, right?
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.100]   So you're savvy listeners are thinking right now,
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.300]   like, well, is it that hanging around with other people
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.380]   causes you to be happier
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.840]   or do you tend to like hang out with other people more
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.680]   if you are happy?
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.900]   Like which direction does the causal arrow go?
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.180]   And here we have these lovely studies
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.620]   by psychologists who do these kind of funny experiments
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.040]   where they offer people like a $10 Starbucks gift card
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.860]   to just talk to somebody.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.220]   Usually talk to a stranger
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.540]   like that they don't know on the train.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.100]   Some lovely work by Nick Epley and others have done this.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.140]   Because you force people to get social.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.180]   And what people predict, especially with strangers
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.260]   is like, ooh, that's gonna feel awkward and kind of weird.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.540]   But what you find across the board,
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.940]   and this includes an introverts and extroverts,
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.060]   is that talking to somebody actually feels good.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.580]   It increases your positive emotion.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.300]   It gives you a sense that your life is going better.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.780]   You feel less lonely.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.380]   It just has these positive outcomes that we don't expect.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.580]   - I love social connection.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.460]   The problem I have with social connection
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.620]   is that if I drop in with somebody for 30 minutes
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.940]   or a couple of hours, when that's done,
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.980]   I usually have so much that I need to tend to
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.020]   that I end up staying up later than I need to
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.900]   in order to complete that, diminishing my sleep.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.700]   And then I feel like there's a underlying
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.620]   kind of like sinking ship sense to my physiology,
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.020]   and then I have to recover my sleep.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.140]   So everything's a trade-off.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.300]   - What's interesting about the study you just mentioned
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.260]   is that it's just a brief coffee, presumably.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.140]   So maybe one doesn't need to spend quite as much time
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.960]   with people.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   I think, you know, I think like even years ago,
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.060]   actually he's dead now, but there was a,
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.020]   I guess it's okay to say it even though he's dead.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.460]   He was a somewhat eccentric professor at UC Berkeley.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.460]   I took a class from him when I was a graduate student there
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.420]   named Seth Roberts.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.540]   He's known for some kind of bizarre theories about eating.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.380]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.200]   - And if people want to look this up,
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.100]   I mean like really, really kind of different stuff.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.180]   But I applaud his bravery and just, you know,
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.340]   being out there, but he was an eccentric guy.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.460]   And he told us in this class, when I was there,
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.540]   that it was very important to see faces
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.500]   at least once a day, real faces, not on a screen.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.660]   This was before social media.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.580]   But, and that it was important at some point
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.260]   to leave your apartment and like see the barista
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.420]   and say hello and thank you and see people on the street.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.060]   And now knowing what we know
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.820]   about these dedicated areas of the brain,
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.860]   like the fusiform face gyrus and Nancy Kanwisher's work
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.700]   and about these brain areas.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.940]   Like we are hardwired for seeing faces
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940]   and recognizing faces.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.460]   Now that alone doesn't mean that seeing faces
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   is a requirement for being happy on a consistent basis.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.460]   But I think they were onto something.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.900]   I think Seth was onto something,
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.380]   even though he had some also just like
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.900]   completely crazy ideas.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.500]   This idea doesn't seem crazy.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.540]   This has been my experience,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.300]   even though I spent a lot of time alone.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.900]   If I go a few days without seeing a face,
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.620]   something happens inside that shifts
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.140]   the way my internal kind of set point for wellbeing.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.340]   And then you see somebody and it's like delightful,
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.660]   even if it's just a hello.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.580]   - Yeah, I mean, I think, you know,
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.700]   the reason why social connection matters so much
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.500]   is it's building off this basic neural circuitry, right?
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.780]   For seeing faces and so on.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.180]   I think that gives us a real insight
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.100]   into the kinds of social connections that work best, right?
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.540]   Which has been characterized in the field
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.500]   as sort of in real time social connection, right?
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.900]   Which we're kind of moving away from.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.540]   So what do I mean by in real time?
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.820]   You know, you and I are sitting in a studio right now,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.900]   chatting and we're kind of chatting in real time.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.820]   I can see your face, we're live.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.700]   But we might've been able to do this like
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.140]   over some sort of video chat.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.500]   Wouldn't be as good, you know, but it's pretty good.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.780]   And the reason it seems to be pretty good
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.840]   is we're doing it in real time, right?
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.880]   Our auditory system, our visual system,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.180]   all these systems that are used to as primates
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.260]   processing things with other folks around you,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.900]   it works reasonably well.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.500]   What doesn't work so well is how we often communicate,
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.660]   which is like over Slack, over text.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.340]   I text you, vroom, three minutes later, vroom,
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.180]   it comes back.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.460]   Like our primate brain's just like,
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.660]   that's just not the way communication is set to work.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.460]   And so I think sometimes when I bring up social connection,
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.340]   people think like, oh, I got to see people in person
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.740]   and my friend's gonna live far away.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.100]   And I'm like at work all day.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.060]   It's like, no, no, no, you can connect,
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.580]   not necessarily live and in person,
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.020]   but as much as possible, try to do it in real time.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.140]   And I think that's in part,
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.880]   and if possible, try to do it with video,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.620]   I think for the reason that you were just talking about,
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.580]   'cause it's faces activate us.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.860]   But we're primates that are also really good at language
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.340]   and paying attention to the voice.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.980]   I think it's one of the reasons that like
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.620]   an old school phone conversation,
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.140]   no video chat with your friend
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.940]   can be some of the most emotional connective conversation,
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.700]   sometimes better than in person.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.540]   'Cause when we're in person,
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.020]   we're pulling out our phones and checking
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.340]   and paying attention to other stuff.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.360]   But we got to get back towards in real time.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.740]   The other stuff just doesn't have the same psychological oomph.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.740]   - Is there any evidence that texting actually drives
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.220]   more of a desire for more social connection
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.980]   and thus leaves us feeling less well
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.620]   than prior to a text exchange?
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.700]   I realize it's very hard to separate out the variables
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.940]   about what's the nature of the text exchange.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.020]   How often do you see this person in real life, et cetera.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.620]   But I could imagine that texting,
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.460]   that I don't do the sound effect as well as you do.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.220]   I like that.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.540]   But that texting could be the equivalent
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.940]   of getting crumbs of nourishment, not full nourishment.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.940]   I could also imagine that it's like putting nourishment
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.460]   just out of reach.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.780]   And I'm asking this really at a neurological level.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.380]   Do we know, is the reward circuitry that's triggered
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.320]   by in real life social connection triggered,
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.280]   but to a lesser degree by text exchange or by Zoom exchange?
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.740]   This would be an important study to do, I think.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.420]   - Yeah, there's not great evidence for it,
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.060]   but my intuition is that the way it works
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.420]   is almost like it's texting
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.300]   sort of the NutriSuite of social connection, right?
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.740]   I was feeling this motivation for social connection
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.100]   and I did it and I got something that was sort of social.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.260]   I got some information, but psychologically,
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.940]   I'm missing the nutritious part of it, right?
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.140]   So it kind of fakes you out
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.700]   into thinking that it's social connection,
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.540]   but it kind of doesn't really work.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.220]   And I worry that that's what we're all getting
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.900]   a lot of right now, right?
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.620]   It's just so much easier to participate
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.260]   in the NutriSuite version of social connection
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.660]   because as political scientists and sociologists
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.500]   and others have pointed out,
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   it's harder to meet with people in real life.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.700]   We don't have these so-called third spaces
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.380]   where we can get together easily anymore, right?
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.940]   There's so many draws of just being on your screen,
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.860]   being alone inside.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.060]   I think we're kind of missing out.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.700]   And so a lot of us are kind of starving nutritionally
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.980]   when it comes to social connection
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.780]   'cause we're going for the wrong stuff.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.980]   - So schedule some, if possible,
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.540]   in real life time with somebody.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.860]   - Or in real time, right?
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.540]   Call that friend that you haven't talked to
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.780]   and recognize, 'cause this is clear
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.100]   from the psychological research,
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.340]   that your brain is not telling you to do that.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.860]   Probably even when you're listening right now,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.140]   you're like, "Yeah, I guess that would be helpful for me,"
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.940]   but you're not kind of having a craving
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.460]   to talk to your friend.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.660]   And I think this is the problem
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.220]   with a lot of the behaviors that map onto happiness
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.420]   is that if you think of the evolutionary pressures
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.780]   for those behaviors,
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.900]   natural selection never had to build in
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.380]   the goal of feeling social
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.980]   'cause we were just like in these small bands.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:06.860]   It was really easy, right?
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.780]   Natural selection had to build in a kind of craving
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.260]   for sweet, fatty food 'cause those were hard to find.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.460]   Didn't have to build in the craving
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.340]   for a bunch of greens 'cause they were everywhere.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.540]   I think the same thing is true with social connection.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.180]   We just don't have a strong motivation to seek people out
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.940]   because it was just kind of there.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.260]   And so I think our motivation and our reward systems
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.380]   don't cause us to kind of crave it.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.340]   But in the modern day where there's so many substitutes
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.140]   and we're kind of more isolated,
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.500]   I think many of us are kind of experiencing
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.360]   the negative effects of loneliness.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.200]   But then when we think,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.500]   "Well, what could I do to get out of it?"
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.740]   There's not this like, "I'm starving for connection."
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.600]   We don't have this sort of motivational goal
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.860]   to go out and get it.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.180]   And so what that can lead to is people making the prediction
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.020]   in their head of like,
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.100]   "You know, I just heard Laurie say that this is a good idea,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.820]   "but like, I don't know, probably not for me
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.420]   "or maybe not as important."
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.740]   I think we just don't have systems
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.180]   that tell us to go out and get this stuff.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.540]   So even if your brain is saying,
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.280]   "That's not that important," try it.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.780]   Do your own personal experiment
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.420]   and get a little bit more in real time social connection
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.300]   and just take a moment to notice immediately
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.940]   after how it made you feel.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.260]   And I bet it'll be like, you know,
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.140]   all the kind of fitness hacks and nutrition hacks
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.420]   that you talk about on the show where you're like,
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.140]   "Oh my God, that made me feel so much better
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.820]   "than I really expected it to."
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.940]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.580]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.140]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.260]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.700]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.780]   all of your foundational nutritional needs
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.900]   and it tastes great.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.660]   Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.100]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.580]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.460]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.780]   to purchase one supplement
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.820]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.220]   The reason for that is even though I strive to eat
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.940]   most of my foods from whole foods
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.700]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.420]   vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.580]   micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.500]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.300]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.740]   I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.220]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.900]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.620]   my physical health, my mental health
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.700]   and my performance, both cognitive and physical are better.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.260]   I know that because I've had lapses
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.500]   when I didn't take AG1
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.380]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.380]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.460]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.980]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.420]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.540]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.700]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.140]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.260]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.620]   to claim a special offer.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.860]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.420]   and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.900]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.180]   to claim that special offer.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.180]   - If seeing faces, and I don't have evidence for this,
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.700]   but if Seth Roberts was right
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.460]   and what we're talking about here
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.820]   is clearly based on existing data.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.100]   If seeing faces somehow triggers the reward system
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.580]   in a healthy way that reinforces the social connection thing
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.860]   that like fills the vessel that like we're connected
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.180]   because we no longer live in small village
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.380]   and tribe type formats, most of us don't anyway,
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.700]   that if we plop down onto the couch
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.680]   and kind of like assume the classic C-shaped position
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.420]   of somebody who's about to go on their phone
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.620]   and you can scroll and see faces.
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.140]   You talked about that as a bit of like
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.820]   an artificial sweetener giving the illusion
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.660]   of some sort of nourishment.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.460]   And then, you know, you see some stuff,
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.620]   you respond to stuff,
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.620]   you can see someone kind of dunk on somebody,
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.300]   maybe hear a joke, maybe make a joke,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.060]   and then go into your DMs and like read a few, check a few.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.500]   And then you basically got no real social connection.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.460]   - Correct.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.920]   - You didn't have to move to do it.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.020]   And in a lot of ways, this has parallels
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.180]   to the ease of highly processed foods
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.380]   or something like that.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.540]   And I think we're starting to understand this a bit
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.580]   through Jonathan Haidt's work and other people's work,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.740]   including your own,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.220]   but I don't know that it's anything
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.020]   but really dangerous and bad.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.680]   I don't wanna sound alarmist,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.260]   but I am really concerned that certainly
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.780]   for the younger generation,
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.500]   but that if we don't have an intrinsic drive
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.020]   to go do something.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:20.860]   - We stop doing it.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.180]   - We stop doing it.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.540]   And then the brain is pretty plastic
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.500]   throughout the entire life,
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.820]   especially for these low grade,
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.860]   like many times repeated behaviors.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.660]   I mean, we can just slowly, you know,
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.660]   it's like there's drift.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.100]   And then we wonder why we don't feel so good.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.260]   - Yeah, I mean, you know how the dopamine system works,
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.100]   right?
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.500]   Like it has these mechanisms to crave stuff
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.120]   that's quick, quick hits, right?
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.740]   Our instant, you know, when we go on Reddit
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.620]   or go on Instagram and scroll through a feed,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.820]   we're getting these kind of quick hits.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.100]   Another thing that is rewarding is new information.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.300]   You know, you're at Stanford College,
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.380]   Jamil Zaki's done these lovely neuroscience studies
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.180]   that just finding out some interesting social information
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.500]   feels rewarding.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.140]   And kind of for the first time,
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.180]   we've been able to separate the reward value
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.580]   that comes from interacting with live human people
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.260]   and faces and social rewarding information
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.240]   that comes at us quickly at this dopamine hit
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.540]   that we crave a lot,
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.340]   but we don't have the craving mechanisms
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.260]   for the in real life connection.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.300]   And yeah, I think that's causing a lot of problems
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.180]   and it means we're kind of building more tools
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.020]   to do just that.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.700]   I had the musician, David Byrne on my podcast.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.540]   - Talking heads.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.700]   - Talking heads, David Byrne,
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.100]   who cares a lot about these issues.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.740]   He wrote this really cool article
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.340]   called "Eliminating the Human,"
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.180]   where he made the claim that pretty much
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.020]   every technological invention of the last 20 years
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.260]   has been dealing with actual people is kind of frictiony,
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.980]   so let's just get rid of them, right?
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.580]   We'll have Uber or Lyft or a car company
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.020]   where I don't have to talk to the driver,
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.540]   I just plug it into the phone.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.860]   We don't have to have a conversation, we go away, right?
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.660]   We have music and streaming mechanisms.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.300]   I don't know, Andrew, you're like my age,
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.220]   so you probably remember
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.240]   that you used to have to go into a record store
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.580]   to flip through CDs or tapes even,
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.260]   if you're really old school, to figure out music.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.340]   And often when you do that,
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.620]   you'd run into humans or talk to the cashier guy
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.980]   or somebody would see you flicking through like,
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.020]   oh, you like talking heads?
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.180]   I like talking heads.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.340]   Now we just go to an algorithm, right?
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.740]   From food delivery apps to kind of education, right?
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.180]   I have an online course where students don't have to sit
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.620]   in a real classroom with other students,
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.260]   they could watch it directly.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.220]   So many of our technological innovations
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.140]   are assuming that what we wanna get rid of
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.140]   is the friction part.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.060]   That's what we're kind of motivated to get rid of.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.100]   But ultimately, we're getting rid of the human
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.860]   in these interactions and our primate brains are left
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.380]   with the like little NutriSuite dribbles of connection
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.980]   when what we really need is something in real life
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.340]   and in real time.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.220]   - It's interesting because I think just,
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.940]   but 10, 15 years ago, our knowledge of most all humans
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.340]   was based on in real life experience,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.540]   except for, I guess, famous humans,
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.140]   and then it was not in real life.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.020]   Now, most people's knowledge about most humans
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.140]   is based on not in real life interactions.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.060]   Which means that most people's knowledge
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   about humans generally is kind of accruing
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.020]   through non in real life electronic experiences.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.380]   And so that has to change our entire schema
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.500]   of like what human experience is.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.180]   I'm not trying to like ratchet up
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.500]   to something too abstract here,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.860]   but I think it's a powerful notion
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.900]   that what Byrne is saying
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.020]   that we're kind of dehumanizing ourselves
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.900]   through getting essentially fragments
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.140]   of in real life experience.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.740]   And video is so captivating as somebody
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.980]   who was a vision scientist for a long time.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.620]   I mean, if a picture is worth a thousand words,
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.820]   a video is worth 10 billion pictures.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.140]   It's just the number of videos that you can access
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.500]   in an Instagram feed or even on an X feed
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.660]   is just astonishing.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.180]   And then of course the high emotional salient stuff
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.940]   is gonna be the stuff that you hover on.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.500]   And then the algorithm knows your dwell time as it's called.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.020]   And then your basic feed and discovery is set by that.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.380]   And I don't think there's anything
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.980]   really inherently diabolical about it.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.500]   I don't take that stance.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.380]   It's just, they figured out some good neuroscience
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.740]   based on behavioral forging.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.740]   - Yeah, I mean, the diabolical part
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.300]   is having a real consequence for our happiness.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.740]   It's certainly having a real consequence for loneliness.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.900]   You look at rates of loneliness in young people
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.340]   who've grown up with these technologies
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.660]   and you see things like young people today
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.460]   report being lonely at rates of like 70, 75%, right?
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.620]   More people are lonely, extremely lonely than not right now.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.780]   - How do we rate loneliness?
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.660]   I'm not dismissing what they're saying,
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.780]   but since they grew up that way,
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.740]   this sounds very cross-generational judgment,
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.180]   but like, how do they know they're lonely?
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.140]   - I mean, your point is well taken, right?
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.860]   If anything, they grow up lonely.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.700]   So if they're self-reporting being lonely now,
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.940]   it might be even worse
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.780]   than it might be kind of getting worse over time.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.020]   Yeah, and so, I mean, this is all self-report data, right?
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.580]   So people, you know, on a scale of one to 10,
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.620]   how lonely are you feeling?
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.300]   But the fact that 75% of people are saying,
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.060]   "Yeah, I feel extremely lonely."
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.180]   That's sad.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.220]   I mean, if our primate ancestors,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.340]   if they could look at us, would be like,
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.700]   "What are you doing with these wonderful social brains?"
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.540]   - They were probably like,
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.140]   "Oh, I wanna go hide behind that rock for a little bit,
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.580]   "get a little bit of space."
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.320]   I'll never forget years ago when I,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.900]   there was this time when I worked with ferrets,
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.060]   I don't miss it, and they would have these huge litters
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.540]   and there were these, in these pens,
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.780]   the mom could climb up and get up on top there.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.140]   And so she'd have these huge litters
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.980]   and she'd kick the litter off at some point.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.620]   She'd go up there and sleep.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.740]   And you'd go in there to take out the moms
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.460]   and they did not,
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.280]   that was the only time
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.700]   when they didn't wanna be bothered, right?
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.080]   Because they loved to be held and things like that,
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.980]   but they did not want to be bothered
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.060]   because they just needed some peace
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.820]   'cause they had like 16 ferret kits, you know?
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.220]   So I think that nowadays, right,
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.140]   if there's a lot of loneliness
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:05.020]   and people that are growing up in these electronic formats
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.260]   report feeling lonely, and I believe them,
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.740]   then what it speaks to is a yearning.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.700]   And to me, a yearning is a neurological drive,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.580]   the same way that a room that's too warm,
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.500]   you wanna get to a cooler space.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.620]   If it's too cold, you wanna get to heat.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.420]   So that loneliness speaks to an underlying yearning
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.900]   for something that they're not getting,
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.540]   I'm just stating the obvious.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.900]   But it says that we're,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.660]   or they are doing something
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.580]   that's inherently against the grain
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.620]   of their healthy neurology.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.620]   - The problem is, I think what loneliness
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.740]   is a recognition of is,
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.400]   you know, you kind of don't like this state,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.700]   but I'm not sure that loneliness is causing people
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.820]   to seek out more social connection.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.060]   Or if it is, you're seeking out the thing
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.060]   that is the easiest, fastest social connection you can get.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.340]   - This is just like food.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.460]   - Which we've talked about as the nutritious food, yeah.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.980]   - You're not craving vegetables
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.620]   because they were presumably in abundance
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.660]   at one time in our evolutionary history,
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.060]   as opposed to meat or sweets or things like that,
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.220]   fruit and meat.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.300]   - And I think this is a problem with social connection,
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   but I think it's a problem generally
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.860]   with the kinds of things that make us happier.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.020]   Because like, we just don't have mechanisms
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.220]   to seek those things out.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.300]   They just kind of don't code in our reward system
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.100]   in the same way as, you know,
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.420]   the NutraSweetie stuff of the world.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.660]   - So what is the term, if there is one,
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.040]   or could you come up with one?
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.140]   I don't want to put you on the spot.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.140]   For a fundamental desire that's healthy for us
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:33.860]   that we are not driven to pursue a resolution to.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.020]   Like for everything else, you know,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.780]   there's like the hypothalamic circuits
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.900]   for the desire to mate, to seek warmth when it's cold,
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.260]   cold when it's, you know, when it's too warm.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:47.060]   You know, we know what hunger is, right?
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.100]   But there must be something about the,
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.340]   I don't want to get too technical here.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:53.560]   For those that are tracking this or not tracking this,
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.180]   what I'm trying to say is, you know,
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:59.460]   for so many of the reward punishment pathways
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.300]   in the human brain,
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.900]   it's you're trying to avoid the feelings of pain
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.020]   and move toward the feeling of either neutrality
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:05.900]   or pleasure.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.500]   But here you're talking about being in a sort of place
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.060]   of low level pain, being able to meet that pain
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.640]   with a truly low level pleasure,
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.860]   that then it doesn't mask the pain,
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.360]   but it fills the vessel just enough
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.920]   that then you drive yourself into a place
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.620]   of actually more pain.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.560]   - But I think that this is the kind of thing that happens
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.480]   when you have easy outs for all these cravings, right?
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.120]   I mean, take processed food, right?
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.560]   You probably have a craving
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.280]   for certain nutritional requirements, right?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.760]   You want to get vitamins or healthy stuff,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.920]   but that stuff's easy, it's frictionless, right?
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.840]   You know, I run to McDonald's and that's much faster
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.440]   than cooking up a really healthy vegetable filled meal.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.680]   I think the same thing happens with social connection, right?
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.720]   Like you're a lonely person at your house,
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.600]   sitting on the couch,
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.480]   you have this negative bodily state, you feel lonely.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.320]   Maybe it kind of manifests as a craving,
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.160]   but what's the fastest thing for you to do?
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.360]   I'm gonna scroll through my friend's Instagram feeds,
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.440]   or I'm gonna get a kind of little mini hit
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.760]   of social connection that's not as nutritious.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.560]   Honestly, I mean, not to dis our respective fields,
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.000]   but I actually think this is one reason
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.180]   that people love podcasts so much, right?
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.600]   It's a frictionless way to feel like you're part
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.400]   of this interesting conversation,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.560]   but ultimately it doesn't work as well
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.760]   as picking up the phone and calling a friend,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.540]   connecting with someone in real life.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.920]   I think we have too many outlets
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.120]   for things that kind of feel socially,
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.460]   but don't give us social nutrition.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.300]   And it's true.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.120]   I mean, we should be honest,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.960]   like really connecting with actual people in real life
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   takes more friction than pulling out your phone
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.760]   and scrolling through your Instagram feed.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.640]   It's just the Instagram feed doesn't work as well ultimately
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.880]   when it comes to what's really gonna end up being rewarding.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.080]   And I think this is true for just like a lot
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.400]   of the way the reward system works.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.520]   The things that we have craving for, that we seek out,
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.280]   that like we've really strong mechanisms to go after,
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.920]   sometimes those things don't work
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.520]   to get us towards real likability.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.560]   You know, drugs of addiction
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.520]   are a real obvious answer to this, right?
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.120]   You know, if you have a kind of heroin problem,
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.660]   you're gonna really seek out that drug,
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.000]   but ultimately it's not bringing you towards something.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.960]   I mean, we'll maybe feel good in the moment,
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.800]   but it's, you know, no, you're not NutraSweetie,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.240]   but it's not getting you towards something
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.240]   that evolutionarily would be really awesome
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.800]   for your survival and reproductive success.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.960]   - Well, I try my best not to speak in tweets,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.660]   which I guess they now call ex-posts,
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.600]   but I've been saying a lot, and I'll say it again now,
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   that I think everyone should beware any dopamine
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.080]   that is not preceded by effort in order to achieve it.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.520]   In other words, any fast, high inflection of dopamine
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.360]   that does not require effort to achieve it
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.760]   is gonna put you in a trough
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.000]   and on a, you know, a metaphorical lever-pressing cycle
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.800]   that will drive your trough deeper and deeper over time,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.240]   and that peak will just never go as high as it did,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.060]   or could, again, unless you take a period of abstinence
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.840]   from that behavior or substance,
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   and then introduce effort prior to adaptive behavior
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.220]   to get the dopamine.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.340]   The other thing is I like to think of addiction
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.080]   as a progressive narrowing of the things
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.400]   that bring you pleasure, and I don't speak to enlightenment,
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.960]   but happiness or enlightenment seems like
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.880]   a progressive broadening of the things
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.160]   that bring you pleasure.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.760]   And I'm glad we're talking about reward circuitry
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.840]   because we know how to reset that reward circuitry,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.960]   and it doesn't require these dopamine fasts,
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.120]   although that's one approach,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.600]   and it makes sense why people do it,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.240]   but I think this notion of having to spend effort
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.320]   to engage in what we know as a hardwired source of reward,
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.800]   not just dopamine, but other neurochemicals as well,
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.160]   of course, in the form of social connection.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.920]   So this higher friction thing of having to call somebody
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.720]   or drive someplace or deal with traffic,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.800]   deal with traffic on the way home,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.280]   well worth it if it was a good social interaction,
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.720]   but maybe it was a meh social interaction,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.560]   in which case you're like,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.360]   "Oh, that was a lot of driving today.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.200]   "I've got now all this other stuff to do."
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.440]   Other times, a great social interaction
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.860]   can set you in an amazing emotional plane
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.840]   for days, if not weeks.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.600]   So I think what you're bringing up is really important.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.480]   How do we introduce these behaviors,
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.000]   not asking you to put it into a standardized protocol
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.320]   too much, but since we started with this issue of behaviors
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.000]   being a path to more happiness and social connection
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.600]   being the in real life social connection
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.520]   or by phone in real time, as you said,
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.160]   being one of the main paths to behavioral happiness,
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.500]   behaviorally derived happiness, excuse me,
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.600]   then what are the data on sort of the frequency of this?
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.720]   Does it vary for introverts versus extroverts?
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.980]   This question is getting very long,
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.000]   but maybe we could define introverts and extroverts,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.200]   and then if you would, if you could give us some sense of
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.400]   how often should people seek out
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.720]   an in real life interaction.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.480]   - Yeah, probably way more than you think you should.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.240]   We have good data on what people predict,
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.640]   which is that people predict social interaction
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.400]   is just not gonna be that fun.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.040]   It's not gonna be worth it.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.900]   This seems to be a spot where our predictions
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.220]   about how good something is gonna be
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.640]   don't necessarily match how good
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.480]   it ultimately will gonna be.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.160]   And I put it in the context of the reverse
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.320]   of something like processed food,
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.360]   where I think for a lot of people,
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.840]   you predict this is gonna be amazing,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.640]   you taste it, you're like, "No, I feel kind of gross."
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.520]   - Processed food. - Processed food, right.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.120]   That's a case where your prediction is like,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.240]   "Ooh, this is gonna be awesome,"
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.720]   but your actual likability is like,
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.480]   "Eh, I feel kind of yucky."
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.320]   Where social connection, I think we predict be all right,
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.880]   but maybe not that good,
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.200]   but when we get it, we feel really great.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.120]   The University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.920]   has this term he uses, undersociality,
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.680]   where he thinks we just kind of don't get the right
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.880]   reward benefit of social connection, writ large, right?
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.280]   He talks about examples of expressing gratitude to people,
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.600]   giving somebody a compliment,
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.640]   even things like asking for help, right?
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.360]   All these domains where we can kind of connect
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.880]   with another person, we sort of was like,
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.720]   "Yeah, it may be net good if I was rating it on some scale,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.280]   "but it winds up being way better
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.620]   "than we predict in all these contexts."
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.600]   He does these studies where he has people
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.040]   predict how good something will be.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.720]   Giving a gift to somebody, he's in Chicago, right?
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.880]   So he's like, "Here's a hot chocolate.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.260]   "How good will it feel to give that guy over there
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.360]   "a stranger the hot chocolate?"
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.360]   And people say, "You know, I don't know, three out of 10."
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.480]   But then they do it, and then they feel,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.780]   "Oh, it's more like a six out of 10.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.480]   "It was much more rewarding for me, the giver,
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.440]   "than I thought."
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.960]   Same thing with compliments, expressing gratitude,
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.080]   calling a friend you haven't talked to in a long time,
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.840]   reaching out to somebody that you care about,
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.240]   but you haven't connected with.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.260]   All these spots are ones where our predictions are off.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.720]   It's not the valence that's off.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.280]   We know it'll be good, but we just don't realize how good.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.060]   And his argument is that if we don't realize how good,
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.220]   then we never seek it out.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.080]   So it's kind of the opposite of what you might think
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.400]   of as the processed food problem,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.740]   where our prediction is like,
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.620]   "Oh my God, that cupcake's gonna be so good.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.100]   "We have all these mechanisms that are like,
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.400]   "go get it, go get it."
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.300]   But then we actually get it.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.280]   We're like, "That wasn't as good as we thought."
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.700]   I think that the problem is that we have all these things
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.640]   that work like the processed food,
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.780]   that interfere with social connection,
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.600]   going on the Reddit feed,
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.200]   plopping down and watching Netflix,
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.740]   just kind of being by yourself, right?
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.240]   There's all these alternative behaviors
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.240]   that we're predicting are gonna feel nice,
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.240]   but then we get there, they feel kind of yucky.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.880]   They just, yeah, this is a problem in the happiness space
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.760]   where, I know you talk a lot about the reward system,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.680]   but the happiness space is one where the cravings we have,
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.000]   the rewards we seek out,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.440]   the predictions we're making about what feels good,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.180]   we're often just really wrong with them.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.740]   You know, my podcast, we talk a lot about like,
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.620]   our mind lies to us when it comes to happiness.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.380]   You know, we go for more money, we go for accolades,
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.900]   you know, we go for the quick dopamine hits
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.220]   without any work,
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.100]   but really it's more like social connection.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.940]   It's all these things that we kind of don't expect
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.840]   are gonna feel good.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.260]   And so, I actually don't know
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.580]   what that means evolutionarily.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.460]   Like my theory is like,
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.460]   you didn't need to build in craving mechanisms
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.500]   'cause the things that really matter for our happiness,
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.780]   we just kind of got for free
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.660]   in the evolutionary environment,
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.380]   but it means it's hard to go after them.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.040]   You mentioned introverts and extroverts,
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.320]   and just to get back to your longer question,
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.120]   this is something that's been studied in them.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.020]   So introverts versus extroverts
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.780]   is typically thought of as a personality distinction,
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.220]   often thought of as sort of something that's built in,
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.860]   although there's lots of evidence that over time,
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.520]   you can sort of change these things around.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.420]   You could become a little bit more extroverted
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.300]   if you're introverted,
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.820]   but introverts tend to value deeper close conversations,
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.220]   one-on-one kinds of things,
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.360]   and a lot of alone time.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.140]   They get a lot of benefit from alone time,
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.220]   whereas extroverts tend to be more energized
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.900]   by being around other people,
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.460]   especially bigger crowds of people.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.500]   And so introverts tend to be a little bit more deliberate,
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.780]   a little bit more thoughtful,
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.100]   a little bit more kind of wanna have
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.940]   my own personal chill time,
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.060]   whereas extroverts tend to like people.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.220]   And so you might think that everything I've just said
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.900]   applies to extroverts, but not to introverts.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.580]   Folks have gone out and tested this,
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.480]   and what they find is there is a big difference
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.500]   between introverts and extroverts,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.220]   but it's in that prediction error.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.620]   You know, extroverts predict a social connection,
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.140]   we are right, not that great.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.860]   Introverts predict it's gonna be terrible,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.860]   it's gonna be awkward, I'm gonna hate it.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.300]   But when you actually force people,
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.340]   as in these studies where you say,
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.740]   "Hey, $10 Starbucks gift card,
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.060]   "you gotta talk to somebody."
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.420]   When you force the introverts to be social,
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.220]   what they wind up doing is self-reporting,
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.380]   you know, a level of happiness
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.540]   that's like better than they expected.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.340]   So the problem seems to be
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.340]   that introverts have a prediction error.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.220]   I'm gonna say this, I promise you,
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.380]   'cause I've said this on my podcast, tons of hate mail.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.380]   Lots of the comments would be like,
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.860]   "Not me, not this introvert."
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.460]   - Or maybe they don't quite understand,
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.420]   so I wanna make sure that it's crystal clear for people.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   Introverts anticipate a less than great
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.460]   or even eh interaction, maybe even a negative interaction.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.860]   - It's usually negative, usually negative.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.740]   - They anticipate a negative interaction.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.340]   So it's like saying we're gonna go to a restaurant
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.420]   and the food here, like it sucks.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.540]   They go in, they have a decent to maybe a great interaction.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:36.540]   So introverts are positioned to derive more pleasure
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:40.340]   from social interactions than extroverts
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.920]   who enter social situations thinking it's going to be great.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.020]   Their anticipation is high
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.860]   and therefore they require a much bigger dopamine inflection
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.600]   in order to come away from that interaction
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.540]   saying it was great.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.740]   Although the one kind of update to the framework
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.020]   that you just presented that I'd add
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:59.100]   is that you said, you go to the restaurant,
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.820]   you predict it's gonna be not that good and you go
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.100]   and you're like, "Oh, it was all right."
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.220]   I think the problem with introverts
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.980]   is they so predict that social connection
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.420]   is gonna be awkward that they don't engage in it.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.620]   And now this becomes a learning cycle, right?
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.820]   You predicted it was gonna be crappy,
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.260]   you never got any evidence, "Oh, maybe I was wrong."
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.740]   And so you keep doing that over time.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.580]   And so I think that this can lead to cycles
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.460]   of loneliness in introverts.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.980]   And there are these lovely accounts of introverts
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.460]   who try to become a little bit more extroverted.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.580]   I had this lovely woman, Jessica Pan on the show,
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.420]   who has this book called, "Sorry I'm Late,
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.100]   I Didn't Wanna Come," colon.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:32.380]   - I love that title. - Colon.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.220]   - I'm actually pretty social, but I'm late to everything
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.500]   'cause I'm an academic.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.820]   Noon means noon 10, which means starting at 12.15,
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.660]   which means at 1.15 when the lecture
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.340]   was supposed to end at one,
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.820]   you're still going and half the room is full.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.260]   - But this is not just like, she had a reason, she's like--
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.780]   - Any academic knows what I'm talking about.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.100]   - Yeah, no, I'm with you, I'm with you.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.540]   But dude, "Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Wanna Come,"
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.380]   colon, an introvert's guide to extroverting.
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:56.180]   So she did this year, where as a super hardcore introvert,
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.580]   she talked to people, joined an improv comedy group,
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.060]   like went to these social networking kind of business-y,
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.860]   nasty social connection events, just did all this stuff.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.820]   And what she found was two things.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.420]   One is that she actually did enjoy it
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.620]   a lot more than she thought.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.900]   At the end of the year, she was much happier
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:10.820]   than she expected,
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.620]   but she also watched her habits changing too.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.820]   And this is a thing I think that we also get wrong
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.060]   about introverts and extroverts,
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.700]   is we assume, "I'm born that way, I'm never gonna change."
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.660]   And it is true that there are predispositions
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.760]   towards this stuff.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.380]   But the data suggests that if you can maybe update
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.780]   your reward value of this, as an introvert,
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.020]   try a little social connection.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.820]   Don't go to the hugest party ever,
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.020]   or jump into improv comedy.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.140]   Just try, call a friend that you haven't talked to
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.140]   in a while, right?
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.260]   Notice how that felt.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.220]   Like, "Oh, that was a prediction error, right?
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.300]   "I actually felt better than I expected."
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.100]   Then you might update your prediction.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.020]   And so you can kind of update your introversion in part
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.900]   by trying things out and noticing the reward value you get.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.700]   I think the thing that is different for introverts
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.020]   is like, you definitely need your alone time, right?
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.180]   So you wanna balance any social connection you get
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.820]   with a little bit of time by yourself.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.140]   But the research really shows
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.380]   that if you're predicting right now,
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:02.700]   like, "I just don't like the social connection."
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.760]   You might actually like it more
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.700]   than your prediction is suggesting.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.900]   - I don't wanna micro dissect social interactions
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.380]   to the point of becoming artificial,
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.660]   but I'm fairly introverted.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.020]   I love New York City and I love London.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:17.340]   I love busy cities.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.940]   So I don't mind being surrounded by people,
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.620]   but one by-product of being surrounded by people
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.740]   in a big city is you're not interacting with everybody.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.860]   You're seeing lots of faces.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.140]   So is it the case that introverts are really uncomfortable
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.260]   in big social interactions?
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.340]   Or, you know, to me,
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:38.020]   the most mentally demanding social interaction
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.460]   would be one where I go to a party
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.500]   where I know there's gonna be like 20 people.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.660]   Everyone's gonna have to go around the room
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.020]   and introduce themselves, goodness.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.760]   Clearly I don't have a problem with public speaking,
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.420]   but that to me just like spikes my cortisol immediately.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.220]   And then there's sort of an expectation
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.260]   of like real connection.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:56.100]   The expectation of real connection
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.900]   oftentimes undermines real connection.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.500]   Sometimes it serves it.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.220]   But is it the case that introverts want to avoid people
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.380]   or they want to avoid the requirement
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.140]   to really engage in a deep way?
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.260]   And I like engaging in a deep way one-to-one
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.500]   or maybe with two or three people, you know,
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.340]   maybe a few more,
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.820]   but I don't know that it's the number of people
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.780]   that becomes overwhelming or daunting
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.900]   or the punishing feature.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.140]   It's more, you know, the sort of requirement
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.980]   to like be pulled out of oneself.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.980]   - Yeah, I think it might be all of the above.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.540]   I mean, I think what we know about introverts
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.060]   is that they often self-report being better
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.700]   in these sort of one-on-one kind of things.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.700]   So as an introvert, it's like,
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.340]   you're gonna have a coffee date with your friend.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.340]   That often doesn't cause as much social anxiety
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.860]   as like the dinner party with a bunch of people, right?
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.420]   And so that's the claim.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.860]   It's not like, well, jump into the dinner party
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.900]   with a bunch of people or join an impromptu comedy group
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.020]   or talk to everyone on the street.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.340]   It's like just a one-on-one little mini conversation
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.780]   can be great and not necessarily great,
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.300]   but much better than you expect.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.820]   And we'll kind of have this happiness benefit
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.380]   that kind of sustains you over time.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.620]   Nick Epley, who does all this work,
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.100]   talks about your happiness.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.500]   The best metaphor for happiness
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.060]   is that it's kind of like a leaky tire,
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.860]   like it sort of goes out a little bit.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.580]   And each one of these little conversations,
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.420]   whether it's chatting with the barista,
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.300]   calling a friend, giving someone a compliment, whatever,
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.780]   kind of fills up the tire and then it kind of goes down.
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.500]   So you can sort of use these little mini micro doses
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.340]   of social connection to boost your happiness tire.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.660]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.380]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.020]   I recently became a Function member
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.300]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.300]   to lab testing.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.220]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.180]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:37.820]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.700]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.500]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.760]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.180]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.940]   Function not only provides testing
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.020]   of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health,
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:55.900]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.460]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.300]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:05.420]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.740]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.540]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.420]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.900]   but offered medical doctor informed insights
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.580]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.900]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.660]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.020]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.920]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.980]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.740]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.300]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.700]   is so important for health.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.500]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.420]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.900]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.780]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.300]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.020]   as well as how comprehensive
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.380]   and how actionable the tests are,
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.620]   that I recently joined their advisory board
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.860]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.180]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.480]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:01.080]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.660]   but they're offering early access
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.900]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.180]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.260]   to get early access to Function.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.740]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.260]   that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.140]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.580]   all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.900]   Proper hydration is critical
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.020]   for optimal brain and body function.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.660]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.300]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.580]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.300]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.840]   are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.100]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.500]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.940]   makes it extremely easy to ensure
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.800]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.420]   and adequate electrolytes.
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.580]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.180]   and electrolytes, I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.220]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.220]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.720]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.440]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.100]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.180]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.060]   and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:05.900]   They have a bunch of different
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.740]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.820]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.080]   Frankly, I love them all.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.380]   And now that we're in the winter months
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.800]   in the Northern Hemisphere,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.780]   Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.100]   I really like the chocolate flavors,
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.020]   especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.460]   So you put it in hot water,
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.340]   and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.580]   and hydrate, especially when it's cold and dry outside,
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.540]   when hydration is especially critical.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.860]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.940]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.580]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.780]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.900]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.780]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.860]   - So you're talking about engaging in social connection
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.220]   in real time and perhaps even in real life.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.380]   Yes, in real life as well.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.740]   With some effort to engage in it,
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.900]   which might just be built into modern living now,
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.900]   as one of the primary drivers for behavioral approaches
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.780]   to improve what we're calling happiness.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.180]   So could we say,
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.220]   and I know we don't wanna set up strict protocols
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:14.020]   around this, make the effort to schedule in real time
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:18.080]   over the phone or Zoom or in real life interaction
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.260]   with somebody maybe once a week, minimum?
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.860]   - I think more than you're doing now.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.620]   If you're not feeling so happy, add some in.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.220]   And again, as you mentioned before,
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.540]   like these are all kind of trade-offs, right?
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.740]   You don't wanna add so much in the now.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.900]   You're not sleeping or exercising or all that other stuff.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.700]   But like one more interaction than you're getting now
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.820]   and check how it feels over time.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.100]   - Given how busy people are
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.660]   and given that we've established that some effort
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.100]   that's required to engage socially
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.980]   is going to be beneficial toward the reward and all of this.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.200]   And we're not trying to hack the dopamine system here, folks.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.260]   We're just trying to figure out
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.400]   what is going to be rewarding
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.780]   given that everyone has constraints on their time
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.020]   and everyone seems to have a device in their pocket
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:01.020]   that allows them to get the illusion of nourishment
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:06.020]   that leads to either same levels or less happiness overall,
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.460]   you know, what's going to be most effective.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.780]   And it seems to me, I was thinking about this
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.220]   during one of your answers, I was paying attention,
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.100]   but I was thinking about this,
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.900]   that my memory of prior social interactions
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.020]   as really great is a useful tool.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.340]   So for instance, one of my best memories
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.620]   of time with my girlfriend
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.260]   was driving back from her grandmother's house
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.260]   with the dog in the car and we had no phone reception.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.780]   So we couldn't be interrupted by our devices.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.540]   She actually had some work to do.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.300]   So she was doing some work on her computer at one point.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.420]   She may have taken a nap at one point
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.140]   and the dog kept jumping back and forth between our laps.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.380]   And that to me, it was like one of the best days ever.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.340]   Just ever, it was just an awesome day.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.060]   That memory occurred to me now.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.480]   And I think could serve me well in thinking,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.100]   okay, so like going on a road trip with somebody,
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:04.080]   but it was the lack of kind of structure around it.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.240]   It was just imposed on us.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.540]   We had a drive to complete, there was a dog in the car,
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.940]   there was some work to do, there was no phone reception.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.660]   And you know, we've had many great interactions,
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.620]   but that would be the one that I'd highlight
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:18.620]   as like, that was an awesome interaction
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.940]   for whatever reason.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.380]   And so can one use memories of great social interaction
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:28.380]   as a compass for how to construct these social plans?
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:33.700]   Because I think it can be a little bit mystifying
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.220]   to people, like, oh, how do I get this thing
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.460]   called happiness by meeting up with a friend,
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.100]   we enjoy hiking or something like that,
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.380]   but maybe that's not accessible.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.500]   And I don't want people to underthink or overthink it.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.980]   But to me, it seems like, okay, like road trips,
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.540]   everyday things, we needed to go up there.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.020]   There was some things to tend to.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:52.580]   - So like tending to life things,
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.780]   life requirements together?
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.420]   - Yeah, I mean, if you wanna ask yourself a question
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.500]   that can highlight good memories,
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.220]   I recommend the one that the journalist
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.340]   Catherine Price uses a lot.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.120]   She does a lot of studies on fun.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.060]   Ask yourself the question, what were three times
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.800]   that you just had the most fun?
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.380]   The last three times you would describe as,
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.100]   oh my God, that was the most fun, right?
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.340]   And this is a helpful question
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.540]   because usually the answer, my guess is,
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.500]   at least two out of three, probably all three,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.120]   will have someone else in it.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.900]   Like they'll be, you'll have like another person involved
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.380]   or a dog, sometimes some other agentive being, right?
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.220]   - Oh, no, I completely agree.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.220]   - It wasn't you by yourself.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.620]   It probably didn't involve a screen, right?
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:27.460]   And so that's kind of like--
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.540]   - Definitely not.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.980]   - And that actually gets back to your road trip.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.340]   You know, talking about, I think the social part
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.620]   was really important, but it seems like that road trip
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.100]   also tapped into a sort of thought pattern
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.740]   that we know is really good for happiness,
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   which is presence, right?
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.940]   Just being kind of mindful.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.420]   You're paying attention to the dog flopping on you.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.860]   You're seeing the scenery, right?
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.580]   You're not in a rush to do something.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.780]   So your mind could kind of be on that drive
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.060]   and how it felt.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.700]   And we know so much about how kind of these moments
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:56.340]   of mindfulness, really paying attention
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.140]   to your sensory experience,
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.300]   how much that matters for happiness.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.020]   And one of the biggest hacks you can use
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.520]   to get more presence is to do exactly
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.320]   what you accidentally did driving through these parts
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.960]   of the world where you don't get phone receptions,
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.540]   which is to get rid of our phones.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.340]   You know, our phones are just like
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   the biggest attention stealers ever.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.700]   And it makes a lot of sense,
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.460]   because what grabs our attention?
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.780]   Things that are really interesting
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.100]   and provide a little glass of quick dopamine hits, right?
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.260]   Or just kind of scream at us with information
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.780]   and announcements and so on.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.420]   This is what our phones do really well.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.540]   And our brains aren't stupid.
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.660]   Our brains know that on the other side of our phone
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.500]   is like such rewarding content.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.900]   And it becomes, you know, really distracting.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.980]   My colleague, Liz Dunn, has this kind of analogy
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.020]   she uses that is like, you know, imagine, you know,
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.500]   instead of this kind of conversation we're having right here
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.580]   or maybe I'll do with my husband at a dinner party
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.100]   where I'm sitting with my husband at dinner
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.060]   and we're chatting and I have my phone out.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.060]   And my husband's a philosopher, he's a very smart guy.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.100]   We have great conversations.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.740]   But I know on the other end of that phone
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.660]   is like really interesting stuff.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.940]   And Liz said, imagine the comparison
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.700]   is instead of having your phone there,
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.820]   I had this big wheelbarrow next to me and my husband
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.900]   at our dinner table.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.540]   And in that wheelbarrow was photo albums
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.320]   of every photo I've taken since 2016,
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.500]   physical printouts of my emails and news articles
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.940]   and stuff that I could get, you know,
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:19.140]   like videotapes of cat videos and porn and everything.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.900]   It's like piled up really high in this wheelbarrow.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.100]   If we were trying to have a conversation,
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:23.980]   that wheelbarrow was there.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.260]   I'd be like, oh, I just wanna take a quick look at the photo
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.100]   or do something.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:27.920]   It'd be so distracting.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.380]   It'd be so interesting.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.300]   Your brain's not stupid.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.700]   Your brain knows even though your phone
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.220]   is much tinier than that wheelbarrow
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.820]   that all that interesting dopamine rich exciting stuff
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:37.820]   is on it.
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.380]   And it makes it hard to pay attention to my husband.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.640]   Again, an interesting philosopher.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.040]   We have great conversations.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.760]   And so there's lots of evidence showing
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.300]   that even the act of having your phone out
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.460]   is subtly stealing your attention from other people,
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.240]   from the tasks that you're doing.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.120]   One of the biggest pieces of advice I give my college
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.020]   students is to study without your phone near you
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.720]   because Princeton studies have looked at this
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.800]   where you have somebody do say a math test
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.200]   or a studying test with your phone there
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.840]   versus the phone in the other room.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.320]   And you see like double digit increases in performance
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.880]   just to have your phone away.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.400]   And you might ask, well, why would that be?
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.120]   It's like, well, part of your frontal lobe is like,
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.160]   no, no, no, don't look at the phone.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:14.980]   Don't look at the phone.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.820]   Don't look at that big wheelbarrow
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.800]   of delicious interesting stuff.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.920]   Stay on task.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.760]   And that's this kind of constant moment of multitasking
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.160]   where we're kind of yanking our brain back onto task.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.840]   And so a big hack if you want to be more present
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.120]   is to find ways to do activities without your phone.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.720]   I guess if we go back to that fun question,
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.140]   if I said those three times you're having the most fun,
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.080]   you weren't in the middle of it pulling out your phone
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.600]   to look at your Instagram feed.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.140]   You were just there.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.520]   And what you just described
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.520]   was a dramatic performance enhancement on mathematics
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.200]   by not having this opportunity
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.040]   for distraction in the room, which is incredible.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.860]   - Yeah, I mean, when you look,
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.320]   when you dive deep into the effects
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.160]   of having your phone around you, they're striking.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.840]   Especially in getting back to social connection,
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.000]   especially social connection.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Liz Dunn has this paper where she puts two people in a room,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.160]   just kind of a waiting room together.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.680]   And you either have your phone or you don't.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.840]   You're not allowed to look at it.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.040]   It's just present.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.480]   And she finds that there's 30% less smiling
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.920]   at the other people in the waiting room
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.000]   when your phones are present, 30% less.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   I mean, I actually think of this
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.600]   when I think of the loneliness crisis.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.400]   I walk, I was a head of college on campus,
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.800]   which as a faculty member at Yale
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.000]   meant that I lived on campus with students.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.600]   And you'd walk through the courtyard
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.580]   and everybody's walking through the courtyard,
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.420]   but they're not looking at you.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.520]   They're looking down at their phone, right?
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.960]   There's these like subtle interactions that we're missing
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.840]   because our phone is stealing us.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.240]   That's the social case.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.600]   But I think there's a real performance case too, right?
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.200]   If you wanna pay attention and learn something,
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.720]   if part of your brain is inhibiting that urge
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.780]   to look at all the interesting stuff on your phone,
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.680]   which we don't notice,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.480]   then that's gonna be affecting your performance.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.440]   Has good benefits too.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.480]   There's this lovely finding that people are buying less gum
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.520]   and less candy in checkout aisles now,
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.020]   that like the national worldwide sale of gum has gone down
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.400]   and it's gone down on the same slope
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.840]   as the iPhones have gone up.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.840]   So as number of iPhones in pockets goes up,
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.820]   sales of gum in checkout lines has gone down.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.660]   And you can see why that is.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.080]   - They're not looking around as much.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.800]   - You're not looking like, ooh, that, you know,
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.160]   like double mitt looks really good.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.880]   You're staring at your phone and looking at your Instagram.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.120]   - Soon the ads are gonna pop up on,
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.200]   they'll know you're in the aisle
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.120]   'cause they can know you have proximity to a lot of devices.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.660]   I have a friend who's a very accomplished songwriter
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.840]   and musician and someone does his Instagram
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.600]   and other social media for him.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.840]   He's not on there.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.080]   And we met for dinner the other day
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.240]   with a couple other people.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.140]   And I got there and I started telling him
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:44.440]   about something I had seen online.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.960]   And he said, I won't use it.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.240]   I usually will do his voice, but I won't do his voice
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.680]   'cause I don't wanna give it away.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.080]   People might know who he is.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   But he said, I don't wanna talk about what's on Instagram.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.440]   In fact, I don't wanna talk about what's on the internet.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.800]   Let's just have dinner.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.600]   And at first I was like, dude, I was like,
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.080]   and I thought, great, he's exactly right.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.640]   Like, it's not just having the phone there.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.240]   It's not just being on the device.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.040]   It's also that you're talking about things
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.360]   that you saw in the world,
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.360]   some of which are very interesting and important at times.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.720]   But what he was saying was,
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.680]   I don't wanna talk about things that you experienced
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.480]   about somebody else's experience.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.560]   That wasn't really an experience that you had today.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.040]   That's an experience of someone else's experience
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.560]   that you had today.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.160]   It wasn't about a news article or something.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.720]   So we're playing the telephone bucket brigade game
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.320]   of social connection many, many degrees away
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.640]   from the actual interactions
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.600]   that we were kind of hardwired to experience ourselves.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.680]   - And those are the ones that really influence
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.920]   our happiness in the world, right?
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.340]   You know, one of the great ways to increase your presence
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.140]   in addition to kind of getting rid of your phone
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.600]   is to just go back to your senses, right?
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.480]   What are you looking at right now?
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.400]   What do you see right now?
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.220]   I'm in this room.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.720]   There's like really nice kind of cool black lighting
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.560]   and I'm sitting there.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.440]   I'm hearing your voice.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.300]   There's like a subtle hum in the room
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.760]   that I hope the podcast is not picking up
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.800]   that I hear in the audio, right?
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.240]   It's a little cool.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.940]   That grounding, I can watch my breath
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.360]   completely change around.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.480]   It's like a quick way to just kind of be embodied.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.000]   And I think so often we're just not doing that as much,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.160]   you know, in our discourse,
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.460]   but definitely like even when we're by ourselves,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.580]   you know, we just wind up distracting ourselves
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.220]   from the very sensory experience
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.940]   that like literally is the experience
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.960]   that we have of the world.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.140]   We're just not noticing it as much.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.420]   - Now, I will say that a memory
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.440]   of a really terrific time I had alone
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.780]   was around this time of year, actually, around the holidays.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:55.300]   Typically, I would be in my office organizing papers,
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:59.120]   maybe dealing with some end of year stuff for academics.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.420]   You know, my life's a lot different now with the podcast,
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.420]   even though I still teach at Stanford,
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.500]   but end of year is a time
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.180]   when you kind of get your office organized
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.060]   and everyone, every academic knows this.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.880]   And over the holidays,
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.640]   I tended to have a lot of time in my office alone.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.980]   It was a great time to come in.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.180]   Like parking was everywhere.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.660]   You go in and I used to listen to Ted Talks
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.980]   or I would listen to podcasts.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.420]   And these days I'm trying to do more physical things,
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.500]   not just exercise,
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.620]   but I'm working on some like lighting stuff in my house.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.680]   And I like to listen to podcasts or books,
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.520]   sometimes music,
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.280]   but podcasts or books while I do that.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.320]   And I do feel that when we're alone,
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.600]   sometimes it's nice to have other voices in the room
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.280]   that are not just the voices in our head.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.920]   And it could be music, podcasts, books, movies, et cetera,
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.880]   that people seem to find that soothing.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.120]   I certainly do.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.720]   And that doesn't feel like it's diminishing
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.360]   from my experience of being present.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.000]   In fact, it allows me to just really tend
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.020]   to what I'm doing mechanically.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.980]   - And I have some plans to do some more like
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:00.920]   craft drawing type projects in the new year.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.140]   And I look forward to being able to hear those conversations
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.580]   but not have to participate in them.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.660]   - So would you consider that sort of healthy
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.780]   or am I diminishing my experience
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.740]   and the depth of my crafts?
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:16.700]   - Yeah, well, I think there's some nuance there, right?
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.220]   You're talking about your craft in a very embodied way.
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.300]   Even as you're talking to me,
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.860]   you're describing how your hands are moving
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.480]   in these motor ways as you're doing it.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.940]   You're talking about kind of what it felt like.
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.740]   It felt like your senses were activated
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.980]   for the physical stuff you were doing.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.980]   But you also mentioned that your mind was wandering
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.660]   and maybe you're ruminating and stuff like that.
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.900]   So it sounds like what you did
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.300]   was have a really nice emotion regulation strategy
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.820]   of like you could kind of fill your head with something
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.300]   so that you can work on the physical stuff.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.880]   But it didn't impede your experience of the physical stuff.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.580]   The way you described it shows that you were there,
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.140]   you were present when you were doing it.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.260]   I think the problem is when it impedes
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.540]   our presence doing it.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.780]   And I think it kind of depends on the activity we're doing.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.720]   Take driving.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   Probably some of you who are listening right now
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.440]   are sitting in your car as you're driving,
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.720]   doing this other interesting motoric activity.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.280]   And that's one where it's like,
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.360]   you're not missing out on that much on the drive
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.400]   by like listening to us.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.800]   It's probably a positive kind of experience
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.300]   that you're having, learning something and so on.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.800]   But you wouldn't wanna listen to podcasts
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.040]   in some physical situations, right?
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.320]   If you're a ballroom dancing, for example,
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.640]   you wouldn't wanna necessarily be listening
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.680]   to a podcast then, right?
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.560]   If you're really experiencing art
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.840]   and sort of engaging with art in an art gallery,
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.760]   you wouldn't wanna also be listening to a podcast
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.600]   at the same time.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.920]   And so I think the thing to think is,
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.040]   are you listening to this in a way
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.400]   that you're missing something in the real world
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.880]   that your presence of it would matter,
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.800]   make you feel really good?
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.760]   Or are you kind of just like killing some other free time
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.740]   and maybe using this as a nice emotion regulation strategy
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.740]   to stop what would otherwise be a really ruminative drive.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.360]   Now you get to listen to me and Andrew
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.560]   and that's probably better.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.920]   But there's nuance there.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.500]   I think our tendency is to move away from the rumination,
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.640]   is to run away from it.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.680]   And I think if you find yourself
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.080]   kind of avoiding your thought patterns altogether,
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.960]   that probably might be the pendulum swinging
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.000]   a little too far in the other direction.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.480]   - Noted. - Noted.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.840]   - So we've got in real time and or in real life,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.360]   well, in real life is always in real time,
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.780]   but in real life and or in real time social interaction,
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.020]   and if it requires some effort to plan or get to,
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.460]   organize all the better.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.380]   You stand to gain more from those interactions.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.900]   So that's really key presence, obviously,
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:32.300]   try and get the phone out of the room,
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.740]   at least off and put away, but ideally out of sight.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.180]   - Out of sight. - Out of sight, love that.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:43.060]   And shared experience, presumably,
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.920]   actually maybe doing something,
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.420]   but it could even just be talking.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.100]   I guess it depends on what people enjoy doing, right?
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.420]   So these are powerful levers
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.420]   for shifting one level of happiness up using behavior.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:59.380]   What about leading with thought patterns or feelings?
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.700]   Seems like it's a more challenging,
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.060]   but certainly tractable entry point.
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.740]   - Yeah, and I think it's important here to remember,
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:10.340]   like, what are our natural evolutionary patterns
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.380]   towards thought patterns?
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.100]   'Cause some of them aren't necessarily built
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:14.980]   for our happiness.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.860]   You know, take what's a kind of common
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.060]   evolutionary thought pattern,
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.140]   which is a negativity bias, right?
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.840]   We're just built to notice all the scary stuff,
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.140]   all the bad stuff, all the potentially risky stuff,
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.980]   our brains instantly go there.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.100]   And that makes fabulous evolutionary sense.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.820]   Like if there's a possibility that there's a tiger
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.220]   that's gonna jump out or some sort of risky thing,
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.340]   you want your brain to lock onto it.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.400]   Not as evolutionary beneficial to notice
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.540]   all the blessings in life, just all the good things.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:42.380]   It doesn't really give you that much of a survival benefit
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.480]   to notice, hey, there's the absence of a tiger,
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.500]   we don't really know, there's no tigers around, right?
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   - In fact, it probably helps drive more motivation
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.020]   to go pursue resources.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.060]   I mean, you could imagine an adaptive feature
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.840]   to lacking satisfaction.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.920]   I mean, you'd gain more resources in a time
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.700]   where resources were presumably shared more
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.180]   in these small village formats.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.580]   I don't know, do monkey troops share resources?
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.060]   - It depends on the monkey.
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:08.900]   - Depends on the monkey.
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.820]   Just like humans, depends on the humans.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.300]   Depends on the monkey.
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:15.040]   But I think you're making a really critical point, right?
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.460]   Which is like, if we're noticing the negative,
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.640]   if we're noticing the bad stuff, we tend to fix it.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.140]   But also if we're craving, if we're wanting,
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.820]   if we're kind of constantly in search of something,
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.540]   we get off our butts and go do stuff, right?
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.860]   - I mean, Steve Jobs in his parting words
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:31.260]   were stay hungry, stay foolish.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.580]   Maybe it was stay foolish, stay hungry,
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:34.500]   but stay hungry was definitely in there.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.580]   And I realize he's not going to represent the epitome
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.220]   of what to strive for for everybody,
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:41.740]   but he certainly held up as somebody who changed the world
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.480]   through the development of certain technologies.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.980]   So we revere these people that are hungry for more.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.740]   - Yeah. - Right.
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.860]   - And it makes great evolutionary sense.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.580]   Doesn't make as good happiness sense, right?
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.260]   What's one of the best ways to be happy?
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.980]   To just appreciate what you have,
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:01.580]   to notice and appreciate the blessings out there.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.380]   But we got to push against this natural negativity bias
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.220]   to do this.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.060]   So how do we do that?
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.300]   Well, it turns out that this is a spot
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.700]   where harnessing attention
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:09.900]   and the way we were just talking about
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.420]   can be really helpful.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.780]   Just taking time to notice the blessings,
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.020]   notice kind of all the good stuff.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.280]   It's often talked about in terms of a gratitude practice.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.500]   Although gratitude sounds kind of cheesy, I don't know.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.800]   My friend, Catherine Price, who I mentioned earlier,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.140]   she has this practice that she calls a delight practice.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.620]   We just noticed delights in the world.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.780]   - I love the word delight.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.340]   - You know, I walked in your studio,
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.860]   you had a picture of your bulldog
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:32.940]   and I was like, that's a delight.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.780]   That's so cute.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.100]   - Thank you for delighting in him.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.100]   I delight in him too,
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.880]   even though he's dead several years now.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.280]   Delight is a wonderful word.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.660]   - Yeah, and we can train our brain to notice them, right?
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.820]   You can literally have a practice
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.280]   where put in your notes app on your phone,
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.420]   like list of delights or even better,
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.900]   pick a friend like I have with Catherine
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.620]   where you can just like text them delight.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:52.460]   You know, at the end of this,
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.740]   I'll text like saw a really cute dog, delight,
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.580]   or heard this really funny song, delight.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.540]   Then you get the social connection and the gratitude.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.940]   But what that does is if you have this practice
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.700]   where you got to write down the delights,
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.180]   your brain starts to automatically
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.160]   be on the lookout for them.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.220]   It becomes rewarding
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.940]   'cause you get to write this thing down.
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.780]   Now, all of a sudden it can be a practice
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.460]   that you're sort of shifting your negativity bias
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.100]   to notice more of the good things that are out there.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.660]   And there's so much evidence suggesting
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.420]   that people who naturally notice the blessings
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.500]   in the world are happier.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.320]   If you do one of these kind of gratitude
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.100]   or delight practices, you wind up happier.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.700]   Sonia Lubomirsky has this lovely study
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.680]   where you scribble down three to five things
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.640]   you're grateful for, three to five delights.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.660]   In as little as two weeks,
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:33.060]   you significantly improve your overall satisfaction
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:33.900]   with life, right?
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:34.980]   - I love that. - Super free.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:38.100]   - So much so that, and because I accidentally interrupted,
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.740]   the comments always tell me I interrupt too much.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.780]   It's out of interest, it's out of interest, I promise.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.440]   If I could interrupt myself, I would,
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.220]   and I probably do from time to time.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.660]   Could you repeat what the, it's three to five things?
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.060]   - Yeah, three to five things you're grateful for.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:50.640]   I'm not sure if the number really matters,
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.100]   but it's committing to kind of noticing
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.460]   the good things in life
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.100]   and really trying to take a moment
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.860]   to notice how they felt, right?
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.020]   So if I look at, I do delight practices sometimes
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.060]   or gratitude practices, and it's things like,
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.960]   my husband, these big things in life.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.740]   But then sometimes it's like, my morning coffee,
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.460]   or probably seeing your cute dog.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:08.900]   It's funny to see the picture of the,
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.980]   for folks that don't know Andrew Studio,
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.100]   it's a picture of his dog on a microphone.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.100]   It's just very funny.
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.700]   It's a giant microphone. - Giant, high quality
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.540]   photograph. - Yes, it's great.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.580]   - He was actually standing on the table
[01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:22.180]   that I do my solo podcasts from at the microphone,
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:25.140]   and his tag just happened to rotate a few degrees
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.740]   toward the camera just at that moment,
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.020]   so you could see his name, Costello, you know?
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.780]   - And I invite listeners to pause right now
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.580]   and notice what's happening to their face
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.500]   as you hear Andrew say that.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.860]   Probably you're just smiling, right?
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.820]   You didn't even see this really cute photo,
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:39.940]   but you're also smiling.
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.500]   That's the power of delights, right?
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.060]   Not just noticing them yourself,
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:45.060]   but potentially sharing them too.
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.340]   And so this is another thought pattern practice
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.120]   that we can engage in, which is like,
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.980]   just train your brain to find these things.
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:54.380]   And what you'll find is that there's a limited ratio
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.860]   of the stuff we can focus our attention on.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.980]   If we start shifting towards the delights
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.740]   from the hassles and the yucky stuff in life,
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.420]   now we're just kind of filling our brain with stuff
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.640]   that gives us a little more positive emotion.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.820]   - What I love about this conversation about gratitude
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.220]   is that, I must say, I do like the word delight
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.060]   more than gratitude.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.100]   - Gratitude sounds cheesy.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.980]   It sounds a little hippie-dippie, I gotta say, yeah.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:15.420]   - Well, I'm from Northern California,
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.060]   so I'm cool with hippie-dippie, even though I'm not a hippie.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.700]   I'm a punk rocker, not a hippie.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.460]   - You're Berkeley roots, sir.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.820]   - Yeah, I know, I'm from the other end of the peninsula.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.940]   I love the East Bay, but anyway, this is getting...
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:30.540]   But the point is, it's not that the word feels soft.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.860]   I need to think about this a little bit more.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.080]   It's that maybe it's just that delight
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.280]   is such a powerful, unselfish word.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.760]   Like it's not taking anything from anybody.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.720]   It's not requiring a shift away
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.080]   from one's sort of intrinsic self.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.400]   I feel like gratitude requires this like,
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.680]   okay, I'm gonna now be grateful.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.840]   It's kind of like pulling...
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.740]   If you're not already in a state of gratitude,
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:58.520]   I feel like there's more effort involved.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.240]   And we've been saying effort that precedes reward is good.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.720]   But with delight, it feels like it's just very much
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.740]   in concert with almost like who one is.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.580]   - Yeah.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.440]   - You know, and like I delight in Costello.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.520]   I don't expect everyone to delight in Costello.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.200]   People who did, I delighted in their delight.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.760]   So it was just, you know, amplifying all the delight.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.360]   But the thing that really strikes me about delight
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.200]   is that every example you gave,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.640]   it's very rapid timescale.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.400]   Like you, you know, like I will say,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.560]   I normally drink yerba mate during these things,
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.400]   which I delight in.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.000]   But today I decided I haven't had a coffee in a while,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.040]   took a little break from it for no particular reason.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.200]   And I had a single shot of espresso
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.920]   and I was thinking to myself, this is really good.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.760]   - This is delightful.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.120]   - So this is a fast timescale.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.420]   Maybe it was the fact that I haven't had it
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.320]   in a little while.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:49.320]   And it's just really fast.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.200]   No one suffers.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.520]   It's all gain.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.360]   And so it runs a little bit countercurrent
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.520]   to what we were talking about before,
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.760]   which is the requirement for effort to precede the reward.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.000]   Delight feels like a very smooth road
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.800]   to a reward that's all net positive.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.280]   And as you said, these delights are available
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.240]   throughout the day.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.640]   And it doesn't, it requires just noticing something
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.840]   inside and outside.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.600]   Whereas I feel like with gratitude,
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.940]   I love gratitude practices.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.320]   The data are incredible.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.920]   It is anything but squishy.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.760]   There's like a real power tool for shifting
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.960]   one's state of mind.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.560]   That's clear from the literature.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.640]   But the gratitude thing, I feel like requires
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.660]   an almost like a formalization.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.920]   Like, okay, I'm gonna be grateful now.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.500]   Whereas delight, you're just kind of on the lookout
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:40.040]   for things that spark you and make you reflexively smile.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:40.880]   - Yeah.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.440]   - And the few things are better than that.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.280]   - Yeah.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.640]   And I think it's really sensory,
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.000]   in the way we were talking about before, right?
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.440]   It gets you back into being present.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.800]   Most of these delights are something you taste
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.720]   or you experience or you see that's funny.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.040]   There's a really lovely book by the author Ross Gay
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.280]   called "The Book of Delights."
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.800]   And he used a delight practice where every day
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.100]   he not only had to find a delight,
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.800]   but write a short essay about it 'cause he's an author.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.240]   And it's just hilarious.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.920]   It's like one of my favorite books.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.080]   And you just kind of go, and it's really strange things.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.540]   It's like, one is he, you know, notice the flowers,
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.560]   he notices lilacs.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:14.520]   And he has this whole idea of, one delay is purple flowers.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.960]   Why are there so many purple flowers?
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.560]   There's purple flowers everywhere.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.880]   He also has a delight in music.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.440]   He really likes the '80s band, El Debarge, you know,
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.340]   from "The Beat of the Rhythm" and whatnot, yeah.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.180]   - I'm vaguely familiar with it.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.560]   - So it's like, and he talks about his love of Debarge.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.120]   And you can kind of have this connection
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.280]   with other people's delights.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.360]   And it's silly, they're just silly things.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.520]   But the fact that we've noticed them, I mean, again,
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.080]   as a listener is probably experiencing right now,
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.840]   if you pay attention, a little bit of positive emotion,
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.640]   right, if you're driving around your car,
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.000]   feeling a little stressed out in traffic,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.160]   you can kind of take a breath.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.440]   And so that's the power of the practice.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.780]   You're shifting your emotions
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.520]   'cause you're noticing these good things.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   You're noticing the good things, which is great,
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.880]   'cause you're sort of training your attention to get there.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.400]   And you're sort of forming this habit
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.800]   to shift that negativity bias that's sort of built in,
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.960]   but isn't really making you as happy as you could be.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.160]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.680]   and thank one of our sponsors, David.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.360]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.160]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.920]   only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.920]   That's right, 28 grams of protein
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.800]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.880]   These bars from David also taste amazing.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.160]   My favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.640]   But then again, I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.120]   and I also like the cake flavored one.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.960]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.480]   They're incredibly delicious.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.480]   For me personally, I strive to eat mostly whole foods.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.360]   However, when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home,
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.360]   or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack,
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.560]   I often find that I'm looking
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.720]   for a high quality protein source.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.120]   With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.840]   with the calories of a snack,
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.880]   which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.280]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.600]   And it allows me to do that
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.600]   without taking in excess calories.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.880]   I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.120]   or even mid afternoon,
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.880]   if I wanna bridge that gap between lunch and dinner.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.160]   I like that it's a little bit sweet,
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.660]   so it tastes like a tasty snack,
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.600]   but it's also given me that 28 grams
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.000]   of very high quality protein with just 150 calories.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.400]   If you would like to try David,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.720]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.800]   Again, the link is davidprotein.com/huberman.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:22.680]   I've long been interested in shifting one's emotions
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.880]   and when that feels good,
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.640]   when it is good and when it doesn't feel good.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:34.120]   I asked our friend, Ethan Cross about this too.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.680]   I'm not gonna compare your answers
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.200]   as a template for who's right, who's wrong.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.740]   I think there are a lot of differing opinions on this,
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:45.400]   but I know from the time we are young kids,
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.840]   we don't like to be shifted.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.180]   We don't like people to impose
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.120]   an emotional requirement on us.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.720]   In fact, my niece, when she was little,
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.700]   I was telling her this, she's 18 now, she was not amused,
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.200]   which delighted me that she was not amused,
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.420]   but when she was little,
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:05.160]   she was a pretty healthily stubborn kid
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.840]   and you'd ask her to do anything.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.240]   Like, "Hey, let's go downstairs for a walk."
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.560]   And she loved going outside for walks
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.920]   and she'd say, "No, push me."
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.000]   And then she would get her stuff
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:14.840]   and then you'd go for a walk.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.600]   But I loved her, like, "No, push me."
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.680]   I love this.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.000]   Costello was like, "Don't push me, you couldn't."
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.600]   So there was this immediate vocalization
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.440]   from the time she could speak, really.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.760]   I was like, "No, I'm gonna decide how I feel."
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.600]   Such a healthy thing too, such a healthy thing.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.000]   "You're not gonna shift me."
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.680]   I was like, "We're going out for a walk, it's gonna be fun."
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.200]   And she's like, "No, push me."
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.820]   And then she'd go for the walk.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.400]   Most of the times it was a fun walk.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.920]   But I think that we don't like to be shifted.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.640]   And in some ways we don't really like to shift ourselves.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.660]   Like, when we're in a given emotion,
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:51.540]   when people are feeling upset,
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.600]   they don't wanna be told they should feel happy.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.440]   - Yeah.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.120]   - And yet no one really wants to be upset.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.040]   Although there's this, do you know this result?
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.440]   I don't wanna spin off into a long discussion about this,
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.600]   but Robert Heath, a very controversial neurosurgeon
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.840]   from the '70s and '80s, did these experiments
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.840]   of stimulating in different parts of the brain,
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.560]   allowing people to self-stimulate
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.880]   different parts of their brain.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.640]   And there were only three subjects,
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.360]   'cause it's an in vivo human neurostimulation experiment.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.200]   All three subjects, by far, their favorite area
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.520]   to stimulate was this midline central nucleus,
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.720]   midline thalamic nucleus, rather.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.560]   All three of them reported that the sensation
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.680]   that they would lever press the most for
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.080]   was frustration and mild anger.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:36.920]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.080]   - Humans like that shit.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.120]   - Yeah. - Excuse my language.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.200]   - No, no, no. - Why?
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.160]   - Look, the horror movie industry would not exist
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.720]   if we didn't like fear, right?
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.800]   Honestly, like Twitter X, whatever we're calling it now,
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.320]   would not exist if we didn't like outrage, right?
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.480]   These are kind of complicated negative emotions
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.800]   that have some positive benefit to us.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.440]   And I think that this is something that people get wrong
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.040]   when they hear my line of research.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.560]   You know, I tell people, like, oh, I teach this class
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.160]   about happiness at Yale, and people will say like,
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.160]   oh, you just want everybody to be happy.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.120]   You sort of embrace this toxic positivity.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.200]   And I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.320]   - Toxic positivity? - Toxic positivity, yeah.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.560]   It's this idea, I mean, you kind of see it
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.440]   in our culture right now.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.520]   It's the sort of good vibes only, right?
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.560]   It's this idea that anything that feels mildly frustrating
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:24.600]   or hard to do, it's like, oh, no, no, don't do that.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.360]   It's like good vibes only, right?
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.040]   And there's this idea that if you're experiencing
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.280]   negative emotions, if you feel sad
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.560]   or you feel a little lonely
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.320]   or you feel a little upset at politics,
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.560]   whatever it is, that something's wrong,
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.440]   or you gotta take a pill
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.560]   or you gotta do something to fix it, right?
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.800]   I think that's a really dangerous idea, right?
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.560]   Because it's getting rid of this signal
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.160]   that we've been built to experience evolutionarily
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.400]   that's really important, right?
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.240]   If you're experiencing outrage,
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.240]   that's telling you something super crucial.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.920]   If you're experiencing kind of frustration,
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.200]   overwhelm is a big one.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.800]   If you're kind of feeling, oh, I'm so overwhelmed at work
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.040]   and I'm burned out, that's a really useful signal
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.040]   about behavioral changes you should make.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.480]   In class, I often tell my students
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.000]   that negative emotions are like that dashboard on your car.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.280]   You go in your car and you're like,
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.960]   sometimes you're driving, the tire light comes on
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.400]   or the engine light comes on.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.320]   And that's a pain in the ass, honestly,
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.160]   'cause you're like, well, I gotta deal with it.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.120]   So it's not fun when these lights come on,
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.640]   but it's super useful information
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.800]   that if you actively ignore it for months and months
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.360]   is gonna cause a much bigger problem later on.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.480]   And I think this is how all of our negative emotions work.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.880]   If you're feeling that negative emotion of loneliness,
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.160]   means you need more social connection.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.240]   If you're feeling overwhelmed,
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.480]   it means probably gotta take something off your plate
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.240]   before you burn out or get sick.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.520]   If you're feeling sad,
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:43.000]   that's probably because of some stimulus that matters
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]   that is like, you're not there anymore.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.360]   If you're feeling grief and so on,
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.080]   I think too often we just wanna get rid of those.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.120]   We don't like them, so we wanna suppress those emotions.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.680]   But suppressing our emotions
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.120]   is giving up useful evolutionary information
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.400]   that probably means we can take action
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.440]   to fix and feel better.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.120]   - Americans might be surprised to hear this,
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.440]   but I learned this from my father
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.720]   who's from South America, he's from Argentina,
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.880]   went to British schools when he was young.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.840]   And he told me when I was probably 10 or 12,
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.080]   I can't remember exactly how old,
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:18.080]   he said, in the British formal school system,
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.480]   if you act too happy, people accuse you of being stupid.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.600]   To be gleeful or happy.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.320]   And I said, now I would say,
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.080]   well, they're perfectly fine being happy
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:30.920]   when they're drinking.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:35.160]   I will say that the after work alcohol culture in London.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.600]   - 5.00 to 14.00 p.m. crowd.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.440]   - They drink a lot.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.320]   I don't know if it's still the case, but they drink a lot.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.560]   And then they get very outwardly happy.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.720]   But there's this idea,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.480]   and this was true when I came into academia,
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.120]   that if somebody wasn't super serious,
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.440]   that they might be stupid.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.400]   And I think in the United States now,
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.520]   we tend to celebrate more expressions of glee.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.320]   But that's usually in the context of celebrity and wealth.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.080]   Like these people getting on their private planes
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.000]   or something.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.920]   But I think there's still some elements to this
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.800]   that we internalize.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.640]   That if you're happy,
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.400]   that you're not worrying about something.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.440]   If you're not worrying about something,
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.360]   then you're ignoring the woes of the world.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.640]   Maybe even the threats that are all around you.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.040]   And so in some ways,
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.720]   we are conditioned to always wanna be happy.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.040]   That does seem to be one message.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.760]   But then we also get the conflicting message
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:29.720]   that to be happy is to be ignorant
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.760]   of what's really happening,
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.280]   if not to you, then to other people.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.280]   And therefore, you're not fulfilling your role in society.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.200]   So who are you to be happy all the time?
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.920]   There's a lot of judgment written into this thing
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.280]   around happiness, I'm realizing.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.120]   - Yeah, totally.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.840]   And I think you're bringing up something
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.240]   that I actually worry about a lot, right?
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.600]   Which is, is that hypothesis correct?
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.840]   Is it the case that if you're feeling happy,
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.280]   you just ignore the woes
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.320]   and all the terrible stuff in the world?
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.200]   Because then I'm creating a whole generation
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.560]   of Yale students who are gonna not fix
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.080]   the bad problems of life.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.400]   And so it turns out there's a researcher
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.760]   at Georgetown, Konstantin Kuchlev, who's tested this.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.320]   He actually asked the question,
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.480]   is it the case that people who are experiencing
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.580]   more positive emotion, more satisfaction with life,
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.160]   do they ignore the problems of the world and not act?
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.520]   Or are they the ones kind of going out and doing stuff?
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.720]   And so he did this in a couple different contexts.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.200]   He looked for social justice causes.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.360]   I'll tell the climate version.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.400]   So he looked at how many people are taking climate action.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.520]   So do you go to a protest?
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.600]   Do you put solar panels on?
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.800]   Are you donating money to climate causes?
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.480]   And he finds that the people who are really climate anxious,
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.480]   they tend to have less positive emotions.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.000]   You're really worried about climate change.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.640]   You tend to be more on the depressed, anxious side.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.400]   But if you're doing stuff about it,
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.360]   then you tend to have more positive emotion.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.480]   I think he assumes the causal arrow goes in the other way,
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.200]   that if you're happier,
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.960]   if you're experiencing lots of delights and positive emotion,
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.880]   you kind of have the bandwidth to do stuff, right?
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.120]   You can go to that protest,
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.160]   where if you're super depressed,
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.000]   you're just gonna lie in bed with your duvet.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.920]   You don't have the bandwidth to do this stuff.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.160]   And so this whole kind of like Pollyanna-ish hypothesis
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.080]   about happiness, it makes complete intuitive sense.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.360]   But if you look at the data, it's actually the opposite,
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.560]   which is a good thing,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:04.040]   because I think it gives us a mandate not to stay depressed
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.080]   about everything in the world,
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.440]   pissed off about what's happening.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.760]   Yes, those negative emotions are good to notice
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.200]   and experience and act on,
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.040]   but we can take care of ourselves and it's okay.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.040]   It doesn't mean we're gonna stop doing good stuff
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.560]   in the world.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:19.000]   - I have a family member, she's wonderful.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.320]   She saves animals constantly,
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.280]   and she knows that she has an excessive number of animals,
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.400]   but she's from the East Coast, she's from New Jersey.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.200]   And the other day she told me, she goes,
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.480]   "You know, I like your podcast,
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.540]   "but sometimes you'll have these guests on
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.980]   "that are clearly from the West Coast,
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:34.240]   "and you guys get into this real like
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.080]   "West Coast, California, squishy stuff,
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.520]   "and I just can't listen to those."
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.720]   And I said, I won't say her name for sake of privacy,
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.760]   but she said, "But you know, I really like it when,
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.580]   "even if the topic is about something kind of squishy,
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:50.060]   "if the person's from the East Coast,
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.400]   "then like, you know, like, I believe what they're saying."
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.560]   And I said, and she goes, "Yeah, you know, out there,
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.460]   "you're into this and that."
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.240]   And I said, "Well, out there in New Jersey,
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.880]   "you know, language is kind of a weapon."
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.640]   She goes, "It's absolutely a weapon," you know?
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:04.240]   So I do think there are these even local cultural things,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.880]   like people from the Midwest, to me,
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.280]   I don't wanna, you know, stereotype,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.560]   but there's a, every time I go to the Midwest,
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.640]   I must say that there's an etiquette,
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.160]   people are just so polite and kind.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.280]   So the level of, sort of mean level of decency
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.920]   is much higher than it is, say, in California.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.800]   In California, there's some other things that are wonderful
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.920]   that are lacking elsewhere,
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.200]   and on the East Coast and so forth.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.200]   But yeah, I think one can overgeneralize,
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.920]   but I think that the reason I raise this
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.120]   is that maybe we all need to pay a little bit of attention
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.440]   to the messages that we internalized in our family,
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.720]   in our culture growing up,
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.260]   and ask ourselves whether or not our degree of happiness
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:46.960]   or lack thereof is, you know, by some programming,
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.520]   literally social programming that we've internalized.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.560]   'Cause I grew up in a home where
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.120]   cynical humor was rewarded,
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.200]   and I've learned over the years,
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.600]   in part through discussions with Jameel Zaki and others,
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:02.760]   like I'm working on it, not all my humor is cynical,
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.400]   but I don't like cynicism.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.360]   It bums me out, it doesn't feel good.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.040]   And I realize it doesn't feel good.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.640]   I love delight, but I don't like cynicism.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.480]   That's just me.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.740]   And for the cynics out there, like, cool, you do you.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:18.540]   But I think we have to pay attention
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.940]   to kind of like where our set point is with this stuff.
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:24.740]   'Cause some people are like sitting real in the no push me,
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.720]   and they wanna be unhappy, right?
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.820]   We're heading up on the holidays here,
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:30.420]   so like Scrooge, right?
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.220]   And other people, they're not feeling good,
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.060]   they wanna be happy,
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.500]   and then other people really are just like no worries.
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.100]   I mean, down in Australia, it's all no worries.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:40.300]   And what do they say in Costa Rica?
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.920]   - Oh, pura vida, yeah.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:42.760]   - Which means?
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.240]   - It's like the good life, chill life.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.400]   - Everyone's just telling each other
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.120]   how great life should be all day long.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:48.960]   - Yeah.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.600]   Yeah, I mean, I think you're getting
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.040]   at a really important issue, right?
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.600]   Which is like, do we have a happiness set point?
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.160]   And kind of, if we do, where does it come from, right?
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.560]   In your example, kind of growing up cynically
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.000]   and having these cynical messages,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.760]   it could be that that was some sort of
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.240]   maybe epigenetic thing, right?
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.480]   You're around all these people that are cynical
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.680]   and you learn how to do it, right?
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.520]   But it could be more of the genetic side.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.580]   Maybe there's some pre-programmed sense
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.940]   of your negativity bias or something.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:16.340]   Yeah, we don't have great answers to those things,
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.540]   but it's definitely true that our place really shapes
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:23.100]   kind of a lot of our tendencies that matter for happiness.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.380]   We know this from some of the local kind of place things
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:26.220]   that you said.
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:28.020]   I think my in-laws are from the Midwest
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:28.860]   and like, yeah, totally.
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:31.220]   They're just like great, decent, kind, happy people
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.300]   if they're listening right now.
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:33.140]   Like, I don't know you.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.300]   I'm trying to train to be like you, right?
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.700]   - They're wonderful.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:38.780]   - But we also know from even more macro level, right?
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.120]   So for now, for decades, the world happiness report
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.960]   in collaboration with the Gallup survey
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.000]   has been surveying happiness of people across the world,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.840]   right?
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.040]   And they come up with these like really consistent
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.140]   country level differences in happiness.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.440]   The U.S. for a very wealthy country is like not very happy.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.720]   We're pretty low on the scale.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.800]   And in fact, in the most recent world happiness report,
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.280]   we dipped like below like the top 10,
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.400]   like we've kind of had this major kind of dive
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.440]   for the first time.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.800]   - Who are the happiest?
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.840]   - Scandinavians.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.900]   So it's usually Denmark, Norway.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.940]   - My step mom's Danish.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.380]   I love going to Denmark.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.900]   Yeah, they're very, very happy.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.740]   - So they tend to be happy.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.820]   And so we can ask the question, what's the difference?
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.620]   Maybe it's, you know, the great Scandinavian genes,
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.980]   probably not.
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.060]   It's actually a lot of their cultural practices,
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.980]   which build on the sorts of things we're talking about,
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:25.340]   you know, take social connection, right?
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:28.620]   There's a lot less work hours.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.860]   So people can go home and hang out with their family.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.460]   There's a huge culture of clubs, for example, in Denmark,
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.260]   where people go off and do sporting things,
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:36.820]   a lot of fitness, right?
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.800]   And the structure is to kind of get that fitness, right?
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.120]   Like nobody expects you to be at work.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.880]   So you can go, you know, ski or workout or hang out.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.960]   - I will say they're very effective when they work.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.320]   They're very proficient.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.280]   I mean, I'm struck by the like average level
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.760]   of operational and intellectual intelligence of somebody.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.600]   Like the person, your waiter in Denmark
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.120]   is an awesome waiter.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.080]   - Yeah.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.360]   - And oftentimes has very interesting things to say.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.560]   Like the level of proficiency and the level of focus
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.480]   when they are working is immensely high.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.100]   So they're not just like kicking back all day.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.660]   - No, and I think in part it's a different attitude
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:11.380]   towards work, that there's a time for work,
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:13.100]   but you don't let your work eat,
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.460]   kind of like leak into other things.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.100]   There's this woman, Helen Russell,
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.420]   who wrote a book about the happiness in Denmark
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.780]   or "The Danish Path to Happiness,"
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.860]   I think is the name of the book.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:24.220]   And she had this quote of like,
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.380]   she was talking to people in Denmark,
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:28.220]   and there's often a thing that will happen
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:29.940]   where your manager has to talk to you at work
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.160]   and give you feedback.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.620]   And it's in part because you're not leaving work on time.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.880]   You're there over time,
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.100]   and they wanna have a conversation with you.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.060]   Like, what's your problem?
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.020]   Why can't you finish your work in the allotted hours?
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.400]   Which again, to American ears is like,
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.260]   what, your manager would never say that.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.100]   - I love it, I love it.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.600]   - But that's the social thing,
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.120]   but country level happiness is also affected
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.520]   by some of the thought patterns we talked about.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.480]   Like the Scandinavians, even though it's like cold and dark
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.040]   and nothing like it's here in California
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.200]   with you right now,
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.600]   they take joy in these tiny moments.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.160]   This idea of hygge, right, H-Y-G-G-E, hygge,
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.440]   where you notice the warmth of your coffee
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.180]   or have these candles or things.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.320]   It's a society that's really focused on presence
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.560]   in a really rich way.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.340]   - Love that.
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.700]   Like I said, my father's Latin.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:15.300]   He's from Argentina and he married a Danish woman.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.300]   And I would say much of their life is about cherishing
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:26.380]   and delighting in these small things, the everyday things.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:29.020]   I think that's, dare I say it,
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:31.180]   I think that's one of their major points of convergence.
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:32.560]   I know, I'm sure there are others,
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.020]   but that's a major point of convergence.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.240]   I think growing up in the United States,
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.020]   I sort of internalized this idea
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:44.620]   that you're supposed to figure out who you are
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.040]   and go do big things.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.660]   That was the message that I internalized.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.180]   Part of that was the high school I went to,
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.540]   it was super competitive high school
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.580]   and kind of people I tended to surround myself by.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.040]   But I think for some of us,
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.620]   the effort is in trying to learn
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:00.120]   to appreciate the little things.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.820]   Having a dog, and we have to talk about dogs,
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.100]   because you've actually studied dogs extensively.
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.020]   Dogs, non-human primates in a natural setting
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:13.180]   and the other old world primates, humans.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.420]   People talk about how dogs are just present.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.660]   They're not thinking about the past,
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:21.340]   they're not thinking about the future.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:23.260]   I'd like to challenge that just for a second.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:25.820]   This isn't the cynic in me, this is the scientist in me,
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:27.620]   and I'm genuinely curious.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:30.460]   How do we know that dogs aren't thinking a little bit
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:32.460]   about the past or the walk they're gonna take later
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:33.460]   that afternoon?
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.300]   Do we know?
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:35.800]   I mean, they have a prefrontal cortex
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.700]   that can anticipate things.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:38.640]   They have a memory system,
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.980]   they have a hippocampus and a cortex
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.180]   that can remember things.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:44.180]   So how do we know that our dog isn't sitting there,
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.900]   yes, trying to glean as much sunshine
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:50.100]   as they can on their belly through the window,
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.380]   but maybe they're thinking like,
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.160]   gosh, when are they gonna finish doing
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.000]   whatever it is they're doing
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.340]   so we can go outside and play ball?
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:56.940]   - Yeah, it's such a hard question.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.260]   It's such a hard question.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:00.180]   And I mean, I think it's one that every dog owner
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:03.020]   has really wondered about, right?
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.140]   I mean, I've thought about this question
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.140]   actually more in the monkeys, right?
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.420]   Who, you know, we can fight about dog neurobiology
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:09.460]   and they've got some of the stuff,
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.140]   but like they're kind of distinct,
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:12.760]   like tiny, you know, walnut brains
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.020]   rather than like primate-sized brains.
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.620]   - Well, let's just say that, well, first of all,
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:18.060]   dogs have, as far as I know,
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.900]   one of the most dramatic ranges in body size
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.380]   within a given species of animal.
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:24.700]   So Chihuahua Great Dane,
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.300]   I think it's the dosing of IGF-1
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:28.100]   that regulates body size in dogs.
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.800]   It's got a beautiful cover of Science Magazine
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:30.820]   that we can put a link to,
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:32.240]   with a Chihuahua and a Great Dane,
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.140]   and it's just like, whoa, same species.
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:37.020]   They have relatively small brains
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:39.180]   relative to their body weight size, regardless.
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:41.340]   - And if you look at what the brain's doing,
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.980]   a lot of it is sensory.
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.800]   I mean, a lot of it's olfactory, right?
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.580]   It's not the ruminative thinking about stuff
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:50.100]   that we kind of have like expanded a lot
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:51.380]   in the primate brain.
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.980]   - Not a lot of prefrontal cortex.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:53.820]   - Not a lot of prefrontal cortex.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:56.380]   - Stuff right behind your forehead, folks,
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.320]   is the part that allows you to say shh to your impulses,
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.000]   to quiet your impulses, suppress them,
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.360]   and also context-dependent learning and planning.
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.040]   So what to do, what to say, what not to do,
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.840]   what not to say in a given environment.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:14.160]   There's a lot in your brain about that
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:17.120]   that is controlled by so-called executive function,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.720]   the sort of conductor of the whole thing.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.080]   And you're saying dogs have a pretty limited
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.600]   real estate there. - They're limited.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.080]   And if you think about what that real estate does,
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.080]   it can kind of do that shh,
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.720]   it can take you out of the moment.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.560]   But there are kind of related parts of cortex close by
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.720]   that's doing a lot of the work
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.160]   of thinking about past episodes,
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.840]   thinking about what other people are thinking,
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.200]   thinking about counterfactuals.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.040]   - This is what humans are doing.
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:43.160]   - This is what humans are doing,
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.000]   like the human big version of this, right?
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.560]   And this is the kind of stuff that gets us into trouble
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.640]   when it comes to presence.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.000]   I think the dog's walking around,
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.720]   it's like, I don't know what it's sniffing,
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:55.600]   like, "Hydrant, hydrant, hydrant, dog, dog, person, person."
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:57.120]   And I think it's there
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.000]   because it doesn't have as much circuitry to be like,
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.840]   "Well, this hydrant's not exactly as good
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.320]   as the other hydrant I smelled before.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.080]   Like, what would Bob, the other dog,
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.360]   be thinking of this hydrant right now?"
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.200]   I think-
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.960]   - Or they're still laughing at so-and-so
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:11.240]   from the dog park incident two weeks ago, right?
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:12.080]   - Exactly.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.600]   - So much of human negative interaction
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.360]   is humans exchanging good and bad information
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.400]   about other humans.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.220]   - Oh, totally.
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:22.680]   - It's like kind of the basis of not all,
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.920]   but a lot of social media.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.300]   - Yeah, and a lot of our rumination
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.400]   is us thinking about the other information
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.880]   that people have about us, right?
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.720]   You know, kind of roommate-
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:30.560]   - When in fact we have no idea what people are thinking.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.840]   - Exactly, exactly, yeah.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.080]   And so, you know, I often think about this.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.480]   So in Buddhist circles,
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.560]   there's this discussion of the monkey mind,
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.200]   by which they mean the part of your mind
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.440]   that when you're trying to be present
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.880]   and focus on the moment,
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.080]   especially in practices like meditation,
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:46.280]   kind of runs off somewhere.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.560]   That's your monkey mind running off
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:48.760]   and you need to kind of yank it back
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.200]   by the tail or something.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.600]   And I've always thought that was a real
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:54.000]   kind of unnecessary diss to monkeys
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.140]   because my sense is at least the rhesus monkeys,
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.860]   which is a species I worked with,
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.900]   they seem a lot more like dogs than humans.
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.780]   You know, I work with this group of monkeys
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.780]   on a field site called Cayo Santiago.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.620]   It's this island off the coast of Puerto Rico
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:09.360]   and it's home to 1,000 free-ranging rhesus monkeys.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.500]   So we can do our studies and just kind of walk around
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.900]   with these monkeys who are kind of living freely.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.540]   And you see them and they just, you know,
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.780]   I'll sometimes sit near a monkey who's like sitting there,
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:20.780]   looking out into the ocean and just sitting there.
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:22.420]   And I'm like, I bet what's going on in his head
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.820]   is not that human Buddhist version of the monkey mind
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.220]   where he's like, what about this ocean?
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:27.060]   When do I have to go home?
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:27.880]   I have to cook something.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.720]   Oh, what did my husband say to me?
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.580]   Well, it's not that.
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:33.380]   I think the monkey's version is just like ocean, ocean.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.520]   Like it's just, it's just there.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.360]   - Or even better, like Costello,
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.460]   I used to look at him and think,
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.780]   what's going on in that brain of his?
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:42.580]   And then I realized it's probably,
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.940]   and this is a neurophysio,
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.700]   I wouldn't consider myself a neurophysiologist,
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.900]   but I'd done some, certainly a fair number of recordings
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.500]   from the live brain.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.060]   And I'm guessing most of what was in there
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.940]   is what we call hash, not the drug,
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:56.140]   but it's just, it's background white noise, shh, shh.
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:57.980]   That's the sound you hear on the audio monitor
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:00.440]   when there's no clean signal to noise.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.480]   I'm guessing it's just hash, like shh, shh, shh.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:08.080]   I wonder if the term monkey mind,
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.820]   well, here, I'll just come clean.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.500]   I always thought that monkey mind
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:12.980]   was this image of a little monkey
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:14.580]   swinging from tree to tree
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:17.140]   and that it's the adjective
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:20.500]   sort of superimposed on the human brain.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.660]   So, excuse me, it's the verb of the moving monkey
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.860]   transformed into an adjective,
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.300]   judgment about the human brain.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:30.860]   - But it's so sad if you're a monkey.
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:32.580]   Like, I think if monkeys had frontal cortex
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:35.100]   and talked to us, it'd be like, don't blame us for your,
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:37.180]   like, it's the human brain, part of the brain
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.340]   that you're on. - Well, it's like bird brain.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:40.980]   - You know, as somebody who really appreciates raptors
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:43.300]   and diving birds, think about the computations
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:44.140]   diving birds have to do.
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.040]   They have to adjust for the refractory index of the water.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.440]   So where they see the fish is not where the fish is.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.940]   And, you know, so when people say bird brain,
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:52.780]   I'm like-- - Oh, yeah.
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:54.460]   Don't get me started on COVID cognition.
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:56.660]   You guys are the smartest, yeah.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.820]   Smartest guys ever. - So monkeys,
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:00.700]   but you're making me realize,
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.140]   I always thought rhesus macaques,
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.140]   which are old world primates like us,
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.100]   or we're like them,
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:10.380]   that they had a fair amount of prefrontal real estate
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:13.780]   in their brain such that they could think
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.180]   and strategize and plan.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.540]   I mean, if one just watches one episode
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:20.540]   of that Netflix special, which I love,
[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:23.360]   which is "Chimp Empire,"
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.840]   there's all this stuff about who's in power
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.760]   and then they're gonna team up
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:28.020]   and then they're gonna wait a few days
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.160]   until that one's injured
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.060]   and then they're not gonna groom the other one
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.400]   and boom, there's an overtime.
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.860]   I mean, like very complicated.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:39.120]   It's chess, not checkers for old world primates.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.400]   - Yeah, I think there could be a big distinction
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:43.200]   between what chimpanzees are doing.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.360]   I mean, they're our closest, you know,
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.520]   tied with bonobos, our closest living relative.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.000]   You know, that was what, like 30 million,
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.240]   you know, like it wasn't so long, right?
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.720]   Whereas rhesus monkeys are pretty far off, right?
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.240]   I think there could be a lot of things
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.020]   that happened in between.
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:01.360]   And we know that not necessarily from the neurobiology
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.720]   'cause it's hard to ask kind of
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:04.800]   functional neurobiology questions with animals.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.280]   You can't kind of put them in an fMRI
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.400]   where they're doing behavior as easily as you can
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.880]   with a human.
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.520]   But we know it from cognition studies
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.240]   that look at things like, you know,
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.320]   how good are, say, rhesus monkeys at perspective taking,
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.280]   at kind of taking on someone else's beliefs,
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.720]   knowing, oh, somebody's thinking something.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.680]   - Theory of mind. - Theory of mind, yeah.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:24.880]   Thinking something different than I'm thinking.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.280]   And they're not so hot at it.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.480]   They really use their own perspective
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.080]   to make judgments pretty well.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.340]   Same thing when we look at cases
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:33.440]   of like counterfactual thinking, you know,
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.000]   do you have regret over an outcome that you didn't get,
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.560]   right, something that rhesus monkeys find kind of hard,
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.960]   right, so it seems like they're very good
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:44.640]   at sophisticatedly planning in the present moment, right?
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.160]   You know, you and I are talking here right now,
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.560]   if you're watching the video, you can see I have a cup,
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.000]   like I might be planning to pick up the cup, right?
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.920]   But the cups here, everything, I'm not simulating,
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.400]   what if this was a lovely martini, right?
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.840]   That's the kind of thing that probably a human
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.280]   can do really well, but a monkey can't.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.840]   So they can kind of plan and take next step actions
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:05.200]   when there's around the world that they experience,
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.560]   but they can't simulate worlds that are totally different.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.760]   And that includes the kind of complicated stuff
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.920]   going on in somebody else's head.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.280]   - So they're good at short-term strategy.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.000]   This fits with what a friend of mine
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.040]   who studies behavior in macaques told me,
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.160]   which is that you can set up a really nice, complicated,
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.860]   on paper, perfect experiment,
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:25.360]   where the monkey is going to inform you
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:28.440]   about some important feature of how the brain works
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.020]   in terms of behavioral economics or something.
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.360]   But then what you realize is, or what the monkey realizes,
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.020]   even if it doesn't consciously realize,
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:40.500]   is that no matter what,
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:44.260]   they're going to get reward 50% of the time on average,
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:45.660]   and they'll just hit the lever
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.500]   or give an answer as fast as they can.
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:50.300]   So they get that day's ration of reward
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.860]   and just that's the end of the day.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.840]   And so they're not cheating.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.320]   They're just like, why would I work any harder than this
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.620]   to actually do the experiment you want me to do?
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.860]   And so what many primate behavioral researchers
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.660]   end up becoming are monkey trainers.
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:06.500]   - Oh yeah.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:09.040]   I mean, the bane of every animal researcher's existence,
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.980]   this is whether you test dogs, monkeys, rodents, whatever,
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:13.860]   is what are called side biases.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.140]   What's a side bias?
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:17.420]   It's you're giving an animal a choice between A and B.
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:19.300]   One, A is on the left, B is on the right.
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.400]   And rather than think through these complicated things
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.240]   you want them to think through,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.260]   they're just like, whatever, A, left.
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:25.060]   I'll go left, left, left, left, left, left.
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:25.980]   And you're like, no,
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:27.780]   I know you get rewarded for 50% of the time,
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.340]   but I had this really creative question
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:32.620]   I wanted you to pay attention, and they just don't care.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.140]   - They don't care, well, they're--
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:37.020]   - Or they're getting rewarded enough at 50%
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:38.240]   that you have to do something
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.200]   like what's researchers in the field.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.460]   I mean, now we're getting really in the trenches
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.760]   called breaking a side bias.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.480]   We're like, no, I'm gonna give more reward at B.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.600]   If you're only going to left,
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.280]   then I'm gonna give more reward at right.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.260]   We move them and stuff,
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:50.560]   but it does often seem to be the case
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.320]   that the monkeys are training us
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.320]   more than we're training the monkeys, so.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.240]   - I delight in that a little bit.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.840]   I confess, just a little bit, just a tiny bit.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.000]   I mean, I just--
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.040]   - I'll share one story that kind of gets it,
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.760]   you know, this sort of perspective taking
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.300]   how good they are, that they are good
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.000]   when it's kind of what's in the here and now, right?
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.240]   We were doing these studies on the island
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.140]   which involved sort of showing monkeys some food,
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.920]   and we had these eggplants in a box
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.520]   that we were making the monkeys look at for various reasons.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:19.760]   We couldn't find a monkey to test.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.080]   On this island, you have to kind of hike around
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:22.840]   until you find a monkey who's kind of chilled out
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.200]   and whatever, and we hiked around the whole island.
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.320]   It was taking forever.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.840]   We get back to our starting location,
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.480]   and there's an eggplant that's sitting there.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.240]   We're like, where'd that eggplant come from?
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.520]   And we're like, and it's got like bite marks out of it.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:37.760]   We're like, how did that?
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.040]   And it was like, wait a minute,
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.040]   somebody must have stolen my eggplant.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.800]   And we're like, well, how did that happen?
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:45.120]   Like we were paying attention to the monkeys the whole time.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.480]   We realized like, no, no, no,
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.080]   they must have stolen it when we were,
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.600]   like, we probably put it down for a second,
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.440]   and like, they took it.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.280]   Like, we didn't drop it.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.080]   It was like, and so it was like, we realized like,
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:54.920]   oh, not only are they good at stealing,
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.120]   but they can tell, like, if we're looking at it.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.480]   But looking is something that, you know,
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.100]   all animals pay attention to gaze.
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:02.200]   Like, you know, this is the kind of thing
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.320]   that even, you know, insects pay attention to, right?
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:05.800]   That's why they have these kind of markings
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:08.320]   that look like eyes so that birds won't eat them and stuff.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.480]   Gaze following is really robust,
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.000]   but that's different than that monkey thinking,
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.400]   I bet that person's not looking.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:16.560]   It's probably like, no eyes, I can grab it, right?
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.480]   But if you look kind of more sophisticatedly,
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.320]   they're not good at it.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.440]   But this was another case of realizing like,
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:23.120]   oh, the monkeys are actually a lot smarter
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:26.840]   than we give them credit for, and maybe us too.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.240]   - Yeah, so what we're talking about is
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.760]   they are good at figuring out the basic rules,
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.520]   maybe even up to the level of what you call
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.560]   in computer programming, AND gates.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.920]   If this and that are happening, then I go right.
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:44.180]   If that and that are not happening,
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:45.920]   then I don't do anything.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:48.440]   And if that and a third option are happening,
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.000]   well, then I go left.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.040]   And if all three are happening, it doesn't matter.
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:55.760]   Like, they can probably figure out, you know,
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.760]   two or three levels of AND gates.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:59.280]   But what they can't do is simulate
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.840]   all these various situations.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.640]   I mean, the amazing thing about being a human
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.160]   is I could, you know, I could imagine any scenario.
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.080]   Imagine like 700 podcast listeners
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.400]   jumped on this table right now.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.160]   You know, imagine if the table was orange.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.120]   Like, imagine if you were, I don't know, another podcaster.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.800]   You're Malcolm Gladwell or whatever.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:15.640]   Like, I can-- - More hair.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:16.760]   - More hair, true.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:20.560]   I mean, I can simulate all these infinite different things
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.800]   to try to program that so hard.
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:25.120]   But it comes to us as humans in seconds.
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:26.360]   It's so fast.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.800]   And it's the kind of thing that we use all the time.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.920]   Honestly, it's the basis of a lot of our happiness.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.560]   Look at, you know, the fiction that we engage in, right?
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.240]   You know, we're constantly paying deep
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.920]   and close attention to fictional worlds.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:39.320]   I've cared more about some fictional worlds
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.280]   than I've cared about my own family members.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:42.120]   Sorry, family members.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:42.960]   But it's true, right?
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.200]   Like, you're reading a novel and you're like,
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.320]   I'm crying, I'm bawling, I'm cheering
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:50.720]   for these people that I know are completely made up
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:52.320]   because our brains just kind of dive
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.000]   into these sort of fake worlds,
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.560]   these alternative worlds so easily
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:58.320]   and so quickly, so powerfully.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.080]   - I definitely want to continue along the dimension
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.260]   of how we construct our happiness.
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:08.700]   But I just want to make sure that I ask again about dogs.
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:10.920]   (both laughing)
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.040]   And, you know, let's just do this 'cause, you know,
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.640]   I know it's so politically dangerous,
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:18.700]   but let's talk about the dog versus cat thing.
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:19.540]   - Yeah.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:21.400]   - You know, my sister loves cats.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:24.320]   I don't dislike cats, but that doesn't mean I like them.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.580]   I once rented a place where there was a big cat,
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:28.160]   I think it was one of these Maine Coon cats.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:29.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:29.840]   - His name was Baloo.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.660]   - They're basically dogs.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.500]   - And he's basically a dog.
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.860]   And Costello had certain cat-like qualities,
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.680]   like he just wanted to lounge all day.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:37.000]   He could really move like a dog,
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.920]   but most of the time he was kind of like a cat at home
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.840]   and it was frustrating for me.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.120]   But what do you think it is?
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:44.760]   You know, you have these feline people
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.220]   and you have dog people.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:49.600]   And I'm definitely in the dog camp.
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:50.960]   But one of the reasons I love dogs
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.800]   is I assume they're in the present,
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.360]   but mostly it's the unconditional love.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.720]   But what do you think it is, this dog-cat thing?
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:00.200]   I mean, cats are presumably in the present as well.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.640]   - Yeah.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.380]   - They don't make long-term plans.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:05.880]   And if they do, they don't actualize those plans.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.600]   So why is it that some people feel
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.300]   that cats are like nasty animals
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.460]   that are plotting against them?
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.920]   And some people delight in cats.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.800]   - Yeah, I don't have great data on it,
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:15.960]   but my sense is it gets back
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.920]   to the unconditional love idea.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.320]   Like, if you're the kind of person
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:21.080]   who craves the unconditional love,
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.800]   you wind up being more of a dog person.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:23.640]   - Yes.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:26.800]   - But if you like the, what was it that your niece?
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:27.960]   - Yeah, my niece, yeah.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.800]   - What was it that your niece said?
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.560]   Just like-- - No push me.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.600]   She used to hold her finger up.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:35.160]   - Yeah, cats are a lot more no push me.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.720]   - Unless we said we were going for ice cream,
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:38.920]   it was no push me.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:41.320]   And I remember, and I still delight in it,
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.440]   thinking like, awesome.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.880]   She had just, I mean, like she had such a strong spirit
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:46.720]   from the time she was little.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:48.440]   - You might like cats 'cause cats are a lot
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.320]   of like no push me.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.480]   And I think this is--
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.760]   - Oh no, I don't want a cat.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.560]   - Well, I think the like removal
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:57.960]   of the sort of no push me might be one of the last stages
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:00.000]   of evolution and domestication of dogs.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.440]   And I know this because in my dog work,
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.360]   we also did some very fun work with dingos,
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.360]   which are the Australian wild dogs.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:07.600]   And we don't fully know their history.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.680]   Our sense is like those dogs kind of like
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:11.960]   got pretty close to humans, pretty tolerant of humans,
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.320]   but didn't go like all the way to Costello
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.760]   in terms of the bond.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.240]   And one of the amazing things,
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:19.240]   we interacted with this group at a sanctuary
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.920]   for dingoes out in Australia,
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.160]   one of the only sets of genetically pure dingoes
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.640]   in the world with this wonderful privilege to work with.
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.640]   But we kind of had to like do our keep
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.680]   at these field stations.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:30.440]   So we kind of went in and helped cleaned up
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:31.880]   with the dingoes and so on.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.800]   And every morning you'd go out
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:35.000]   and you'd give the dingoes their food,
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.920]   which are these big kind of chickens.
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:38.560]   And they would just, I mean,
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.120]   they'd just kind of raw chickens, not live chickens,
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.880]   but they'd just like chomp it in one gulp,
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.160]   just like bones and all.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.080]   And you're like, whoa.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.120]   And then right after that,
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.080]   they'd want to be kind of, oh, come on, nudge me, be nice.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.880]   It was like a cat in its best mood.
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.160]   But then at a certain point, they were just like, no,
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.000]   like I'll stop.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.360]   They just had like such their own will
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.960]   in this really amazing way.
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:59.880]   And it just felt incredibly cat-like.
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.480]   I'm like, you look like a dog,
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:04.240]   but your behavior is so much more cat-like.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:05.880]   So I don't know, no great studies on this.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.240]   It'd be great to kind of figure it out.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.880]   But my sense is distinction between dog people
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.460]   and cat people might be the unconditional love,
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:15.240]   no push me ratio of what people like.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:16.240]   - So interesting.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:18.880]   And I like to think did not take us too far off course
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.200]   in our discussion about happiness,
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.960]   because we clearly delight in this.
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:23.040]   And hopefully people do too,
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.840]   is that we think about the different brain architectures
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.680]   and the different capabilities
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.800]   that different brain architectures have across species.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.080]   And the fact that we live in such close proximity
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.360]   to some of these species is wild.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.200]   When I was growing up, not everyone had a dog
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.720]   unless they had the space for it.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.760]   Now I feel like dogs are everywhere.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.780]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like such an enormous
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.400]   billion dollar industry to have dogs.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.500]   And it raises a question that kind of gets us back
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.180]   to some of the happiness work, which is,
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:49.220]   is that a good idea, right?
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.740]   All these people are investing their time, their energy,
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:53.300]   their spaces in dogs.
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:55.860]   You could ask the question, do they make us happier?
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:56.980]   And I know they do.
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:58.780]   Yeah, don't, I'm not gonna break everybody's heart.
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:01.420]   We've killed the cat people and the toy dog people.
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:05.140]   No, pet dogs in particular, but pets in general
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:06.340]   wind up making us happier.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:08.820]   Pet owners are statistically happier.
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:11.080]   And I think it's for a couple of reasons
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.760]   based on the stuff we just talked about.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:15.300]   Take the behavioral pattern that matters, social connection.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.600]   For sure, dogs provide that social connection themselves.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.840]   We just talked about they tap into your caregiving system
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:23.960]   and so on, but as you talked about in your interactions
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:27.040]   with like bulldog pleading, like bulldog,
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.800]   what was the phrase you used?
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:31.520]   When you see a bulldog and you say bulldog something.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.880]   - Oh, when I see somebody with a bulldog,
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.960]   I just say, excuse me, there's a bulldog tax.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.800]   - Oh yeah, bulldog tax, sorry.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.120]   - And then I pet their bulldog.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:38.960]   - Yeah, good, let me go back.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:39.780]   - And if you're gonna meet a bulldog,
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.700]   just understand they're shaped like a beer keg
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:45.180]   so they can't scratch themselves on their hindquarters.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:46.540]   So if you give them a scratch there,
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.580]   they're like, thank you, because it's gotta be just awful.
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:51.220]   It's like having that scratch in the middle of your back
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:52.300]   and you can't reach it.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.180]   - So you do the bulldog tax
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:56.460]   and you have this nice social connection with the bulldog,
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:59.300]   but my guess is, and 'cause you're using verbal language,
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:00.940]   you also connected with the person.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.940]   You probably say, oh my gosh, what's his name?
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:03.780]   Oh, when did you get him?
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:04.620]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:06.780]   That's chatting with the barista at the coffee shop, right?
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.840]   That's doing the Nick Epley experiments
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.460]   we just talked about before.
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:13.420]   Pets wind up bringing us social connection.
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:15.620]   And one of the pieces of advice if you're feeling lonely
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:17.820]   is get an animal, not just so that the animal
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:20.180]   will give you some comfort, but particularly with a dog,
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:22.660]   you get to walk that animal and then people talk to you.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:24.940]   It's much easier to connect with people when you have dogs.
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:27.540]   So social connection is huge.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:30.780]   Second thing is, particularly again for dogs,
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.620]   what are people doing?
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.700]   They're getting out and walking, right?
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.780]   So we're getting some people who never had
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:37.260]   a lot of physical exercise before
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:38.660]   are at least getting the kind of walks
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:40.220]   they need to do in for the dog.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:42.220]   And even if they won't choose to do it for themselves,
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.020]   they often choose to do it for their dog.
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:46.940]   So you get exercise in, which is good for physical health
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:47.780]   and we haven't talked about,
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.160]   but is enormously good for happiness.
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:52.620]   Meta-analysis showing a half hour of cardio exercise a day
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:54.680]   is as good as a anti-depression medication
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:56.180]   for reducing symptoms of depression.
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:58.700]   So just that walk with your dog is great.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:01.040]   But beyond that, I think they help our thought patterns,
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:01.880]   right?
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:03.340]   And this is true for dogs, I think, and cats, right?
[02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:04.420]   Where, you know, as you were saying,
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:06.320]   we're wondering what they're doing.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.400]   Sometimes if they're sitting there
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.260]   and we're just petting them,
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:09.460]   what we're doing is we're sitting there
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:10.300]   and we're petting them.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.780]   So they give us these wonderful sensory experiences.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:15.740]   And I think they cause us to be a little bit more present,
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:17.580]   especially when we're kind of interacting with them.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:18.660]   You know, when we're interacting with our dogs,
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.260]   unless you're taking the Instagram pictures of the dog,
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:23.000]   but usually when you're playing with the dog or whatever,
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.580]   you're just there, you're not on your phone.
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:27.220]   You're just kind of mindfully experiencing
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:28.100]   life with your dog.
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:29.700]   Kind of like when you talked about your road trip,
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:31.460]   you know, part of what probably brought you
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:32.340]   into the present moment,
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:34.100]   especially if your girlfriend was working,
[02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:35.800]   was like that the dog was interacting with you.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:37.860]   So the dogs help us,
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:40.060]   not 'cause they're inherently kind of happiness inducing,
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.340]   they help us tick these boxes
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:43.260]   of better behaviors for happiness,
[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:44.620]   better thought patterns for happiness,
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:46.140]   and they're kind of a delight.
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:48.580]   So they kind of give us some positive emotion too.
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:50.820]   - I love all of that.
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:53.600]   I just want to double click,
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.380]   if it were on this idea that they can be a bridge
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:58.900]   for social connection.
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:00:59.980]   That's really powerful.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:02.140]   A friend of mine who used to smoke cigarettes,
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:04.100]   who doesn't any longer.
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:06.500]   In fact, I remember when I was a postdoc at Stanford
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:08.580]   that like the, mostly the foreign postdocs,
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:09.980]   but they used to gather outside
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:11.520]   and have cigarette breaks all the time.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:12.980]   Now you're not allowed to smoke
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:14.600]   on the medical school campus.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.480]   And I think probably on the main campus too.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.500]   Most places you're not allowed to smoke outdoors.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:21.620]   Right, because of secondhand smoke, in any case.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:23.700]   But he said to me, you know,
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:28.380]   it used to be that before people either knew
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:32.460]   or fully internalized how bad smoking was, is,
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.620]   that asking for a cigarette
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:36.420]   or sharing a cigarette side-by-side with somebody
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:39.000]   was a way that people engaged in casual interaction.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.140]   Not just outside of bars,
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:41.980]   not just to meet potential mates, et cetera,
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.900]   but it was just, it was a bridge.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:45.180]   You know, you could walk up to somebody and say,
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.220]   you know, like we used to call it like bumming a smoke.
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:50.420]   Like you ask for a cigarette or if someone was smoking,
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:52.940]   you could go stand by them and you also smoke.
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:55.680]   And so it was this terribly health-diminishing habit,
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:57.700]   but it served as a lot of social lubricant.
[02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:00.220]   - Yeah, it also gives you another behavior
[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:02.220]   that we know is really important for happiness,
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:04.180]   which is time.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:06.500]   There's a lot of social science research on this phenomena
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:07.740]   that's called time affluence,
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:09.320]   which is a sort of subjective sense
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:10.780]   that you feel wealthy in time.
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:12.980]   You kind of just have a break, right?
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.980]   You get a, like a smoking break is one of these, right?
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:17.180]   You get a break and often people, you know,
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:18.780]   back in the day when smoking was allowed,
[02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:20.340]   one of the ways that you got your breaks,
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:21.820]   often in not so great workplaces,
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:23.800]   was like you could ask for a smoke break.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.700]   My mom talks about this.
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:27.060]   She was a teacher, educator for a super long time
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:28.600]   where you don't get a lot of breaks,
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.740]   but, you know, back in the '70s, if you were a smoker,
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:32.260]   they'd let you go outside for 10 minutes
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:33.700]   and that was a sort of break, right?
[02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:35.220]   So I think this other unhealthy habit
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:37.780]   kind of gave us the opportunity to take breaks,
[02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:39.300]   which we know are great for happiness
[02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:41.820]   and so great for happiness that if you don't have any
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:43.620]   of this so-called time affluence sense
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:45.180]   that you have some free time,
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:47.380]   if you experience what researchers call time famine,
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:49.540]   where you feel like almost starving for time,
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.140]   it's a huge hit on your wellbeing.
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:53.340]   If you self-report in these surveys being time famish,
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:55.280]   so I don't have time to meet up with my friends,
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.220]   I never have time for the stuff I wanna do,
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:59.180]   that's as big a hit on your wellbeing
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:01.320]   as if you self-report being unemployed.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.820]   You know, listeners, if you have a job
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:04.860]   and you lost it tomorrow,
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:06.500]   you'd probably think that that is a big hit
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:07.480]   on your happiness.
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.340]   Just not having any time for the little breaks in life
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:11.660]   is as bad.
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:12.500]   - Wow.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.460]   - And this gets back to our earlier discussion
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:15.700]   about money and happiness,
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:17.740]   which is researcher Ashley Willans
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:20.020]   at Harvard Business School has kind of pushed the idea
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:22.500]   that what's going on with these low-income folks
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:24.500]   who have a real hit on happiness, right?
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:27.140]   Not having a high income hurts your happiness.
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:29.900]   Her theory is a lot of that actually has to do with time.
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:31.740]   'Cause if you have a really low income,
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:32.860]   you don't have a car to get to work,
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:34.740]   so you're taking the bus and it's taking you forever,
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.580]   you're working multiple jobs, right?
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:38.820]   That a lot of the reason that money affects happiness
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.200]   and not having money affects happiness
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:42.100]   is that it co-varies with not having time.
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:44.720]   And the real hit on our happiness is just the time part
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:46.400]   more so than the money part.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:49.020]   - So we need to be in pursuit of things,
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:50.160]   we need to work,
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.420]   but we also need some free time.
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:57.140]   We can't have too much free time or too much work basically.
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:59.700]   And the sweet spot is often hard to maintain
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:01.460]   or even know what that sweet spot is.
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:03.740]   - Yeah, I think that this term kind of time affluence
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:05.700]   and what researchers mean by it is helpful here, right?
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:07.940]   It's the subjective sense that you have some free time.
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.080]   It's not I objectively go into your calendar
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.260]   and you show me how many open blocks there are.
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:14.900]   It's your sense that you have a break.
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:16.620]   And this provides an interesting hack
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:18.540]   that we can use to get more of it, right?
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:21.740]   Which is that we can kind of just frame things
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:23.620]   as having more time.
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.060]   You know, 'cause sometimes when you get a break
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:27.620]   that you don't expect, it can feel like a lot.
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:30.820]   I teach this class about happiness on Yale's campus
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:32.020]   and I talk about time affluence.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:33.340]   It's one of the topics in my class.
[02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:35.320]   And I always felt that was really ironic
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:36.360]   'cause our young people today,
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.140]   especially at elite college institutions
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:40.300]   are so time famished.
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:41.500]   They're running from thing to thing
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:43.180]   and have a million extracurriculars and so on.
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:45.340]   So I feel like I'm gonna lecture them for an hour
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.500]   on time affluence and tell them all these studies.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:50.180]   And so what I did was,
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:52.420]   in the syllabus is that there's a lecture on time affluence
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:53.500]   and they come to class.
[02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:54.900]   And I have my teaching assistants
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.380]   that are handing out little flyers that say,
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:59.940]   today's lecture is about time affluence
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:01.820]   and to teach you what that is, I'm gonna give you some.
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:02.780]   No class today.
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:04.660]   So you didn't know, you walked to class,
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:06.260]   now you got a free hour and a half.
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:09.700]   And it just happened to be one of these unusually warm,
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:11.860]   like California-esque days in New Haven
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:12.820]   where it's like sunny out.
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:15.240]   So kids got a bubble tea with their friend
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.340]   or some of them went on a hike
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:18.380]   near the local state park.
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:21.300]   And one of the students I remember burst into tears
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.180]   when she got this form.
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:26.260]   And she said, this is the first free hour and a half
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:28.820]   I've had for like the last three months.
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:30.620]   - Wow, they're that stressed.
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:31.460]   - They're that stressed.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:33.420]   But what I find interesting about this is like,
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:35.740]   I didn't give them a month off vacation, right?
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:38.220]   I gave them an hour back unexpectedly
[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:40.260]   and it felt like it was huge.
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:41.580]   And Andrew, I don't know your schedule,
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:43.500]   but sometimes my schedule can be so overwhelmed
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:45.100]   and so packed that there's a half hour meeting
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:45.940]   that gets canceled.
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:48.020]   I'm just like, oh, and like the relief.
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:50.220]   I feel like I could learn a new language.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.340]   You just feel like, but it's a half hour, right?
[02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:55.340]   And I think this is a hack we can use for ourselves, right?
[02:05:55.340 --> 02:05:57.420]   Listeners right now, go on your calendar
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:59.740]   a few months from now and just like,
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:01.340]   take like months, months away,
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:03.060]   pick an hour period and just write in like
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:05.540]   a Huberman lab time affluence
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:07.100]   and just don't put anything in that.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:09.340]   And my guess is when you get to that hour
[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:10.540]   that you've scheduled months later,
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:12.620]   you'll just be like, oh my gosh, this feels great.
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:15.820]   We can kind of gift ourselves these little windows of time.
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:18.820]   Another hack we can do is to make good use
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:20.700]   of the free time we do have.
[02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:21.860]   And this is kind of a puzzle,
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:23.140]   something that I found unexpected
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.180]   when I saw the data on this,
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:27.580]   which is that turns out we actually have more free time now
[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:30.620]   than we did like 10, 15 years ago, if you add it up.
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:31.740]   Not just kind of post COVID,
[02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:34.260]   but in general, we've been getting more free time.
[02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:37.540]   However, the free time we have is cut up differently.
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:38.780]   It's in smaller chunks.
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:40.620]   It's like five minutes when that Zoom meeting
[02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:41.660]   ends a little earlier,
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:43.460]   10 minutes if your kid falls asleep earlier,
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:44.620]   whatever it is.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:45.820]   And we don't think it's that much,
[02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:46.940]   so we just kind of blow it.
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:47.780]   But if you add it up,
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:51.660]   it winds up more than people in past decades have had,
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:54.820]   and probably good time that we could use for stuff.
[02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:56.820]   And so these little chunks of time
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.860]   are what the journalist Bridget Schult calls time confetti,
[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:01.220]   which I think is such a great image of it.
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:03.360]   It's this little five minutes here and there,
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:06.900]   but you can do a lot with those minutes if you add them up.
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:07.740]   We just have to use them
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:09.020]   a little bit more intentionally, right?
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:11.340]   And that could be, for some of the stuff you talk about
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:12.420]   on this podcast a lot,
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:15.340]   like use that, do the seven minute New York Times workout,
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:17.580]   do the kinds of things we're talking about.
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:19.820]   That's the time you text your friend and have a delight,
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.940]   or-- - Get some sunlight.
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:23.140]   - Get some sunlight, walk outside, right?
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.580]   - Walk in sunlight, huge--
[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:27.260]   - Problem is what do we do when we get the time confetti?
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:29.540]   Or I mean, what do I do when I'm in a bad moment?
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:31.780]   Blow out our phone, check our email, scroll through.
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:34.220]   It's like, again, the sort of NutraSweet dopamine hit
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:35.920]   that's not being effective.
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:38.140]   So if you feel really overwhelmed
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:40.340]   and you objectively don't have a lot of time,
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:42.620]   remember that the time confetti that you already have,
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.460]   it's already sitting there,
[02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:46.300]   it can be really valuable if you use it well.
[02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:50.380]   - Super important because I think the filling
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:54.580]   of those spaces with what I love the analogy
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.900]   to NutraSweet or artificial sweeteners
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:58.740]   is it's gonna taste like it's providing
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:07:59.780]   some sort of nourishment,
[02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:03.780]   but it's probably just creating a more sense of craving
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:05.140]   and want at some level.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:08.400]   Would really like to talk about reward circuitry,
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:11.500]   just thematically, listeners of this podcast,
[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:15.100]   and even if they've never heard one of these podcasts before
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.820]   probably familiar with the word dopamine,
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:18.420]   we've talked about it a bit.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:20.100]   And as we were talking about earlier,
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.900]   everything about the dopamine reward circuitry,
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:25.260]   which of course includes other chemicals too,
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:29.700]   is based on prior experience relative to current experience
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:32.740]   relative to anticipated outcome.
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:34.940]   What's sometimes referred to as reward prediction error.
[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:36.780]   Think something great's gonna happen,
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:39.300]   something great happens, great.
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:40.580]   Think something great's gonna happen,
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:44.260]   something less than great happens, sucks way more
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:46.260]   than you would anticipate.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.060]   Think that something not so great's gonna happen,
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:51.300]   something so, so great happens, huge reward.
[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:53.300]   Novelty, surprise brings the break.
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:56.860]   Positive novelty and surprise brings the biggest rewards.
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:09:00.540]   And this is what I would like to kind of paint
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:02.020]   as the backdrop, think about it
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:04.660]   as a conceptual mural behind us.
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:09.260]   As I asked the question, maybe, just maybe,
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:13.620]   we're not supposed to be happy all the time,
[02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:16.140]   or maybe even all that often.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:21.220]   And when we're feeling not so great or even lousy,
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:25.100]   provided it's not dangerous levels of depression,
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:27.700]   maybe we should frame that as the backdrop
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.740]   for the greater happiness that will come
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:33.540]   when we start to emerge from that lousy state.
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:34.380]   Now, some people would say,
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:36.460]   well, now you're just kind of using neurobiology
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:40.020]   to twist around what would otherwise be a lousy experience
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:41.860]   and tell me that it's good for me.
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:46.180]   No, what I'm trying to say is people want to be happy.
[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:47.980]   I think we'd all love to be happy all the time,
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.180]   but we're not wired to be happy all the time.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:53.540]   And maybe the feelings of happiness can't exist
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:57.380]   unless they have contrast with these neutral
[02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:01.020]   or negative emotion states that we call, I don't know,
[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:02.900]   feeling lousy, feeling anxious, et cetera.
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:06.460]   And just, I realize I can pose long questions,
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:09.060]   but I just wanna provide a little bit more context
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:11.620]   for the moment, which is that every circuit in the brain,
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:14.580]   our ability to see light, literally,
[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:18.020]   depends on the contrast with the so-called off-circuitry,
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:20.300]   which is the circuitry in our visual system
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:21.540]   that perceives darkness.
[02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.880]   We need contrast to be able to see light.
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:27.980]   Everything's push-pull, hunger satiety,
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:32.580]   cold, heat perception, go, no-go.
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:34.820]   It's all push-pull circuitry in there.
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:38.420]   Why wouldn't happiness have a push-pull relationship
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:41.540]   with unhappiness or at least neutral affect?
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.900]   - Yeah, well, I think it does.
[02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:45.260]   I mean, you're giving a neurobiological explanation
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.660]   for what psychologists in this field of positive psychology
[02:10:48.660 --> 02:10:51.340]   have referred to as what's called hedonic adaptation,
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:55.080]   which is a fancy way of saying we get used to stuff.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:59.700]   You grab the delicious ice cream cone,
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:02.420]   or I don't know, we do a delicious salad, really healthy,
[02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:04.460]   but it's a tasty, healthy, tasty salad, right?
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:07.240]   Start eating it, first bite is like, this is awesome.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.700]   I'm so into it, it's great.
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:10.980]   Bite number two, a little bit less awesome,
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:11.820]   a little bit less awesome.
[02:11:11.820 --> 02:11:13.340]   By the 10th bite, it's not 'cause you're full
[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:14.740]   or you're feeling disgusted,
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.820]   it's just like that sensory experience,
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:18.220]   you've gotten used to it, right?
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:19.900]   It's just no longer as interesting.
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:21.300]   - Walk into a bakery.
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:23.220]   - Yeah, exactly. - Mm, smells amazing.
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.720]   Spend five minutes in the bakery, 10 minutes in the bakery,
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:27.420]   you attenuate, you habituate.
[02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:28.260]   - Which is great.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:30.500]   I mean, you wouldn't maybe wanna be firing your neurons
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:31.580]   when you get all exhausted and stuff,
[02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:34.620]   but it's in one way, terrible for happiness,
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:35.740]   in another way, very good for happiness,
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:37.520]   but in a major way, terrible for happiness,
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:39.040]   which is the following.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.820]   Every good thing in life, if it sticks around,
[02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:44.400]   becomes kinda boring over time.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.600]   You're just kind of used to it.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:49.000]   I use the example sometimes of, you know,
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.640]   the last time, the first time your partner said I love you,
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:54.540]   or if you had a kid, the first time your kid said mommy
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:58.880]   or daddy, that feels amazing, right?
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:01.440]   But like, you know, last week, my husband said I love you,
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:02.800]   it's like, whatever, I'm just used to it, right?
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:03.920]   You know, last week when your kid was like,
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.820]   I love you, mommy, like, you don't care, right?
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:10.040]   The most amazing thing in life, if it gets repeated,
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:11.700]   just becomes boring.
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:13.980]   And that sucks because, you know,
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:15.720]   you like the most amazing things in life
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:17.980]   to kind of keep being awesome,
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:20.580]   it's pretty sad that we don't have it, right?
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.020]   This has a flip side, though,
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:24.780]   which is very good for happiness, hedonic adaptation,
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:28.940]   which is the most terrible thing in life can happen,
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.820]   and over time, you get used to that, too.
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:33.300]   You know, so your partner breaks up with you,
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:35.120]   you find out you have a chronic disease, right?
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.960]   Just something like really bad happens.
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:39.480]   Day one, when you find out that piece of information,
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.840]   it is awful, but day two, yeah, it's still awful,
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:43.800]   but that's just your life,
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:46.680]   and then over time, it kind of gets better.
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:48.320]   There's a very famous study in the field
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.220]   of happiness science that tried to look at this
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:52.760]   with people who experienced a really great event,
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:54.800]   in theory, winning the lottery,
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:56.760]   and people who experienced really bad events,
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:58.760]   real events in life, becoming paraplegic.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:00.360]   So you used to be able to walk,
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.240]   and now you've lost the use of your legs.
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.580]   You survey happiness in people
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:05.940]   who haven't had these experiences,
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:08.300]   and you ask, predict how bad it would be to have this,
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:09.500]   and people say, you know,
[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:11.660]   day one of winning the lottery would be really great,
[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:13.460]   and, you know, a year from now,
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.140]   a year from that point, winning the lottery
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:17.300]   would still be just as great, it'd be awesome.
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:18.500]   Same thing with paraplegic.
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.780]   You know, moment you become paraplegic,
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:22.780]   that day is a really crappy Thursday,
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:25.140]   but a year from then is still just as crappy,
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:27.180]   and what you find is people, you know,
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:28.460]   on the day you become paraplegic,
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.660]   or the day you win your lottery,
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:32.480]   like, that is a big shift in your contrast, right?
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:33.400]   You know, the day you win the lottery
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:34.800]   is an awesome Thursday.
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:37.000]   Day you become paraplegic is terrible.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.320]   But a year from then, it turns out your happiness
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.680]   is no different from baseline,
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.280]   from the day before that event happened, right, statistically.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:45.760]   And that is shocking, right?
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.940]   Like, I know these results, I can quote the paper,
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:49.600]   but like, if you told me today,
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.840]   Laura, you know, you walk out of the studio,
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:53.360]   you get by a car, you're paraplegic,
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.860]   how would you feel in 2026?
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:57.840]   I'd be like, my life is still really crummy,
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:00.260]   but statistically that's just not gonna happen.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:01.580]   What does that mean?
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:03.060]   That's kind of good news
[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:04.620]   about hedonic adaptation for happiness.
[02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:07.820]   That means the worst thing possible could happen to you,
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:09.220]   and you have all these processes
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:10.860]   that are just gonna get used to it over time,
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:12.440]   and it's gonna be okay.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:13.780]   And I think this is an important aspect
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:15.380]   of our psychology that we forget.
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:17.000]   I think sometimes we have opportunities
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.700]   to do things in life that are a little risky,
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:21.700]   something we might try out that we might screw up,
[02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:24.500]   or fail at, or that we'll be bad at at first,
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:25.980]   and we don't do it because we're scared,
[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:26.860]   we're making a prediction, like,
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:29.520]   oh, well, if I failed, or if I screwed that up,
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.060]   you know, I'd just be unhappy.
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:32.820]   But actually, all these mechanisms
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:34.300]   that we have of hedonic adaptation
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:36.300]   means those things aren't gonna affect you
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.280]   for as long as you think.
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:42.280]   So I think the contrast hypothesis about happiness is real.
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:45.660]   Good things don't stay good things over time,
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.920]   but the bad things don't either, and so.
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:50.100]   But we still want the good things to stay good over time,
[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:52.340]   and so that raises a question of how we can do that.
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.340]   And Liz Dunn, whose work I've mentioned before,
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:56.580]   she likes to use this phrase that scarcity
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:58.960]   engineers happiness, right?
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:01.980]   One thing we can do is space out the good things in life.
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:04.140]   You know, so if I was having that really delicious,
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:06.620]   healthy salad with the avocado, whatever,
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:09.540]   if I had that every day, it would stop being good.
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:12.580]   But if I had it very, very infrequently,
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:14.700]   it would still be good every time I come back to it.
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:18.140]   And so sometimes, oddly, the way we make ourselves happier
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:20.980]   is to kind of remove positive experiences,
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:23.520]   especially extreme positive experiences,
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.580]   kind of space them out so we can kind of come back
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:26.660]   to them over time.
[02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:29.280]   - I definitely agree with that.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.260]   I also, and forgive me, folks,
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:35.220]   but I think I understand why dogs are so awesome.
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:36.980]   They don't attenuate to reward.
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:40.260]   You tell them they're gonna get this little piece
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:42.840]   of amazing whatever, beef jerky or something,
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:44.220]   and they're like, "Yes!"
[02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:46.260]   Then second trial, "Yes!"
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:47.420]   Third trial, "Yes!"
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:49.980]   I mean, presumably at some point,
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:51.820]   they reach satiety or fatigue,
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:54.880]   but there's something about their reward pathways
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.740]   that they don't seem to attenuate much.
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:59.460]   And if there's feedback to us on that, it's like,
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:01.500]   "Okay, okay, it's great."
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:06.500]   They'll keep delighting in the simple little things.
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:10.100]   It seems like almost as much as the first time.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:11.180]   We are not like that.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.020]   - It's interesting.
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:13.320]   To my knowledge, people haven't studied
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:15.580]   eudemic adaptation in dogs, but it's a really good question.
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:19.060]   But we are not like that for most things.
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.140]   And this sucks, right?
[02:16:21.140 --> 02:16:23.620]   I mean, it's also the case that in addition
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:26.660]   to kind of getting used to stuff over time,
[02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:27.900]   it's also showing a different feature,
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.900]   which is a sort of more particular contrast feature
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:30.740]   you're talking about.
[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:33.500]   So over time, we kind of habituate.
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.620]   That's one sort of neural mechanism.
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:36.860]   But another is the one that you mentioned,
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:38.460]   which is about the contrast, right?
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:39.660]   And that's what you see kind of,
[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:41.740]   you see both of them, say, in the light perception, right?
[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:43.620]   If I show you the same light over time,
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:44.540]   you're gonna habituate.
[02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:46.020]   That's eudemic adaptation.
[02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:49.460]   - For folks listening, it literally disappears.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.460]   If I set up the right experiment,
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:53.540]   Russ and Karen Devaloy at Berkeley years ago
[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:55.260]   did these beautiful experiments.
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:58.460]   You look at like a grating of light projected onto a wall,
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:16:59.980]   and if you can stabilize the eyes
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:02.180]   so that they're not moving around,
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:04.420]   it literally will disappear.
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:07.040]   Same thing with an odor, same thing with touch, right?
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:08.500]   Like I wasn't thinking about my contact with the chair.
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:10.860]   - Same thing with happiness, my deliciousness, so solid.
[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:13.340]   - Habituation, attenuation, these are technical terms
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:14.740]   when you really get down into it.
[02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:19.260]   And the push-pull antagonism between light and dark.
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:23.660]   The smell, yes, no, on, off, push, all of it, go, no, go.
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:25.620]   Every single aspect of the nervous system
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:26.460]   functions this way.
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:29.540]   It's a flexor extensor in the musculoskeletal system.
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:31.140]   - But that gets to maybe what I would think of as different.
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:34.300]   So eudemic adaptation is the same stimulus over time,
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.960]   like almost like habituation.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.300]   There's a different thing that happens
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:39.340]   when you get what you might call a contrast.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.900]   And there's all kinds of visual illusions
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:43.060]   that sort of function on this.
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:44.540]   If you've ever seen the one where it's like,
[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.540]   you know, is it the same color over here, over here?
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.940]   It could be throw this on your show page to show people.
[02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:50.260]   And it's like, oh, it looks different.
[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:53.220]   It's like, no, no, no, that's because of the kind of contrast
[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:54.340]   between the two things.
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.160]   You see something that's really bright over here,
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.420]   it makes something else look a little darker, right?
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:01.640]   That's a different negative effect on our happiness
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:02.480]   a lot of the time.
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:03.940]   This is the comparison effect, right?
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:07.180]   This is like, you know, my $50 million seems kind of crappy
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:10.540]   'cause I hang out with people who have $100 million.
[02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:12.820]   Objectively, I have a tremendous amount of money,
[02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:14.940]   but I feel bad 'cause I'm kind of comparing
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:16.220]   against something else.
[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:19.820]   And so oftentimes when we're evaluating different rewards,
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:22.580]   we're kind of comparing them against what other people had
[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:24.500]   or what we've had in the past.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:27.740]   And that means that being in an objectively good situation
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:30.820]   might feel really crappy if you just have somebody else
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:33.340]   that has a slightly better objectively good situation.
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:34.700]   My favorite example of this actually comes
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:36.380]   from the sports world.
[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:38.340]   So researchers asked this interesting question,
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:41.500]   like how happy are you when you win an Olympic medal, right?
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:43.420]   You're on the stand, you won an Olympic medal.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:44.580]   And also who's happiest?
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:47.360]   So gold medalists is up there best in the world.
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.140]   You might assume they're the happiest, right?
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:50.100]   And they are, they're smiling.
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.820]   The researchers analyze this by looking at facial expressions
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:55.100]   and kind of code the muscles and so on.
[02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:57.180]   But it turns out they're not the happiest, right?
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:58.020]   Who's the happiest?
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:18:59.660]   Well, let's look at the silver medalist.
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:00.620]   Are they happiest?
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:03.260]   No, in fact, actually, if you code their facial muscles,
[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:06.380]   they're showing expressions like contempt, deep sadness.
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:07.780]   This is the same expression you'd make
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.180]   like if your parent died
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:11.220]   or like, you know, a real terrible grief moment.
[02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:13.120]   This is the, I don't wanna adhere to this,
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.780]   but this is the quote unquote second place is first loser.
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:16.620]   - Yeah.
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:17.440]   - Kind of mindset.
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:18.280]   - 'Cause the idea is like, you know,
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.780]   who's your major comparison point if you're in silver,
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:22.460]   you know, 0.2 seconds or something,
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:23.660]   you would have gotten gold.
[02:19:23.660 --> 02:19:25.140]   And you're not feeling objectively
[02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:26.820]   like you're the second best on the planet.
[02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:30.060]   You beat all but one of billions of people on the planet.
[02:19:30.060 --> 02:19:31.620]   No, you just feel terrible.
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:33.260]   So that's silver medalist.
[02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:35.120]   What's going on with the bronze medalist, right?
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.420]   There's another person on the stand.
[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:38.300]   What's their comparison point?
[02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:39.120]   It's not gold.
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.540]   They were multiple people, multiple seconds away.
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:43.680]   Their salient comparison is like,
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:46.160]   by the grace of God, like I'm up here at all.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.840]   I almost like, you know, two seconds the other direction,
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:50.320]   I would have never gotten up here.
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.520]   And when you analyze the bronze medalist facial expressions,
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:54.680]   they're sometimes even happier than the gold medalist.
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:56.000]   Definitely happier than the silver,
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.180]   who's objectively better,
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:19:59.160]   but sometimes even happier than the gold medalist.
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:02.240]   'Cause they're like, relative to my comparison point,
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.320]   I'm doing amazing.
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.680]   - And the gold medalist is expected to get gold
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:09.240]   the next year or else it's pure reward prediction error.
[02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.580]   Especially if they internalize the expectations
[02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:14.700]   of the audience, the spectators, excuse me,
[02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:17.660]   because if they come back the next year
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:19.660]   and they're second or third on the podium
[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:20.580]   or not on the podium,
[02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:22.500]   it's seen as falling from a higher place.
[02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:23.340]   - Exactly.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:25.780]   This is a point that I make with my Ivy League students
[02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:27.140]   who've been perfect in their grades
[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:29.920]   and perfect at everything to get into a place like Yale,
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:32.140]   which is like, turns out that's a terrible recipe
[02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:32.980]   for happiness.
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:36.020]   - The only way forward is stay there down
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:36.860]   or create a new opportunity.
[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:37.740]   - Stay there you don't notice, right?
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:38.780]   'Cause you're habituated to it,
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:41.440]   just like the pattern down feels really bad.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:43.740]   Like that's a terrible comparison.
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:46.280]   I often play my students that DJ Khaled song,
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:48.400]   all I do is win, all I do is win, win, win.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.040]   And I was like, all you do is win, win, win
[02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:53.440]   would be a terrible way to experience success in life
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:56.760]   'cause you just stop noticing it over time if you won.
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:59.800]   And that's messed up because it means when you get,
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:03.600]   when you finally hit the success that you were striving for,
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.760]   if you just stay at that level,
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:08.120]   just stops being good, which sucks.
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:09.440]   And so that raises a different question,
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.320]   which is like, what is a hack that we can do
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:13.180]   to get away from that?
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:16.040]   One is to not look for the silver lining,
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:18.160]   but to look for the bronze lining,
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:20.640]   which is, you kind of think of reference points
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:21.480]   that are lower than you.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.120]   - I love a good conceptual pun,
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:24.760]   especially when it's framed in an experiment.
[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:25.680]   So thank you for that.
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:28.200]   - Yeah, it's like a science experiment is good, yes, yes.
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.340]   So look for the bronze lining,
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:32.700]   which means find a reference point that's not as good.
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:34.340]   And for most of the things you're comparing,
[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:36.220]   whether that's your looks, your fitness level,
[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:38.860]   your finances, you can look and find somebody
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:40.280]   that's doing worse than you.
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:42.440]   Another great hack for this,
[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:43.960]   and this is more one that's a kind of a hack
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:46.840]   for hedonic adaptation, getting used to stuff,
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:48.340]   actually comes from the ancient traditions.
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:51.360]   I know you talk a lot about smart folks back in the day
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:52.920]   who came up with this stuff, right?
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:54.500]   This is one from the Stoic tradition,
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:56.360]   a practice called negative visualization.
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:58.560]   So Stoics like Marcus Aurelius thought,
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:21:59.700]   when you wake up in the morning,
[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:01.360]   you should have the following thought pattern.
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:04.040]   You should think today, I will lose my success.
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:05.520]   I will be exiled.
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:06.440]   I'll lose my partner.
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:07.320]   I will lose my health.
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.640]   I won't be able to walk.
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:10.400]   It doesn't say ruminate on that for forever,
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:12.760]   but just like a little, and then stop and say,
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:14.440]   huh, I'm not exiled.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:15.480]   I still have my success.
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:17.200]   I still have my partner and so on.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:20.040]   This is a technique called negative visualization,
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.340]   where you just imagine,
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:22.560]   you don't have to live it in real life.
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:25.360]   You just imagine you lose something.
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:28.240]   If you've ever lost something you're hedonically adapted to,
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:31.640]   you know how quickly you recognize the value of it.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.000]   This happens to me with my phone all the time.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.280]   I'm a chronic phone loser.
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:36.000]   And I'm like, you know, and I'm like, oh my God,
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:36.840]   my phone is gone.
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:37.720]   I left it in the airport.
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:39.120]   All my contacts are there.
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.880]   And then I'm like, oh, it's in the car.
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:42.760]   You have this, I love my phone.
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:43.600]   Like, it's so valuable to me.
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.840]   - There's that line in Pulp Fiction where he says like,
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.680]   what is it?
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:49.720]   It's like, it's finding, at some point,
[02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:51.560]   I think it was Travolta says something,
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.720]   someone will know it, where, you know,
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:57.480]   finding it almost made losing it worth it.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:58.320]   - Exactly.
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:59.660]   - Like, because you appreciate it in a way
[02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:01.880]   that you didn't before, because it was taken away from you.
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:03.440]   - And that sucks to really lose your phone.
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.160]   Sometimes in my case, you really lost the phone, right?
[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:07.640]   But negative visualization, you don't have to do that.
[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:09.960]   You just use your imagination, right?
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:14.200]   And so if you're listening right now and you have a kid,
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:15.480]   let's do this negative visualization.
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:16.560]   The last time you saw your kid
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.280]   was the last time you ever saw them.
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:19.720]   Never gonna see them again.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:20.600]   Nope, didn't happen.
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:21.840]   You don't have to ruminate about it.
[02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:25.080]   But my guess is the next time you hug your kid,
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.520]   you'll hug, just that two seconds of rethinking
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:29.920]   about what things would be like without it
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.440]   can break through hedonic adaptation.
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:34.280]   So one of my favorite hacks for hedonic adaptation,
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:37.000]   you can use scarcity, really space things out,
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.240]   but for the things you can't space out,
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:40.360]   you can't like have a kid and get rid of a kid for two weeks
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:41.800]   and come back to your kid, right?
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:43.320]   You can use your imagination.
[02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:47.140]   It doesn't take much to start to realize what you have
[02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:49.080]   and appreciate it more, so.
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:52.400]   - I love this one mostly because I think most people,
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:54.040]   including myself, really,
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:57.040]   we want to avoid thinking negative stuff,
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:59.440]   especially on purpose, but what you're telling us
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:02.160]   is that it provides a wonderful contrast point
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:04.400]   to kind of trampoline off into the reality
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:05.840]   that is our current reality,
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:08.560]   which is far better than these horrible scenarios.
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:10.640]   - And I think this gets to another domain
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:13.320]   in which I see kind of toxic positivity playing out a lot,
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:15.640]   which is kind of in this sort of domain of like,
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:17.480]   how do we do this stuff better, right?
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:20.360]   Like how do we kind of get good things in life?
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:22.800]   And there's a lot of talk in some circles
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.800]   about this idea of like manifesting, right?
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:26.720]   I'll just think about, I'm feeling like,
[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:28.360]   I'll just think about what it's like to have friends
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:29.240]   or I'm not fit right now.
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:31.440]   I'll just imagine my fit future
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:33.960]   and fantasize about what it's like to run marathons
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:35.000]   and things like that.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.120]   Turns out this can be a case
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:41.360]   where you're using imagination in a bad way,
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:44.100]   because what happens when you really deeply imagine,
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:46.480]   say, the rewards of being super fit,
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:49.720]   you start to get, your brain's firing the reward cylinders
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:51.920]   for what it feels like to be super fit.
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:54.520]   And there's evidence from Gabrielle Oettingen's lab at NYU
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:57.440]   that you actually get less motivated to do stuff.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:58.840]   She does this in the context of fitness.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.960]   She has people who wanna run a 5K
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:01.960]   or wanna lose some weight.
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:03.840]   For example, they talk about like,
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:05.640]   imagine how great it would be to do this.
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:06.840]   And they're less motivated
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:08.560]   to put on their running shoes in practice
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:11.400]   because they've already imagined the fantasy future.
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:13.760]   Turns out instead of manifesting a better technique,
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:15.880]   if you have some habit that you wanna engage in,
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.080]   is to imagine the obstacles,
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:20.000]   the bad stuff that's coming up, right?
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.720]   So, oh, I wanna get out and run this 5K.
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:24.000]   Well, what's the obstacle to that?
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.760]   I'm gonna be in bed, alarm's gonna go off.
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.600]   What's gonna happen?
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:28.760]   Oh, I'm gonna be too warm.
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.320]   Like, maybe I put my running clothes on
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:32.000]   or, oh, like, I'm not gonna wanna,
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:32.840]   it's gonna be cold out.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:34.560]   Like, oh, I should get a nice fuzzy hat
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.800]   to be able to do this.
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:37.280]   This Oettingen's work shows
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:39.880]   that if you actually imagine the negative things,
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:41.560]   again, not ruminating about it and freaking out,
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:43.360]   but imagine particularly the obstacles
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.960]   for a habit you wanna engage in,
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:48.120]   you kind of naturally come up with solutions
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:49.760]   to those obstacles, which makes it easier.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:52.600]   So sometimes thinking about the bad stuff can be helpful.
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:55.160]   We just have to regulate when we do it.
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.200]   - I have a friend who's a cardiologist from UCSF
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.480]   and he says, you know, the danger of telling people
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:01.640]   that you're going to write a book
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:03.640]   or that you're going to start a podcast
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:04.920]   or that you're gonna start a company
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:07.280]   is that if you have very supportive friends
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:09.720]   and if you tend to be a pretty high agency person,
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:11.760]   you'll get a lot of praise and a lot of reward
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:13.640]   and there's a lower probability
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:14.760]   that you'll actually do the thing
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:16.320]   because you've derived some of the reward.
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:18.920]   Whereas if people tell you, you know,
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:20.440]   yeah, that seems kind of unlikely
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:22.040]   given that this and that, you know,
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:24.200]   it doesn't feel so good.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:26.560]   And obviously we wanna encourage each other.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:27.680]   This is the complicated thing.
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:31.400]   It's a, you know, it's a very narrow beam to walk on.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:32.480]   You wanna encourage people,
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:34.040]   but you don't wanna give them so much reward
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:36.960]   that then it undercuts their motivation.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:38.800]   And you certainly don't wanna discourage them
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:40.640]   to the point where they give up on themselves
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:41.960]   prior to even trying.
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:42.800]   - That's right.
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:45.420]   - But, you know, at least in the United States,
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:47.320]   probably in other countries too,
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:49.240]   goodness, do we love a story about somebody
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:53.000]   who was told like they couldn't do it and they did it.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.200]   You know, I think about the enormous popularity
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.400]   of David Goggins, who was, you know,
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:58.920]   had a truly difficult childhood
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:00.680]   and internalized all these messages
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:05.360]   of how terrible he was and then used those voices,
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:07.880]   other people's and his own in his head
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.000]   to push himself to do tremendously difficult things.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.480]   And then to continue to do tremendously difficult things
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:16.120]   and to self-publish one of the most, you know,
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:18.880]   popular self-published books of all time.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:21.640]   And then to go off and become a medic
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:23.520]   and now he's effectively doing the training
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.840]   of somebody going to medical school for his new training.
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.520]   Like he just refuses to stop.
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:31.860]   And it's, according to him, sat in that very chair and said,
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:35.160]   it's fueled by an internal voice of you can't do it.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:37.520]   And then he fights back against that voice,
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:40.600]   which is oh so different than manifesting
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.120]   this image of success.
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:42.960]   - Exactly.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:45.100]   And there's, again, this is a case where there's nuance.
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:46.680]   You have to believe it's possible, right?
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:48.720]   Those negative voices can't tell you it's impossible
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.720]   because something else we know about motivation
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.280]   is that believing something is possible,
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:57.160]   which requires lots of effort, but it is possible,
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:59.120]   is quite helpful for you.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:00.800]   The best example of this comes from another
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:02.560]   sort of sporting case.
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.280]   I don't know if you know the case of Roger Bannister,
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:07.620]   who's the first guy to run the four minute mile.
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.460]   - Break the four minute.
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:10.200]   - Break the four minute mile.
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.220]   And before he did that, people thought it was
[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:14.760]   like physiologically impossible.
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:16.280]   Like the human body cannot do this.
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:17.600]   And he was like, no, if the human body can do this,
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:19.560]   and everyone was like, Roger, you're crazy, whatever.
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:21.040]   But then he trained and trained
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.000]   and probably had to overcome his obstacles.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.300]   He ran it.
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:25.640]   And then within like two months,
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:26.920]   somebody else broke the four minute mile.
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:28.860]   Like it had not been broken in all of human history,
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:30.360]   but as soon as people had evidence of like,
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:32.760]   oh, people can do that, like now everybody does it.
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:33.600]   Now, I don't know.
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:35.160]   I mean, as you can see, I'm not a fit person,
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:36.720]   but like lots of people run four minute miles.
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:37.560]   It's not like the hugest thing.
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:38.560]   - High schoolers run it.
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:39.380]   - Yeah.
[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:40.440]   - Which is crazy, I mean.
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:41.840]   - But the point is that they're falling,
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:43.400]   they're probably helped out by this thing
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.600]   called the Bannister effect.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:46.480]   Like they know it's possible, right?
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:48.840]   So like if you train, if you run into obstacles,
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:50.400]   if you don't get that time, you're not like,
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.400]   well, I guess it's, you know, physiologically,
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:53.600]   I just can't do it.
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:54.440]   You can kind of do it.
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:56.960]   And so there's this idea with the Bannister effect,
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:58.680]   you kind of have to be optimistic enough
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:00.360]   to think that it's doable.
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:01.560]   But when you think that it's doable,
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:03.760]   it's really helpful to ask the question,
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:05.720]   okay, what are the things that are gonna come in the way
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:06.560]   of my doing it?
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:08.720]   And we imagine them really kind of vividly
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.480]   so you get a sense.
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:11.720]   It can super help it.
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.920]   - One of the things that contrasts a country like Denmark,
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:17.760]   for instance, compared to the United States,
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:20.000]   and I know this from discussions with my stepmother
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.200]   is that, you know, in this country,
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:24.960]   we have this notion because we have a lot of examples
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:28.720]   of people that went from absolutely nothing
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:31.440]   to these tremendously, quote, unquote, high places,
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:33.400]   financially, reputationally, et cetera,
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:36.540]   performance in whatever domain, sometimes overnight.
[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:41.360]   You know, this last year, I would say two events
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:45.480]   stick out in my mind as like, whoa, like, wow.
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:49.960]   The first was seeing the SpaceX rocket
[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:52.640]   get captured by the quote, unquote, chopsticks.
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:54.440]   That was just a rocket landing of all things.
[02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:55.880]   - So cool. - So cool.
[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:58.520]   Everybody, regardless of what else was going on
[02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:02.640]   with people's opinions of SpaceX or Elon or whatever,
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:04.120]   we're just like, whoa,
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:06.880]   that was just an awesome feat of engineering,
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:10.120]   just undeniably awesome feat of engineering.
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:13.560]   So it sets a bigger upper ceiling
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:15.160]   on what we thought was possible.
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:18.280]   We're seeing something that we hadn't seen before,
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:21.640]   at least not like that, not at that scale and resolution.
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:24.040]   So that changes what one conceptualize
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:27.000]   about what's possible in different aspects of life.
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.240]   And I think that's important, it lifts the ceiling.
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:33.100]   The other was very different example
[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:37.240]   was the overnight, the Haktua girl, right?
[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:38.560]   Who nobody knew of, right?
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:42.480]   Made a comment in a passing, you know, video on the street,
[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:43.700]   you know, one of these like,
[02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.560]   whatever spontaneous interview things.
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:47.680]   And then now has a quite successful podcast.
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:51.200]   It was ranked one of the highest new podcasts of the year.
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:53.720]   As far as I understand,
[02:30:53.720 --> 02:30:55.840]   has a staff and a thriving business now.
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:57.400]   And like, you know, took, you know,
[02:30:57.400 --> 02:30:59.680]   this is a very American thing, right?
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:03.940]   To go from an unknown to one or two quick comments
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:08.180]   to all of a sudden being a famous
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:11.840]   and presumably famous and somewhat wealthy person as well.
[02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:13.780]   And, you know, wish her nothing but luck
[02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:16.060]   in evolving that show. - Good luck, Haktua girl.
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:17.620]   - Yeah, good luck, yeah, sure.
[02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:20.540]   Like, I love to see people win, you know, like, okay.
[02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:22.060]   It was an unusual trajectory,
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:25.980]   but not so unusual for the United States in some sense.
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:27.580]   Because we also have the people who, you know,
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:29.620]   climb the staircase or the people that climb the staircase
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:31.220]   fell then came back, you know.
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:36.220]   We love and we cherish these stories in this country.
[02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:41.740]   And I think it frames the young mind in an interesting way.
[02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:44.480]   It sets this anything is possible.
[02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:47.160]   Oftentimes it takes clearly a ton of hard work.
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.040]   Oftentimes at the expense of other aspects
[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:52.740]   of one's mental or physical health or life, you know,
[02:31:52.740 --> 02:31:55.340]   life enrichment, family, et cetera.
[02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:59.140]   But it's a very American thing
[02:31:59.140 --> 02:32:02.320]   for people to be like, anything's possible.
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:04.820]   What do you think that does to our level of happiness?
[02:32:04.820 --> 02:32:08.860]   If we're somebody that, you know, is looking for happiness,
[02:32:08.860 --> 02:32:11.540]   wants a good life, wants resources,
[02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:16.540]   but doesn't, like, maybe they feel a little guilty
[02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:18.460]   that they're not as quote unquote ambitious
[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:19.300]   as everybody else.
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.420]   But then you contrast that with a country like Denmark,
[02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:22.900]   where people are very happy.
[02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:25.220]   They're certainly ambitious Danes,
[02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:27.180]   but they're actually, I was told that the word ambition
[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:30.340]   has a little bit of a pejorative, little bit,
[02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:33.020]   because you're not supposed to, you know, it's a very,
[02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:35.100]   you're not supposed to get that far ahead of anybody
[02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:37.940]   without acknowledging that you're still part of the pack.
[02:32:37.940 --> 02:32:39.780]   Forgive me Danes, but they're nice people.
[02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:40.900]   So they'll likely go easy on me.
[02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:41.740]   - No, no, no.
[02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:42.560]   - And I have Danish relatives.
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:46.460]   So, like, how do we take what's out and around us,
[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:49.200]   address who we are, and reconcile those things
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:51.780]   so that we're good with what we've got
[02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:53.460]   and know that we are good with what we've got?
[02:32:53.460 --> 02:32:54.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:56.340]   I mean, I think this is a spot where, you know,
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.540]   culture plays a big role.
[02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:59.220]   I think you're exactly right about Denmark.
[02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:02.340]   In fact, the Danes have this idea of Jante's law,
[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:05.260]   I'm probably pronouncing this poorly, but J-N-T-E's law,
[02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:07.660]   which is like, you're not really supposed to be better
[02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:09.980]   than anybody else, or like kind of showing off
[02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:11.820]   or like pushing yourself or thinking you're better,
[02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:14.060]   even the kind of maybe striving specific,
[02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:15.900]   not to be, you can strive to be better,
[02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:17.540]   but to strive to be better than other people
[02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:19.420]   is kind of, it's like a no-no.
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:21.580]   It's sort of culturally frowned upon
[02:33:21.580 --> 02:33:23.420]   in this way that I think is completely the opposite
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:24.540]   in the US right now, where like,
[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:26.820]   that's seen as an awesome thing.
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:28.220]   I think the problem is that these kind of
[02:33:28.220 --> 02:33:30.780]   rags to riches stories, you know,
[02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:33.860]   you've given cases of like ones that there's like a moment,
[02:33:33.860 --> 02:33:35.420]   right, in SpaceX, they do this wonderful thing.
[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:37.620]   You're like, yeah, they kind of got there.
[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:39.380]   And, you know, Hawk 2 is still doing her thing,
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:40.220]   but there was this moment of like,
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:42.580]   "Oh my gosh, she kind of achieved this success."
[02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:44.060]   There's this idea that we kind of think
[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:47.380]   that there's an end destination for something.
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:49.740]   You know, I'm gonna, you know, get $50 million,
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:50.660]   or I'm gonna get Marriott,
[02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:52.620]   or I'm gonna get that promotion at work, right?
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:54.140]   For my students, I'm gonna get into like
[02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:57.180]   a really elite college or something like that.
[02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:59.580]   We don't put our emphasis on the journey part.
[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:02.340]   We put our emphasis on the destination part.
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:04.460]   And we assume that the destination is gonna come
[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:06.300]   with a lot of happiness.
[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:08.060]   This is a bias that researchers have called
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:10.420]   the arrival fallacy, I'll be happy when.
[02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:11.980]   You know, it's almost like the happily ever after.
[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:13.980]   I'll be happily ever after if I get that promotion,
[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:16.420]   or happily ever after when I meet that person.
[02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:18.940]   And what we know from hedonic adaptation
[02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:20.780]   is that thing that's awesome in the moment
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:23.700]   when you arrive there quickly becomes the other thing.
[02:34:23.700 --> 02:34:25.260]   You mentioned briefly the gold medalists
[02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:26.300]   who have this moment where it's like,
[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:27.940]   they won the gold medal, and that's awesome.
[02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:30.460]   But now everything else is downhill,
[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:31.900]   or I just gotta do it again, right?
[02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:33.780]   We arrive at the best possible place
[02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:35.980]   we could have fantasized, and instantly it's like,
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:37.820]   I just have to start chasing the next carrot.
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:39.780]   So sometimes when we find ourselves,
[02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:43.620]   I think as Americans, you know, chasing after the thing,
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:45.340]   I think it's important to remember that first of all,
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:48.340]   that chase is gonna involve lots of ups and downs.
[02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:49.540]   It's not gonna be a linear path.
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:50.700]   It's probably not gonna be overnight.
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:52.580]   Even the ones you mentioned, maybe except,
[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:55.580]   with the exception of October, it was a really extreme case,
[02:34:55.580 --> 02:34:57.660]   required some kind of work and ups and downs
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:34:59.820]   and these kinds of things, right?
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:01.380]   We don't see those.
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:04.020]   But more, the happiness that we're gonna get,
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:06.940]   it's better off if we're going not for the end result,
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:09.460]   that arrival and falling prey to the arrival fallacy,
[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:13.620]   it's better if we can see some happiness in the journey.
[02:35:13.620 --> 02:35:15.180]   This has often been called this idea
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:16.820]   of sort of finding a journey mindset,
[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:18.500]   which is sort of what can you take
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:19.980]   from the process of getting there, right?
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:21.940]   So you wanna run your 5K, but like,
[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:25.460]   what can you do to try to enjoy the process of,
[02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:27.100]   you know, those runs that go along the way
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:28.900]   and noticing the kind of ups and downs
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:30.380]   and sort of paying attention to the journey.
[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:31.740]   It's one way to kind of break out
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:34.100]   of falling prey to this arrival fallacy.
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:35.860]   - Requires a serious frame shift.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:37.580]   - Totally, and I think one that, you know,
[02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:41.020]   is not culturally accepted in the US.
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:43.020]   And I think this causes a lot of, you know,
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:45.140]   it causes a happiness hit, not just 'cause like,
[02:35:45.140 --> 02:35:46.820]   sometimes we don't get there, sometimes there's a reason,
[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:49.860]   you know, if you set your height super high, you know,
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:51.780]   you wanna be Roger Bannister or whatever,
[02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:53.220]   like not all of us are gonna get there,
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:55.340]   whether that's a four minute mile or success at work
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:57.660]   or $50 million or whatever it is.
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.860]   So sometimes if you set your sights too high,
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:02.860]   you just don't get there and so that's a happiness hit.
[02:36:02.860 --> 02:36:05.020]   But a bigger happiness, and sometimes when you do get there,
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:06.300]   it's a happiness hit 'cause you get there
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:07.460]   and there's a happiness for a moment,
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:10.500]   but then, you know, that hit doesn't keep coming.
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:12.580]   I think we also just lose out on something
[02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:14.500]   when we're not in that journey mindset
[02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:16.820]   'cause there's a lot of cool stuff along the way
[02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:18.100]   if we can kind of pay attention.
[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:20.180]   But yeah, I think it's a big cultural shift
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:22.100]   from the way Americans usually think,
[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:24.020]   but if it's one that if we can achieve that,
[02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:26.700]   we'll start feeling a lot better.
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:28.820]   And it means even the failures in life are kind of good
[02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:31.140]   'cause you are enjoying yourself along the way.
[02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:32.540]   For my podcast, I did an episode
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:34.060]   about these sort of Olympic medals
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.260]   where I talked about that, you know,
[02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:38.780]   the bronze lining effect and things.
[02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:41.420]   And I had Michelle Kwan, who, you know,
[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:42.820]   Olympic medalist, we all remember her,
[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:44.700]   but mostly just won silver.
[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:46.900]   And I talked to her about, you know, what that felt like.
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:47.980]   And she said, "It didn't matter to me.
[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:49.300]   The things I love about being Olympics
[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:50.180]   wasn't the medal stand.
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:51.860]   It was when she first, she talked about
[02:36:51.860 --> 02:36:55.100]   putting her skates on and seeing the rings in the ice
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.900]   and recognizing as soon as I tie these laces,
[02:36:57.900 --> 02:37:00.460]   I'm gonna get to skate over those and I fantasize."
[02:37:00.460 --> 02:37:02.060]   That's the journey mindset, right?
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:03.900]   You're not looking at the thing at the end.
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:06.100]   You're paying enough attention to the stuff along the way,
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:08.100]   even some of the stuff that's a pain in the butt
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:10.740]   that you kind of get some joy on the ride.
[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:14.740]   - I certainly have learned to relish in the failures
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:16.820]   as well as the successes.
[02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:19.340]   And, you know, I think some of that also
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:20.700]   just comes with age.
[02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:21.860]   I've always wanted to say that.
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:23.340]   (both laughing)
[02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:24.180]   It's true though, it kind of comes with age.
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:25.460]   - You're old enough now, Andrew.
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:26.740]   You can jump into it.
[02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:28.660]   - Yeah, you accrue enough experiences,
[02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:31.220]   good and bad and neutral, and you kind of go like...
[02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:32.220]   The other day I was kind of like
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:33.660]   in this kind of weird state of mind.
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:35.740]   I was like, "Well, yeah, I've been here before.
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:37.100]   Like this shifts."
[02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:39.660]   Like, "No worries, like this shifts."
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:42.340]   And then sure enough, it shifted, you know?
[02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:44.260]   I think the first time we find ourself in a place
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:46.140]   or we find ourself back in a place
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:50.260]   and we forget we've been there before for whatever reason,
[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:51.820]   or we try and pretend we haven't been there before,
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:55.180]   it's like, and then you go through enough of those cycles.
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:57.700]   It's like, okay, this is part of a larger trajectory.
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:37:59.060]   This is the amazing thing about the brain
[02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:00.700]   I never understood, I still don't,
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:02.500]   which is that when we're feeling happy,
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:03.780]   we don't tend to think,
[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:05.420]   gosh, this feeling is gonna go away.
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:06.700]   Sometimes a little bit of that,
[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:08.540]   but when we're feeling lousy,
[02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:10.940]   it does seem to do something to our sense of time,
[02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:13.940]   our time perception that makes it seem,
[02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:16.460]   especially in the real lows and the real trenches,
[02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:17.780]   that it's gonna go on forever.
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:19.380]   We can't imagine feeling differently.
[02:38:19.380 --> 02:38:22.820]   The "this too shall pass" is very hard to internalize
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:23.900]   when we're in those states.
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:25.740]   - Totally, but it can make you feel a lot.
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:28.660]   If you can get that distance from your current state,
[02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:29.500]   and this is a kind of, you know,
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:31.900]   you had Ethan Cross on the show that he talks a lot a lot.
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.300]   If you can kind of get that distance of,
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:35.540]   well, how's this gonna feel in five years?
[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:36.860]   How's this gonna feel in 10 years?
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:38.740]   You can sometimes feel a lot better.
[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:40.900]   Interestingly, even when the happy stuff,
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:42.220]   if we can get some sense
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:44.460]   that like this isn't going to last forever,
[02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:46.900]   that can sometimes boost the happiness.
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:48.100]   'Cause we're kind of almost doing
[02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:49.580]   like a negative visualization
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:51.780]   in the forward direction, right?
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:53.700]   So a scarce experience, if you're having it,
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:55.700]   it's useful to remember like, you know,
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:38:56.780]   this is limited, right?
[02:38:56.780 --> 02:38:57.900]   This is temporary.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:00.700]   I should enjoy this now while it's happening.
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:02.460]   The most extreme version of this, of course,
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:04.340]   is with our own lives, right?
[02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:06.380]   Contemplating our mortality.
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:08.940]   There's this idea of memento mori,
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:09.940]   which is a common phrase.
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:13.220]   I actually have my ring has memento mori on it,
[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:14.460]   which is morbid, right?
[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:15.300]   I'm gonna die.
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:16.140]   I'm not gonna be here.
[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:18.140]   But when you recognize that, you know,
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:20.580]   the old school folks thought, and I think it's true.
[02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:21.780]   Like you realize like,
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:23.820]   I can't take any of this stuff for granted.
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:25.180]   I have to pay attention now.
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:26.300]   This is not, you know,
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:27.820]   the kind of thing that's gonna last forever.
[02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:30.940]   And so I think moments like that for positive experiences
[02:39:30.940 --> 02:39:31.780]   can feel like that.
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:34.220]   You know, if you're tasting a delicious glass
[02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:36.420]   of Pinot Noir sitting, yesterday I was,
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:38.420]   and you know, while I'm here, you know,
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:40.220]   took a walk on Santa Monica Beach and was like,
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:42.300]   you know, my brain was like, oh, I have to,
[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:43.140]   Andrew coming out.
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:44.220]   I was like, no, no, no.
[02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:46.460]   I'm gonna like fly back to cold, you know,
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:47.380]   East Coast tomorrow.
[02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:49.300]   I need to pay attention, right?
[02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:52.420]   So thinking that this is finite can actually help you.
[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:55.340]   There's a very funny study on this with college students
[02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:57.580]   where they did this sort of funny framing technique
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:00.860]   where they brought senior college students into lab,
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:02.460]   you know, kind of halfway through, you know,
[02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:04.500]   the spring semester and told them, you know,
[02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:06.980]   you either have this many hours less of your time,
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:08.340]   which maybe is a big number, you know,
[02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:09.940]   it makes it seem like thousands of hours,
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:12.820]   or you have only this many days left before you graduate.
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:14.460]   Just like, just a reminder.
[02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:16.700]   What they found was the one that got the days manipulation
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:18.180]   where it felt kind of short,
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:20.300]   they wound up doing more things,
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:21.940]   like kind of getting in those things that they thought,
[02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:23.580]   oh, I'll get around to it eventually
[02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.220]   and wound up kind of feeling happier.
[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:28.260]   So recognizing that things are short sometimes
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:30.700]   has a benefit, maybe both for negative emotions,
[02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:32.620]   like this too shall pass,
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:35.060]   but also the positive stuff, like this too shall pass.
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:37.420]   So I got to enjoy it while it's around.
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:40.900]   - It's so interesting because it's kind of counterintuitive
[02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:44.460]   that realizing that something positive is also fleeting
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:46.860]   allows us to savor it more.
[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:50.300]   Because from an uninformed perspective,
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:51.140]   one could imagine, okay,
[02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:53.780]   so you're at a great meal with people you love,
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:57.180]   and it's been, let's even say it's been a rough month before
[02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:58.380]   and you're like really in it.
[02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:00.460]   And someone says, well, you know,
[02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:01.980]   like this too is going to pass.
[02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:04.460]   And you're like, that sounds like kind of a downer, right?
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:07.940]   But then if it allows you to savor it more, that's key.
[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:10.340]   So yeah, there does seem to be this inverse relationship
[02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:13.460]   between sad states and happy states,
[02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:15.400]   where when we are in sad states,
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.540]   we feel like it will go on forever
[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:19.480]   and we'll do almost anything to get out of those
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:21.420]   unless they've completely collapsed us.
[02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:24.420]   In our happy states,
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:27.340]   we don't want to be reminded that it will pass.
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:28.900]   And this is why I think in part,
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:31.260]   not the only reason why people will take
[02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:33.220]   mood altering drugs.
[02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:34.820]   I'm talking about this in the recreational sense,
[02:41:34.820 --> 02:41:37.140]   like to sort of forget everything else
[02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:39.620]   and forget that whatever they're experiencing
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:40.700]   is gonna wear off.
[02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:41.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:43.140]   And I think, you know,
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:45.900]   it's not nice to think that these good states
[02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:47.060]   are gonna pass,
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:48.020]   but I think it is helpful
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:49.660]   'cause it forces us to pay attention to them.
[02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:51.220]   I'm having this a little bit now where, you know,
[02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:52.460]   we're coming up on the holidays
[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:54.220]   that I'm, you and I are having this conversation
[02:41:54.220 --> 02:41:57.180]   and, you know, I'm getting ready to do the holidays
[02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:58.580]   with the in-laws, you know,
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:41:59.820]   which there's lots of positive.
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:01.980]   So it's like, oh God, I don't wanna.
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:06.020]   But because my in-laws, my mom is getting up there,
[02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:06.860]   I'm kind of like,
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:10.240]   oh, recognizing that there's not infinite holidays left
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.620]   with these people that I care about,
[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:12.900]   that it's kind of more finite
[02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:15.420]   and maybe more finite than it's been.
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:17.280]   It's causing me to be more excited about it
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:18.120]   than I would have been.
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:20.300]   And so, and that's a morbid thought, right?
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:21.540]   Memento mori was meant to be
[02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:23.100]   a really bittersweet emotion, right?
[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:25.340]   That we are finite, right?
[02:42:25.340 --> 02:42:28.020]   But it can kind of give you this appreciation.
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.740]   It can cause you to savor in a special way.
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:31.700]   So sometimes the morbid is good.
[02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:32.940]   A little bit, a little bit morbid.
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:34.220]   - It's the contrast again.
[02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:35.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:36.060]   - It's the contrast.
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:37.740]   And maybe it's why people watch horror movies.
[02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:38.740]   I'm not into horror movies,
[02:42:38.740 --> 02:42:40.940]   but so that, you know, maybe you feel safer.
[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:42.660]   I don't know, that stuff always made me feel terrified
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:44.620]   if I was, you know, watch some of that late at night.
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:46.100]   - High amygdala reaction, me too, me too.
[02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:46.940]   I hate horror movies,
[02:42:46.940 --> 02:42:49.460]   but it's worth noting that like, you know,
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:52.340]   a lot of people like them, you know, huge industry.
[02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:53.680]   And even if you don't like horror movies,
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:54.740]   you might like, you know,
[02:42:54.740 --> 02:42:57.740]   maybe a spicy food that feels not even good.
[02:42:57.740 --> 02:42:58.860]   It feels awful in the moment,
[02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:00.460]   or super hot bath, or, you know,
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:02.620]   cold, like a really cold plunge, right?
[02:43:02.620 --> 02:43:03.820]   - I like getting out of the cold plunge
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:05.580]   for exactly the reason we're talking about.
[02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:07.260]   - Yeah, or even, you know, honestly, for me,
[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:09.040]   like I'm not a super fan of exercise,
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:12.220]   but like a really, really hard workout that feels miserable.
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:14.040]   When you finally stop, it feels,
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:16.860]   I do a lot of yoga and my favorite thing is at the end
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:18.700]   when they're like, and now you can do shavasana.
[02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:20.820]   Shavasana is always good if you've worked the worst,
[02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:22.580]   like you're just really like, ha.
[02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:25.380]   You know, it's helpful to kind of have these moments,
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:26.940]   to like have this contrast.
[02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:28.900]   And so building the contrast in
[02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:31.660]   where you kind of give yourself some negative emotion,
[02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:33.740]   you know, whether it's a kind of imagine negative emotion,
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:36.180]   like negative visualization, or a fictional one.
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:38.700]   A lot of our favorite fictional experiences
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:39.700]   are pretty terrible.
[02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:42.140]   Like a novel's really boring if the protagonist's like,
[02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:43.220]   there's nothing bad happened,
[02:43:43.220 --> 02:43:44.380]   they're just gonna coast along
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:46.020]   and things are just mildly positive.
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:48.100]   No, we want them to go through some terrible stuff,
[02:43:48.100 --> 02:43:50.580]   even when we really associate with them
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:52.060]   and sort of see them as ourselves.
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:54.580]   And so, yeah, these like fictional worlds
[02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:57.740]   where we can play with negative emotions a little bit
[02:43:57.740 --> 02:43:59.280]   are super interesting psychologically,
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:00.540]   'cause like, why would we do that?
[02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:01.460]   But, you know, as you're saying,
[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:04.280]   even when you get, you know, these like neural stimulation,
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:06.020]   we kind of want some of the negative stuff.
[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:09.060]   So there's an interesting paper
[02:44:09.060 --> 02:44:11.020]   about what's the right ratio of positive
[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:12.940]   to negative emotions.
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.780]   And it's not 100% positives for hedonic adaptation
[02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:17.980]   and so on, but I think really the recipe
[02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:20.180]   for a rich life is varied
[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:22.340]   for these contrast reasons we've been talking about.
[02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:23.580]   - So what's the ideal ratio?
[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:24.420]   - They don't know.
[02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:25.260]   - Oh, they don't know, okay.
[02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:26.080]   - They didn't figure it out.
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:27.140]   It was like, boom, it's like exactly.
[02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:29.020]   - 60/40, positive/negative.
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:30.620]   (laughing)
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:33.340]   You're obviously anticipating a number.
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:35.060]   - And I think it's also worth remembering
[02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:36.940]   that, you know, we're talking as though
[02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:38.900]   there are negative emotions and positive emotions.
[02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:40.860]   You know, a lot of the most interesting emotions
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:42.460]   are more complex than that.
[02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:43.540]   You talked about this, you know,
[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:46.280]   SpaceX kind of chopsticks moment.
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:48.620]   My guess is the emotion you're experiencing there
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:50.620]   is one that researchers like Dacher Keltner
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:52.100]   and colleagues would call awe, right?
[02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:54.940]   This sense of, oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:56.420]   There's something bigger than me
[02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:58.540]   that like is able to do this thing.
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:00.740]   And one of the reasons awe is such an interesting emotion
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:02.820]   is it's usually destabilizing, right?
[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:05.500]   They're like things that are better than I ever expected.
[02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:07.220]   You know, humankind is so masterful,
[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:10.300]   space is so big, nature is so vast, right?
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:12.700]   It kind of feels a little destabilizing
[02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:15.900]   when you experience awe, but we also see it as positive.
[02:45:15.900 --> 02:45:19.340]   And so I think kind of if you're feeling a little bored
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:21.500]   in your emotional life, trying to find moments
[02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:23.500]   where you can get these emotions
[02:45:23.500 --> 02:45:26.100]   that are not so obviously positive or negative,
[02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:29.220]   but are a little bit of both can be really inspiring.
[02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:30.060]   It's one of the reasons, you know,
[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:32.000]   we talk a lot about sort of psychedelics
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.960]   and these sort of altered experiences.
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:36.460]   Those experiences tend to be thought of
[02:45:36.460 --> 02:45:38.940]   as being really consistent with moments of awe,
[02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:41.020]   but they again are not universally positive,
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:43.540]   but they kind of expand you and take you a little further.
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:45.860]   - I can attest that they're not universally positive.
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:47.020]   (both laughing)
[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:49.100]   Sometimes they're terrifying,
[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:50.900]   even in their clinical application.
[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:54.300]   The thing I appreciated about the rocket landing
[02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:57.380]   was that indeed I feel awe looking up at the stars at night
[02:45:57.380 --> 02:45:59.940]   or just thinking about how we're having this conversation
[02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:01.940]   in a room and all, and then expanding out
[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:04.780]   to like we're a little object floating in the universe.
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:06.220]   And that can be a bit overwhelming.
[02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:07.740]   What's I think incredible is that
[02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:10.580]   through the harnessing of engineering and physics,
[02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:12.220]   SpaceX was able to create something
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:16.420]   that was so well controlled at a scale
[02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:19.440]   that I'm normally accustomed to thinking about things.
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:22.300]   Sure, I've seen planes and we landed on the moon, et cetera.
[02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:24.780]   Some people will debate that, but we were on the moon.
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:26.180]   I wasn't, but somebody was.
[02:46:26.180 --> 02:46:32.100]   To see control and harnessing of physics and engineering
[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:34.820]   at a scale that is certainly not at the scale
[02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:35.780]   of the entire galaxies,
[02:46:35.780 --> 02:46:37.740]   but it's starting to approach outer space
[02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:39.460]   and back again, clearly.
[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:41.820]   And in such a, I think it was the slowing
[02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:44.540]   of that enormously large object
[02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:47.260]   and the capture that felt so gratifying.
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:50.780]   I also think, and this can explain a fair amount
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:52.620]   of human technological evolution
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:55.340]   is that the human brain either delights in
[02:46:55.340 --> 02:47:00.340]   or at least marvels in creating action at a distance.
[02:47:00.340 --> 02:47:02.100]   I mean, think about what went into creating
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:05.100]   that amount of action in an object
[02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:07.780]   with that much mass at a distance, right?
[02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:10.140]   And then you can layer through all the things
[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:11.780]   where we're looking at it on our phones, on our screens.
[02:47:11.780 --> 02:47:14.420]   I mean, all that technology is relatively recent.
[02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:17.460]   And to think that us human beings,
[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:20.460]   as opposed to macaque monkeys could do that.
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:23.780]   Like we are the primate species that is so far ahead
[02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:26.260]   in terms of technological development
[02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:28.740]   compared to every other species on the planet.
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:32.980]   The only other species of life that might be besting us
[02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:35.180]   and we don't know is I've heard this theory.
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:37.340]   It's rather entertaining,
[02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:39.180]   which is that all these trillions of microorganisms
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:40.980]   that live in our gut microbiome,
[02:47:40.980 --> 02:47:42.780]   what if we're just vehicles for them to get around
[02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:44.140]   and pass to one another?
[02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:48.620]   And they're just, they have a sort of a consciousness
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.460]   that is all about just propagating.
[02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.260]   And that we think that we're doing all this stuff
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:54.540]   for some evolution, but it's just to keep the microbiota.
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:55.380]   I don't really believe that by the way.
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:56.900]   - Finally, we could get to space
[02:47:56.900 --> 02:47:58.700]   where we could really evolve the microbiota.
[02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:00.660]   - And they just want more microbiota.
[02:48:00.660 --> 02:48:02.420]   So, that we're being hijacked.
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:04.820]   I chuckle at that theory.
[02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:05.660]   I don't actually think that's the way it is.
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:08.060]   - Yeah, there's, we talked about too few studies
[02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:09.620]   of dog and primate cognition,
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:12.020]   way too few studies of microbiota cognition,
[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:12.860]   unfortunately.
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:18.860]   - This is probably the right time to say
[02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:21.620]   that we are a storytelling species.
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:22.700]   This is what we're doing right now.
[02:48:22.700 --> 02:48:24.900]   We're creating story around these things
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:26.060]   that we can't quite explain.
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:28.780]   And during the course of today's conversation,
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:32.700]   I realized that this thing that we call happiness
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:35.340]   has at least three levels or layers
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:36.460]   that we filter it through.
[02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:38.460]   When we ask ourselves, are we happy?
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:40.780]   How do I be happier?
[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:43.060]   This element of contrast with negative experiences
[02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:44.900]   seems to be a repeating theme.
[02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:48.580]   Memento mori being negative sort of dark cloud
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:50.540]   from which we're supposed to see the light
[02:48:50.540 --> 02:48:52.980]   and act in the light.
[02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:54.860]   This exists in religious narratives,
[02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:58.940]   philosophical narratives and scientific reality.
[02:48:58.940 --> 02:49:02.180]   I could imagine three layers.
[02:49:02.180 --> 02:49:04.580]   The first is sensory experience.
[02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:06.220]   The reason to take a cold shower, folks,
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:07.060]   in addition to the fact
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:08.980]   that it'll save you on your heating bill
[02:49:08.980 --> 02:49:11.580]   is that the warm shower that follows,
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:13.780]   in fact, that's how I do it, feels so good.
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:15.220]   10 times better than it would
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:17.460]   if you had just gotten into the warm shower, I promise.
[02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:19.420]   Same thing about getting out of the cold plunge.
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:20.940]   You know, there's a lot of debate about these things,
[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:23.500]   but this is just pure sensory experience
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:26.100]   and contrast of the sort that we're talking about today.
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:28.540]   Hunger and then eating a delicious piece of food
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:30.220]   or eating a not so delicious piece of food,
[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:32.860]   but you're hungry and so it's that much more delicious.
[02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:33.820]   Okay.
[02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:35.300]   Million examples we could spiral towards.
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:36.500]   So there's sensory experience.
[02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:39.380]   There's raw sensory perception and experience
[02:49:39.380 --> 02:49:41.420]   from which the contrast creates this thing
[02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:46.220]   that we like feel better, aka happiness, sort of.
[02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:47.740]   Then there's story.
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:50.140]   Like, God, last year was a tough year.
[02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:51.740]   This year was better.
[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:53.260]   There's also, and I've seen this before,
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:55.540]   like we were killing it for two years
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:57.420]   and then this year was kind of a meh year.
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:59.020]   This is not the case, by the way,
[02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:01.540]   but I'm very fortunate the podcast has continued
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:02.500]   to grow and expand.
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:04.900]   But for some people, they're not as happy
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:06.580]   with their whatever salary this year,
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:08.220]   because even though it's spectacular
[02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:10.500]   by somebody else's standards, by their standard,
[02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.260]   it's down from previous years.
[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:14.420]   So there's the story that we create
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:16.360]   that it's not sensory experience.
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:18.980]   It's perception based on dopamine
[02:50:18.980 --> 02:50:20.500]   and it's perception based on reward
[02:50:20.500 --> 02:50:22.420]   and punishment, et cetera.
[02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:25.500]   And then there's this third layer, which is meaning.
[02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:27.180]   Like you said, yeah, you know,
[02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:29.620]   spending time with in-laws, like, okay,
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:31.540]   every moment of it might not be as awesome
[02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:33.540]   as you might like, but there's meaning
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:35.820]   in spending time with people that are extended family,
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:40.060]   especially when elders and younger are in the same room.
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:43.940]   There's something really, it layers on story
[02:50:43.940 --> 02:50:48.020]   to create this sort of other level that we call meaning.
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:49.220]   And so what I'm realizing is that
[02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:51.100]   these are three timescales.
[02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:52.880]   So we have the immediate timescale of happiness.
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:54.060]   We have the kind of intermediate one
[02:50:54.060 --> 02:50:55.460]   where we introduce a story.
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:50:56.300]   And then we have meaning,
[02:50:56.300 --> 02:50:59.500]   which is kind of like this whole picture.
[02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:02.580]   So it seems to me that we need to approach happiness
[02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:04.340]   from all three levels,
[02:51:04.340 --> 02:51:08.500]   that it's not enough to just be like a dog,
[02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:10.420]   which are in the sensory experience,
[02:51:10.420 --> 02:51:13.060]   presumably of happiness.
[02:51:13.060 --> 02:51:15.820]   If they tell stories, they don't tell them to us.
[02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:17.500]   And if they have meaning, I don't know,
[02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:20.540]   but they seem to like nailed the first level.
[02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:22.700]   And they're probably five more.
[02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:23.820]   - And they probably don't have the capacity
[02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:24.660]   to do the other two.
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:25.740]   - It's not like they're not doing it
[02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:26.700]   and kind of missing out.
[02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:27.740]   They kind of have brains
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:29.380]   that don't let them notice they're missing out.
[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:30.580]   But we unfortunately have brains
[02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.660]   that would feel like we were really missing out.
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:35.300]   If we just had the sensory experiences
[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:36.380]   without the good stories,
[02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:37.860]   I think you're sort of pointing to this idea
[02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:39.260]   that sort of being happy in your life
[02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:40.380]   and being happy with your life,
[02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:42.340]   the with your life part has the kind of
[02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:44.660]   medium timescale stories,
[02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:46.380]   but also the really big ones, right?
[02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:47.380]   You know, is my life,
[02:51:47.380 --> 02:51:49.300]   am I doing anything really meaningful with my life?
[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:51.140]   Am I finding purpose and so on?
[02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:52.880]   The funny thing though,
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:54.940]   is when you get to that big timescale
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:57.180]   to find a sense of purpose and stuff like that,
[02:51:57.180 --> 02:51:59.660]   sometimes it pays to do stuff at the local level,
[02:51:59.660 --> 02:52:02.580]   at the medium and shorter term timescale.
[02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:04.420]   And one of the things researchers have found
[02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:06.680]   is that if you're engaging in activities
[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:08.340]   at the short term timescales
[02:52:08.340 --> 02:52:10.180]   that kind of fit with your value,
[02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:11.620]   so what these positive psychologists
[02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:13.900]   have often called your strengths,
[02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:16.020]   that can be a way to sort of achieve purpose.
[02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:16.840]   So what are strengths?
[02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:18.980]   So researchers do this thing where they wanna look at like
[02:52:18.980 --> 02:52:21.380]   all the valuable things people can do out in the world,
[02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:23.500]   right? And so what are the things that you value?
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:25.500]   And folks like Chris Peterson and colleagues
[02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.500]   have come up with this list of what they call
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:28.780]   different character strengths.
[02:52:28.780 --> 02:52:29.980]   And there are things that like, you know,
[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:32.180]   you can actually, if you Google online character strengths,
[02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:33.300]   you'll get the big list.
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:35.580]   Often people talk about there being 24,
[02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:38.100]   but they're just universally good things like being brave,
[02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:40.020]   be, you know, citizenship, humor,
[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:41.540]   like, you know, social intelligence,
[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:42.740]   love of learning, right?
[02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:44.760]   You know, kind of empathy, fairness, right?
[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:47.720]   These kinds of sets of values that we have.
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:50.860]   People differ in how much they value one or the other,
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.700]   you know, so I could ask you, Andrew, like, what's better,
[02:52:52.700 --> 02:52:54.220]   like bravery or humor?
[02:52:54.220 --> 02:52:56.060]   Probably both pretty high for you, I would imagine.
[02:52:56.060 --> 02:52:59.440]   But like about prudence versus love of learning,
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:00.280]   I have a guess.
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:03.420]   - Yeah, I mean, if I had to pick between bravery and humor,
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:05.860]   I think bravery is probably more important to me.
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:06.700]   - More humor, yeah.
[02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:09.140]   - I mean, I love humor, but if I had to pick,
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:11.140]   it's sort of like, you know, steak and coffee,
[02:53:11.140 --> 02:53:11.980]   I'm going steak.
[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:13.860]   - Yeah, okay, well, the point is we,
[02:53:13.860 --> 02:53:15.660]   there are individual differences in this
[02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:17.580]   and there are formal tests you can do online.
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:19.940]   If you Google the VIA character strengths test,
[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:21.780]   you'll see these 24 and you can do one of these
[02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:24.860]   very systematic, you know, kind of tests to do it.
[02:53:24.860 --> 02:53:26.020]   But really just trying to think about like,
[02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:28.660]   what are the values that you value?
[02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:30.180]   And the ones that come to mind as being
[02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:32.540]   particularly about you, the ones that you resonate with
[02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:34.180]   are what somebody like Chris Peterson
[02:53:34.180 --> 02:53:35.600]   would call your signature strengths.
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:37.700]   They're the ones that when you execute them,
[02:53:37.700 --> 02:53:39.420]   you kind of feel like things are meaningful
[02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:41.180]   and purposeful and so on.
[02:53:41.180 --> 02:53:46.020]   And so the idea is that one recipe for a purposeful life
[02:53:46.020 --> 02:53:49.880]   at the local level is trying to engage in behaviors
[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:52.740]   that allow you to use more of these values or strengths.
[02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:56.340]   And one of my favorite pieces of research
[02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:57.820]   that looks at both the power of this
[02:53:57.820 --> 02:53:59.500]   and how, even though if it seems like
[02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:01.540]   that those are hard things to bring in,
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:03.420]   like you should bring them in more,
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:05.340]   is some work by this woman, Amy Resnensky,
[02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:07.340]   who's a professor at the University of Pennsylvania
[02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:10.820]   and she does these studies on what she calls job crafting,
[02:54:10.820 --> 02:54:12.780]   which is a practice where you take
[02:54:12.780 --> 02:54:15.380]   your normal job description as whatever your job is
[02:54:15.380 --> 02:54:17.260]   and figure out ways that you can infuse
[02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:18.780]   your signature strengths into them.
[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:20.200]   You know, so if you're a podcaster,
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:22.140]   if your signature strength was bravery,
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:23.880]   you could bring in guests that made me
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:25.480]   feel a little bit intimidating to you,
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:27.400]   probably like me, I imagine.
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:28.920]   Or like you could take on topics
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:30.200]   that are a little bit harder, right,
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:31.880]   that kind of push you a little bit, right?
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:33.320]   If your signature strength was humor,
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:35.520]   you'd add more company or make more jokes.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.180]   If it was love of learning, you'd pick topics
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:38.380]   that like you didn't know anything about,
[02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:39.880]   but you kind of dive in, right?
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:41.720]   You take whatever your normal job description
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:44.160]   is and you find a way to build in your strengths.
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:46.160]   And the reason I love Amy's work so much
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:48.240]   is that she studies signature strengths
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:51.140]   not in academics like us who have very flexible jobs
[02:54:51.140 --> 02:54:53.720]   or podcasters, she studies signature strengths
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:56.620]   in hospital janitorial staff workers
[02:54:56.620 --> 02:54:57.640]   who are, you know, these are people
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:54:59.680]   that are cleaning the linen in a hospital room
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:00.880]   or mopping the floors and stuff.
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:03.780]   Not a job where you think there's lots of flexibility
[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:05.740]   or you could build in things like, you know,
[02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:07.980]   humor and love of learning and the stuff.
[02:55:07.980 --> 02:55:10.180]   But she finds interestingly that like around
[02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:13.420]   a quarter to a third of these janitorial staff workers
[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:16.460]   say that their job is a calling, they love it,
[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:18.300]   they get a lot of purpose from it.
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:20.760]   And they're the ones that are naturally building in
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:22.020]   their signature strengths.
[02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:24.440]   And she tells in her work, she tells these lovely stories.
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:26.360]   There's a story of a janitorial staff worker
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:28.760]   who worked in a chemotherapy ward.
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:31.140]   And if you've been unlucky enough to have cancer
[02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:33.240]   and had to have chemotherapy or know someone who did,
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:34.960]   you know that people tend to get really sick
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:36.640]   'cause the medicine makes people really nauseous.
[02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:38.660]   So a big part of this guy's job
[02:55:38.660 --> 02:55:40.920]   was like cleaning up vomit basically.
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:42.920]   But he said, you know, my job isn't to clean up vomit,
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:45.560]   my strengths are like humor and social intelligence.
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:47.340]   And what I do is I make a joke.
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:49.460]   This is somebody who's having a really crappy day
[02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:51.180]   and I'm gonna do something that's gonna make them laugh.
[02:55:51.180 --> 02:55:53.500]   And if I do that, then I won, it's not my paycheck.
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:55.000]   And I guess he had a standard joke, which was like,
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.300]   oh my God, let's clear a big pile of vomit over time,
[02:55:57.300 --> 02:55:58.140]   like for me.
[02:55:58.140 --> 02:55:59.460]   And like, you know, you're laughing,
[02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:00.820]   listeners probably laughing.
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:02.840]   He's like, that's my job.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:05.300]   I talked to another worker who worked in a coma ward.
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:08.180]   So this individual couldn't talk to the patients
[02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:11.420]   because they're in comas, but her strength was creativity.
[02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:13.460]   And so every day she like moved the artwork
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:14.720]   and the plants around, you know,
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:16.640]   just kind of created some changes.
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:18.720]   And she thought maybe that would pop people
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:19.560]   out of their coma.
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:21.240]   I don't know if that's medically plausible, probably not,
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:23.000]   but it doesn't matter to her.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.120]   She felt like she was executing her creativity.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:28.840]   And so the moral of this job crafting work is,
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:30.280]   no matter what your job is,
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:33.760]   there's probably some room to building some more purpose.
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:35.720]   If you take some time to think about like,
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:36.560]   what are the strengths?
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:37.800]   What are the things that get you going?
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:40.240]   If you need a tip, you can kind of Google these things.
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:41.920]   But then how could I infuse that
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:43.740]   into my normal job description?
[02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:46.360]   And there's probably a lot more flexibility
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:47.200]   than you think.
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:48.900]   You don't need to quit your job and become a podcaster
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:50.620]   to like get this flexibility.
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:51.660]   Probably whatever you do,
[02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:54.660]   there's some window where you can build that in.
[02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:55.900]   - That's awesome.
[02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:58.140]   Those are awesome stories.
[02:56:58.140 --> 02:56:59.740]   I also was just thinking about the janitor
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:00.580]   cleaning up the vomit,
[02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:03.780]   like to like restore some dignity to these people
[02:57:03.780 --> 02:57:05.860]   that clearly know they're making a mess
[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:08.740]   and like, you know, humor being the ultimate bridge.
[02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:12.400]   And darn it, why'd you make me have to choose
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:13.640]   between humor and the other thing?
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:14.480]   But humor is so awesome.
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:15.840]   - Sorry, now you're like, humor's pretty good.
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:16.680]   - Now I'm rethinking my answer.
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:19.120]   - It's very brave to clean up vomit as well, I think, right?
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:23.360]   - Yeah, and to bring humor to a place where, you know,
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:26.720]   some people might presume humor is not allowed.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:28.120]   Goodness.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:30.160]   The signature strengths in the list of,
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:32.120]   you said 24 of them,
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:34.320]   where can people learn more about these signature strengths?
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:36.200]   I think this would be a really powerful exercise.
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:37.720]   And we can always find the link
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:39.420]   and put it in the show note captions.
[02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:42.020]   But is there like a place that people can find this stuff?
[02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:46.460]   - The values in action is viacharacterstrengths.org.
[02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:47.500]   So I can share the link
[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:48.780]   and you can stick it in your show notes.
[02:57:48.780 --> 02:57:50.380]   But yeah, people can go on there for free
[02:57:50.380 --> 02:57:52.060]   and do one of these kind of, you know,
[02:57:52.060 --> 02:57:54.260]   formal psychometric tests where you measure your strengths,
[02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:55.340]   see what they are.
[02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:56.460]   And it's a fun website too,
[02:57:56.460 --> 02:57:58.020]   because you get to kind of,
[02:57:58.020 --> 02:57:59.260]   they give you some suggestions.
[02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:00.420]   'Cause some of these, you know,
[02:58:00.420 --> 02:58:02.220]   values are like prudence is one of them.
[02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:03.780]   It's like, how do I exercise prudence?
[02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:06.020]   And they'll have, you know, these are different things.
[02:58:06.020 --> 02:58:07.220]   They also make the suggestion,
[02:58:07.220 --> 02:58:10.260]   this is a homework assignment I give in my happiness class
[02:58:10.260 --> 02:58:12.580]   of suggesting you do this with a good friend
[02:58:12.580 --> 02:58:13.580]   or a romantic partner.
[02:58:13.580 --> 02:58:15.180]   Have each of you do this
[02:58:15.180 --> 02:58:17.800]   and find strengths that you share together.
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:19.100]   And then you can go on
[02:58:19.100 --> 02:58:21.140]   what researchers call a strength state,
[02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:22.700]   where, you know, if you both have bravery,
[02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:24.140]   then that means you guys should do the,
[02:58:24.140 --> 02:58:25.200]   I don't know, the obstacle course
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:26.340]   or do some really scary hike.
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:29.140]   If you both have humor, now you go to a comedy show.
[02:58:29.140 --> 02:58:30.260]   If you both love learning,
[02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:31.460]   now you go to a museum or something.
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:34.580]   So you find the thing that's like your convergent strengths
[02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:36.540]   and you do something that exercises them.
[02:58:36.540 --> 02:58:38.420]   So that means you can use your strengths to get purpose,
[02:58:38.420 --> 02:58:40.760]   not just in your work, but in your leisure too.
[02:58:40.760 --> 02:58:43.000]   And I think this is another spot where we get stuff wrong.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:44.640]   I think a lot of us have work
[02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:46.260]   that tends to use our strengths.
[02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:47.760]   We tend to gravitate towards careers.
[02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:49.340]   Many of us where we can use our strengths,
[02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:51.220]   a lot of folks aren't that lucky.
[02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:53.020]   But in our leisure time,
[02:58:53.020 --> 02:58:54.960]   we don't often do that so much, right?
[02:58:54.960 --> 02:58:57.260]   Often our leisure time is like plop down,
[02:58:57.260 --> 02:58:59.040]   you know, watch Netflix for a lot of folks.
[02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:01.460]   Like if you think about how you can build your strengths
[02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:03.620]   into your leisure time, it gets even more exciting.
[02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:05.340]   So, you know, you're talking about working with your hands
[02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:07.020]   and doing all this stuff like, you know,
[02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:09.380]   build the bravery and the humor into that somehow.
[02:59:09.380 --> 02:59:11.600]   Now you get your leisure time doing double duty
[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:13.860]   for giving you a sense of purpose and meaning too.
[02:59:13.860 --> 02:59:15.060]   - I love doing stuff with my hands
[02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:16.100]   and I also love doing things
[02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:18.220]   that are useful to other people.
[02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:20.100]   And years ago, I used to go set up fish tanks
[02:59:20.100 --> 02:59:21.300]   for people at their homes.
[02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:22.540]   And I don't know why,
[02:59:22.540 --> 02:59:24.260]   but I just kept setting up all these fish tanks
[02:59:24.260 --> 02:59:25.860]   for all these people and I delighted in it.
[02:59:25.860 --> 02:59:30.020]   And it makes me realize that I think for everybody,
[02:59:30.020 --> 02:59:31.300]   certainly not just me,
[02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:35.460]   that we get tremendous pleasure from being useful to others
[02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:39.100]   in ways that really resonate with kind of who we feel we are
[02:59:39.100 --> 02:59:40.420]   and that these strengths,
[02:59:40.420 --> 02:59:42.900]   I think that's kind of the ultimate situation really.
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:44.540]   And if we're getting paid for it also great,
[02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:46.940]   but you're saying work it into
[02:59:46.940 --> 02:59:48.620]   your recreational time as well.
[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:50.300]   - Yeah, and I'm glad you brought up this idea
[02:59:50.300 --> 02:59:52.480]   of doing for others because we haven't talked about that,
[02:59:52.480 --> 02:59:54.100]   but this is another behavioral hack
[02:59:54.100 --> 02:59:55.780]   that's huge for happiness.
[02:59:55.780 --> 02:59:58.340]   And I think one that we get wrong as a culture in the US,
[02:59:58.340 --> 02:59:59.220]   but kind of broadly,
[02:59:59.220 --> 03:00:02.380]   there's all this talk about self-care or treat yourself.
[03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:04.660]   If you look at any kind of article about happiness,
[03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:05.820]   maybe not so evidence-based,
[03:00:05.820 --> 03:00:07.420]   talk about self, self, self, self.
[03:00:07.420 --> 03:00:08.460]   If you look at happy people though,
[03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:11.100]   happy people don't spend a lot of time on themselves.
[03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:12.660]   They tend to be very other oriented.
[03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:14.140]   So controlled for income,
[03:00:14.140 --> 03:00:16.100]   happier people donate more money to charity
[03:00:16.100 --> 03:00:17.820]   than not so happy people.
[03:00:17.820 --> 03:00:20.060]   Controlled for the amount of free time people have,
[03:00:20.060 --> 03:00:22.460]   happy people tend to volunteer for others.
[03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:24.860]   Broadly construed, whether it's helping formally
[03:00:24.860 --> 03:00:26.420]   or kind of donating time,
[03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:29.780]   they tend to help more than not so happy people.
[03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:32.180]   That again, correlation, it could be happy.
[03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:34.060]   Doing nice stuff for others helps you become happy.
[03:00:34.060 --> 03:00:34.880]   It could be that if you're happy,
[03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:35.720]   you do nice stuff for others.
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:36.860]   And for sure that link is true.
[03:00:36.860 --> 03:00:39.980]   There is this thing called the feel good, do good effect.
[03:00:39.980 --> 03:00:41.760]   But lots of experiments have sort of forced people
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:43.000]   to do nice stuff for others
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.080]   and found that it winds up making them happier.
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:47.660]   One study by Lara Ackman and colleagues did this study
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:49.300]   where they walk up to people on the street
[03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:50.220]   and hand them 20 bucks.
[03:00:50.220 --> 03:00:51.220]   It's an awesome study to be in
[03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:52.780]   if you're some undergrad walking around campus like,
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:54.140]   "Oh, cool, 20 bucks."
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:56.220]   But then you'll be told how to spend it.
[03:00:56.220 --> 03:00:58.260]   You either have to spend the 20 bucks to treat yourself,
[03:00:58.260 --> 03:00:59.360]   do something nice for yourself,
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.300]   or spend the 20 bucks on someone else,
[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:03.180]   do something nice for other people.
[03:01:03.180 --> 03:01:04.620]   And people at the end of the day,
[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:06.140]   even kind of at later timescales,
[03:01:06.140 --> 03:01:08.260]   report being happier when they spend
[03:01:08.260 --> 03:01:09.680]   the exact same amount of money
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:11.700]   on someone else versus themselves.
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:13.140]   And I think this has a big message
[03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:14.900]   'cause sometimes, I don't know if you're in a,
[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:16.020]   I don't know if you, like you,
[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:16.860]   but if you're having a bad day,
[03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:18.100]   it's like, "I'm gonna treat myself for something.
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:20.460]   "I might buy something or spend some money on myself,
[03:01:20.460 --> 03:01:22.660]   "buy myself a kind of cool experience."
[03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:25.580]   But if you gifted that experience to your brother
[03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:27.580]   or your good friend, your co-worker, your spouse,
[03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:29.140]   it might actually make you happier
[03:01:29.140 --> 03:01:30.640]   than having that experience yourself,
[03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:32.060]   which is really counterintuitive,
[03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:33.980]   but it's what the data show.
[03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:35.260]   - I've discovered this in recent years.
[03:01:35.260 --> 03:01:36.940]   I love, love, love giving gifts.
[03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:39.940]   It just, it's the best feeling.
[03:01:39.940 --> 03:01:41.420]   - Yeah. - It's the best feeling.
[03:01:41.420 --> 03:01:43.380]   - Here's another hack you can do to help,
[03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:47.540]   to kind of help others, oddly, is to ask for help,
[03:01:47.540 --> 03:01:50.700]   which is something we forget is quite powerful.
[03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:52.820]   Think about the last time somebody asked you for advice,
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:54.320]   advice that you could give.
[03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:55.420]   Probably felt pretty good.
[03:01:55.420 --> 03:01:58.220]   Probably made you feel a little competent or whatever.
[03:01:58.220 --> 03:01:59.580]   Probably liked helping that person.
[03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:01.780]   You get the happiness boost from helping that person.
[03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:04.160]   We forget that asking other people for help,
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:06.740]   especially when we know they can kind of do it,
[03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:09.060]   can be a way to sort of give them a little bit gift
[03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:10.880]   and make them happy.
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:12.300]   This is one that can be hard for me
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:14.780]   'cause I like to think about my competence all the time.
[03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:15.940]   I don't wanna be a burden on people.
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:17.020]   I don't wanna be vulnerable. - Self-sufficient.
[03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:18.640]   - Yes. - Self-sufficient.
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:19.480]   - But it turns out,
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:21.300]   especially if you're a particularly self-sufficient person,
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:23.900]   when you ask people for help, it can be really useful.
[03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:26.460]   So that's another one,
[03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:28.260]   'cause I know some folks listening right now
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:30.380]   might not have the financial means to be donating money
[03:02:30.380 --> 03:02:32.580]   or the time, affluence, and wherewithal
[03:02:32.580 --> 03:02:33.860]   to be doing gifts and these things,
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:36.500]   but remember that asking for help
[03:02:36.500 --> 03:02:37.800]   can be a gift to someone else,
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:40.380]   and it's a little social connection too.
[03:02:40.380 --> 03:02:41.260]   - That's awesome.
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:43.780]   I will also say your suggestion
[03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:48.160]   that people fill out the Signature Strengths site
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:50.120]   and then use that as a first date incentive.
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:51.020]   I look forward to the day
[03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:52.540]   when a comment comes through on YouTube
[03:02:52.540 --> 03:02:55.440]   that people were married as a consequence of a first date.
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:56.820]   - Yeah, Tinder's going out of business
[03:02:56.820 --> 03:02:59.640]   if we start doing these strength dates like that, so yeah.
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:00.480]   - Every once in a while,
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:02.380]   someone will contact me and say
[03:03:02.380 --> 03:03:05.500]   that they watched the fertility episode
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:07.780]   and did a male and female fertility episode,
[03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:12.780]   and that they now have a child on the way.
[03:03:12.780 --> 03:03:15.860]   I don't ask questions about when the child was conceived
[03:03:15.860 --> 03:03:18.580]   or what the relationship to the fertility episode was.
[03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:19.820]   I'm assuming it was the information
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:21.140]   in the fertility episode,
[03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:24.300]   but I always, I'm like, "Whoa, that's wild."
[03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:26.340]   So I bet you that at some point in the future,
[03:03:26.340 --> 03:03:29.260]   I'm creating a little bit of a time capsule here.
[03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:30.620]   You'll get contacted or something
[03:03:30.620 --> 03:03:32.900]   will legitimately fall into the comments
[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:34.940]   about people deciding to spend their life together
[03:03:34.940 --> 03:03:37.000]   as a consequence of having done the Signature Strength
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.680]   first date, you heard it here first, Dr. Laurie Santos.
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:46.860]   And in all seriousness, Laurie, Dr. Santos,
[03:03:46.860 --> 03:03:50.060]   I just wanna say thank you so much for doing the work you do.
[03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:51.740]   It's awesome, awesome work.
[03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:54.900]   I mean, what's more important than our emotional state
[03:03:54.900 --> 03:03:59.060]   and to strive to be happy, but to understand happiness
[03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:00.420]   so that we're not pursuing something
[03:04:00.420 --> 03:04:02.780]   that either doesn't exist
[03:04:02.780 --> 03:04:07.740]   or that is an illusion that's been created for us.
[03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:10.700]   Like really, I think one of the amazing things
[03:04:10.700 --> 03:04:14.180]   about what you do is you realistically frame happiness
[03:04:14.180 --> 03:04:16.620]   as attainable, but you frame it in the science
[03:04:16.620 --> 03:04:20.380]   of how to actually get it and what it means.
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:23.220]   And as people could probably detect,
[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:25.380]   I love, love, love that you've studied this thing
[03:04:25.380 --> 03:04:28.460]   that we call happiness and other aspects of emotion
[03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:30.740]   and social cognition in the context of not just humans,
[03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:35.660]   but our non-human friends, cats and dogs.
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:38.500]   And use that knowledge, like building up
[03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:41.060]   from basic understanding of how neural circuits
[03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:42.400]   and psychology work to a place
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:44.620]   that humans can really act on.
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:46.140]   And you've given us a tremendous number
[03:04:46.140 --> 03:04:47.300]   of actionable tools today.
[03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:49.260]   I mean, too many to list off here all at once.
[03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:51.580]   We'll put them in the timestamps as tools
[03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:54.060]   so that people can get right to them and review them.
[03:04:54.060 --> 03:04:56.060]   But the social connection piece, obviously,
[03:04:56.060 --> 03:04:58.220]   the understanding of the contrast with difficult things
[03:04:58.220 --> 03:05:01.780]   to arrive at better states and different timescales
[03:05:01.780 --> 03:05:04.380]   and doing for others and just so much.
[03:05:04.380 --> 03:05:06.160]   There's too much here for me to list off
[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:09.140]   without adding another 30 minutes to this podcast.
[03:05:09.140 --> 03:05:11.740]   And no one wants to hear me speak anymore.
[03:05:11.740 --> 03:05:13.980]   So I'm just gonna say thank you for the research
[03:05:13.980 --> 03:05:16.740]   that you have done and continue to do.
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:18.020]   Thank you for doing your podcast.
[03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:19.660]   I'm gonna start listening to your podcast.
[03:05:19.660 --> 03:05:21.940]   I love these issues and I think they're super,
[03:05:21.940 --> 03:05:25.580]   super timely and important for everybody.
[03:05:25.580 --> 03:05:27.540]   And thanks for taking time out of your schedule
[03:05:27.540 --> 03:05:29.860]   to come here and educate us today.
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:31.100]   - Thanks so much, it was a blast.
[03:05:31.100 --> 03:05:32.060]   - Let's do it again.
[03:05:32.060 --> 03:05:32.900]   - Definitely.
[03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:34.880]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:36.500]   with Dr. Lori Santos.

[03:06:10.100 --> 03:06:12.580]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:06:12.580 --> 03:06:14.440]   I do read all the comments.
[03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:16.860]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[03:06:16.860 --> 03:06:19.700]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:06:19.700 --> 03:06:22.580]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:24.740]   Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn.
[03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:26.100]   And on all those platforms,
[03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:28.280]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:29.740]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:06:29.740 --> 03:06:31.180]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:33.180]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:34.640]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:38.100]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:39.240]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:40.440]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:42.060]   It's my very first book.
[03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:43.460]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:06:43.460 --> 03:06:45.600]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:46.780]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:47.940]   for more than five years,
[03:06:47.940 --> 03:06:50.260]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:51.820]   of research and experience.
[03:06:51.820 --> 03:06:54.860]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[03:06:54.860 --> 03:06:57.360]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:06:57.360 --> 03:06:59.820]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:06:59.820 --> 03:07:03.180]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:07:03.180 --> 03:07:05.260]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:07:05.260 --> 03:07:09.160]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:11.540]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:07:11.540 --> 03:07:13.300]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:07:13.300 --> 03:07:15.060]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:07:15.060 --> 03:07:17.580]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:07:17.580 --> 03:07:19.060]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:07:19.060 --> 03:07:20.860]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:07:20.860 --> 03:07:22.060]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[03:07:22.060 --> 03:07:24.020]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:26.220]   that includes everything from podcast summaries
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:27.380]   to what we call protocols
[03:07:27.380 --> 03:07:30.060]   in the form of brief one to three page PDFs
[03:07:30.060 --> 03:07:32.780]   that cover things like how to optimize your sleep,
[03:07:32.780 --> 03:07:34.420]   how to regulate your dopamine.
[03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:37.540]   We also have protocols related to deliberate cold exposure,
[03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:39.360]   get a lot of questions about that,
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:41.340]   deliberate heat exposure, and on and on.
[03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:43.460]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[03:07:43.460 --> 03:07:45.380]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:07:45.380 --> 03:07:47.500]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:07:47.500 --> 03:07:49.580]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[03:07:49.580 --> 03:07:52.300]   And I should mention that we do not share your email
[03:07:52.300 --> 03:07:53.260]   with anybody.
[03:07:53.260 --> 03:07:54.540]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:07:54.540 --> 03:07:57.060]   for today's discussion with Dr. Laurie Santos.
[03:07:57.060 --> 03:07:59.220]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:07:59.220 --> 03:08:01.280]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:08:01.280 --> 03:08:03.860]   (upbeat music)
