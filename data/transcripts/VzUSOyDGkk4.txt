[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.940]   All right, we're making good progress here.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.940]   Uh, we've got a quick one here.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.220]   This one comes from Ryan.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.000]   Ryan asks, Cal, how did you never get tempted to join any social media platform?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   You know, I get asked that a lot.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.780]   I don't completely remember is the honest answer.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.520]   What I can piece together is 2004.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.500]   I was a senior at Dartmouth.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.680]   Facebook at the time was marching from campus to campus, right?
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.120]   They had a strategy back then of opening it up to specific universities at a time.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.360]   And it arrived at Dartmouth in 2004.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   I went back and confirmed this, uh, with various people who were there.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.000]   I do remember there was a lot of excitement around it.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   It might've even been called the Facebook back then.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.440]   And my vague memory is the two things that turned me off about it was number one,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.920]   back then your Facebook profile was all about favorite list,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.080]   favorite books, favorite songs.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   Like you had to basically carefully curate these lists of things that
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.520]   your favorites, and it didn't matter if they were favorites or not.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.160]   This was all about Irving Goffman's presentation of self to others.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.080]   You were trying to very carefully craft your public persona by selecting,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.360]   you know, a quirky mix of a little bit indie, but then you throw in like a
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.520]   big genre book, the show that you're of the people, but then you put in a
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.680]   portrait of the artist as a young man, the show you're sophisticated.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.560]   It was, it just seemed very artificial.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.960]   And I hate doing lists.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.200]   Everyone who knows me knows this.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   If you say, what's your favorite book, what's your favorite movie?
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.640]   I can't do it.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.720]   I literally can't do it.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.520]   I don't know why.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.920]   Uh, the ordering function of my brain is broken.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.840]   So I, I didn't, I really didn't like this idea of having to come up with these lists.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.480]   It felt artificial and I'm really bad at it.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.040]   It really does make me feel upset.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   So I was like, yeah, I'm not going to join.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.400]   The second reason I vaguely remember, this is such a long time ago, but I'm
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000]   a contemporary of Zuckerberg, we're both computer science students, both
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.960]   at Ivy, Ivy league universities.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.400]   I had had a.com startup that I closed down a couple of years
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.880]   before Facebook got started.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   And so there was probably some inter Ivy jealousy there.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.800]   Like, okay, why is this fellow nerd?
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   Who's very similar to me.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.520]   You know, why is everyone excited about his company?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.600]   And so there's probably a little bit of jealousy of like, I don't
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   want to pump up this guy's ego.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.840]   And you know, that worked and that worked.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.480]   And no one ever thought about him again.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.200]   But no, so I don't know.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.400]   Those are the two things I remember.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.160]   And then once I had some separation from social media, I begin to observe.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.440]   Wait a second.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.280]   People have kind of a weird relationship to this.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080]   So I had that Margaret Mead anthropological separation from
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.400]   what was going on around me.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160]   And I was like, this seems a little bit weird.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   The more I watched this from the outside, the more it seems like I'm looking
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.440]   at a weird tribal ritual here.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.240]   And I got more and more turned off about it.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.720]   Like, I really don't know about this.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.800]   And over time, my distaste for it kind of grew.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.920]   The skepticism grew.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.880]   And then, and again, I always say this.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.360]   I got very public about my skepticism about it.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   And everyone said I was crazy until about 2016.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.520]   And then suddenly everyone was on board.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.560]   So that was, it's, that was a weird experience in itself, but
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.800]   that's my vague memory, Ryan.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.160]   I don't know.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.720]   There might've been other factors involved.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.240]   Uh, but that's it.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.040]   That's what I remember.
