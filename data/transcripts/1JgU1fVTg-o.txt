[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Pastor John, another common question that we get in the inbox is how the Holy Spirit works in our lives and how our lives are
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.040]   influenced by the Holy Spirit in our relationship to Him,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.560]   which raises all sorts of questions in the practices of what we should do and not do in that relationship.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.120]   Mick from Arizona writes in to ask this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.680]   I was recently struck after reading 1 Thessalonians 5.19, which instructs us not to quench the Spirit.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.920]   What does this phrase mean, 'do not quench the Spirit,' and what are some ways that we might do this in our daily lives?"
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.680]   Let's get the specific text in front of us
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.460]   and a little bit of context. So here's 1 Thessalonians 5.16-22.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.360]   Rejoice always,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360]   pray without ceasing,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.800]   give thanks in all circumstances,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.000]   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit, do not despise prophecy,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   but test everything,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.160]   hold fast to what is good, abstain from every form of evil. Now, let's get one thing really clear at the outset,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.160]   namely that being able to quench the Spirit of God does not mean
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.380]   that we are sovereign and He's not. It does not mean that we have
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.120]   final or decisive control over the omnipotent Spirit of God.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.000]   It means that God, for wise and holy and good reasons,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.760]   often allows us to resist the Holy Spirit, allows us, permits us, or as the old word suffers us,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.240]   to resist the Holy Spirit. It's plain that God can overrule our
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.000]   resistance and quenching and
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.280]   bring us to repentance whenever He pleases. And I get that from 2 Timothy 2.25,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.160]   where it says, "God may perhaps grant them repentance,"
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.960]   leading to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.240]   Repentance from resisting the Spirit of God is a gift of God.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.160]   So, let's keep out of our minds any thought here that our ability to quench the Spirit means we have decisive control over the
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.520]   Spirit in our lives. We don't. He is sovereign and lets us, for His
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.080]   purposes, sometimes
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.800]   quench Him. Now, what does it mean?
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   What do we do when we quench the Spirit? And here are four quick answers. Number one, it means to despise
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.760]   the supernatural work of the Spirit and treat it with contempt. Right there in the context,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.960]   do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.400]   prophecies, but test everything, hold fast to what is good.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Evidently, some in the church at Thessalonica
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.560]   despised the gift of prophecy. Now, why would they do that? Well, evidently, the gift was being misused in some way.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.880]   I've seen it done. I've been tempted to despise it myself.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.760]   It's so often the case. But Paul's response to that, which is very realistic, he says,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.480]   "Yes, that happens. So, test everything,
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.840]   hold fast to what is good. Throw away the chaff, keep the good. So, don't despise
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.480]   God's gift. That would be the first way that we quench the Spirit, having an attitude of contempt
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.000]   towards God's
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.200]   supernatural
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.640]   gifting. Number two, quenching the Spirit means neglecting the gift we have. Here's where I get that.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.000]   1 Timothy 4.14, 2 Timothy 1.6. Compare these two.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.560]   Do not neglect, Timothy, do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.160]   when the council of elders laid their hands on you. And then 2 Timothy 1.6. I
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.240]   remind you, fan into flame
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.720]   the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. So, in Paul's mind,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.320]   neglecting the gift was virtually the opposite of fanning it into flame or
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.720]   quenching it. He could have said, Timothy, don't quench the Spirit. Stir up his
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.960]   gifts into flame. So, if you have a gift from God,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.480]   you are quenching the Spirit if you don't fan it into flame.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.560]   That's number two. Number three, quenching the Spirit means
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.680]   shutting down your emotions
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.080]   when joyful
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.560]   spiritual expressions are called for. I get that from Ephesians 5.18. Do not get drunk with wine,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.440]   which is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.640]   Addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing, making melody to the Lord in your heart.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.720]   So, the vibrant fullness of the Spirit overflows in
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.960]   appropriate expressions like singing and making melody from the heart to the Lord.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.040]   And if you don't like those expressions and you resist them, fold your arms. I'm not gonna do that sort of thing.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.480]   I'm not gonna sing. You are quenching the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.560]   Number four, finally, quenching the Spirit means
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:30.600]   resisting the fruit of the Holy Spirit, the gracious behaviors that come from the Spirit. I get that from Ephesians 4.30,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.560]   where it talks about grieving the Spirit. And I think grieving the Spirit and quenching the Spirit are very close to each other.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.960]   Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth, but only what is good for up-building,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.080]   as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. Do not
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.120]   grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.040]   Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.840]   So, in front of the command not to grieve the Spirit, behind the command not to grieve the Spirit,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.960]   we have these exhortations to be kind and gracious to other people. In other words, live out the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.160]   So, my answer to Mick's question
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.400]   about this quenching of the Spirit is, first,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.240]   that when we quench Him, we're not sovereign. He is sovereign. And then it means four things.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.800]   Despising some gift of the Holy Spirit. Number two,
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   neglecting some gift that we have. Number three, shutting down our emotions and refusing to give expression to them. And
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.680]   number four,
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.160]   resisting the fruit of the Spirit in our lives.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.080]   So good. Thank you, Pastor John. And
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.760]   may we be very careful not to neglect or despise some of the gifts that God has
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.640]   intended for us to enjoy in our lives and in our churches. This is such a great word for us today.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.280]   Thank you, Pastor John. And next time we hear from a woman who now finds herself stuck in a moment of indecision.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   So, what are we to do as Christians when our hesitancy
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.480]   freezes us? That's the question Pastor John will address on Wednesday.
