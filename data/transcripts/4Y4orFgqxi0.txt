[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   - Hi, this is Gary Kim at ShepCon.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.640]   I'm here with Caleb.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.400]   Caleb, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Yeah, my name is Caleb Cunningham.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.920]   I'm a pastoral associate here at Grace Community Church.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.960]   I have different roles in children's,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.680]   Grace Equip, our school, Grace Academy,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.760]   campus pastor for that.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.800]   Yeah, I do many different things
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   here at Grace Community Church.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.280]   - Okay, and Caleb, you've been reading
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.520]   from the LSB for a bit.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.360]   What do you think?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.000]   - Yeah, I love the LSB for many reasons.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.280]   Number one reason, it's from a trusted team of translators.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.240]   It's all men that I know personally.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   I know their theology.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.760]   I know their convictions on the word of God.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.720]   It's men that I trust.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.440]   I also love how they're very consistent
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.720]   in the words that they use.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.240]   A lot of words are repeated,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.000]   that you usually don't see in other languages.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.160]   And it helps just to show that repeated word,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.840]   it gives it emphasis.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.800]   The LSB's really good.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.160]   It's trusted, trusted resource,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.480]   and I highly recommend it for you and your church.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.320]   - All right, great.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.480]   Thanks Kayla for dropping by.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.640]   - Thank you, thank you.
