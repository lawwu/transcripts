[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Earlier, you mentioned attentional spotlights
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.900]   and I'm fascinated by this.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I know that most people hear that we can't multitask,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280]   but primates again, of which we are old world primates
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.600]   in particular can do covert attention.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   If I were not completely focused on you,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.280]   I could focus an attentional spotlight on you
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.700]   and your voice and pay attention to you,
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.900]   but I could also monitor components of the room.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.740]   - Yeah.
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.560]   - I can merge those spotlights.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.120]   I can divorce those spotlights.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   - That's right.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680]   - But it's very hard to generate three
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.120]   kind of compatible attentional spotlights at once.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.880]   It seems like we kind of have two.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.720]   - Yeah.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.340]   - Maybe some people can manage three,
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.200]   but I'm betting most people can't manage more than three.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.960]   - Well, I think it becomes especially difficult
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.680]   to manage even one when you're experiencing
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.720]   an emotional episode that is essentially
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.080]   hijacking your attention.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.480]   And attention is really important to talk about
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.340]   for a few reasons.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.920]   So number one, as a species,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.120]   we have the most sophisticated attention deployment system
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.480]   on the planet, right?
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.320]   We have the ability to strategically deploy our attention.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.980]   So we can willfully place it on the things we want
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.160]   or yank it away from the things we don't want,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.480]   or we can go, we can saccade our attention back and forth.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.200]   When it comes to emotion though,
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.520]   we are often taught certain maxims
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.800]   about how to deploy our attention.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.240]   But I think can sometimes be problematic
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   because they fall into the category of prescriptive advice
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.120]   about magic pills.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.720]   So often we hear, for example,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.140]   that when it comes to chatter or really big emotions,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.760]   things that you're anxious about or fearful,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.040]   you should not avoid the problem.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.420]   You should focus on it.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.920]   And there's been a lot of research on this.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.420]   And what we have learned is on the one hand,
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.800]   chronically avoiding things is not good.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.920]   It's associated with all sorts of negative outcomes
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   for our emotional lives
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.440]   and beyond our physical lives too, our health.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   But oftentimes the signature for adaptively coping
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.700]   with emotional curve balls
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.160]   is being able to focus on the problem at hand,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.880]   deploy your attention elsewhere, take a break,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.720]   and then come back to it.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.760]   And so this was a question actually I learned
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   from my grandmother inadvertently.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.120]   My grandmother was this very interesting woman
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   who grew up in Poland during World War II,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.100]   had her entire family slaughtered during the war.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.560]   One of these kind of devastating experiences,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.540]   lived in the forest for years, back and forth,
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.240]   all this terrible stuff, family massacred and so forth.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   And growing up, she made it out of the war,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.480]   moved to the States.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.960]   I remember being just so exceptionally curious
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.800]   about what she experienced
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.960]   and how she was able to overcome it.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.720]   And whenever I would ask her questions about this,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   she would always say, don't ask me why or what happened,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.080]   why is a crooked letter?
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.400]   That was a phrase she would use,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.320]   which was really interesting
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.920]   'cause she didn't speak English very well at all,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.360]   heavily accented language,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.720]   but she'd mastered this curious idiom,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.120]   like why is a crooked letter?
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.560]   In other words, nothing good comes from dredging up
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.360]   the past or really trying to understand things.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.000]   Your life is awesome, you're in a safe place,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.920]   you have a loving family, just enjoy life.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.780]   So she's trying to shelter me.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.680]   So she, for most of the time that I would know her
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.960]   during the year, she would never focus
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.000]   on this horrific event that she experienced,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.840]   except one day a year,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   there would be this remembrance day
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.940]   and we'd all pile into a synagogue and we'd talk about,
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.640]   or I would listen to them talk about their experiences
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.600]   and the emotions would come out.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   So she would dose her exposure to the emotional information.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.400]   Turns out what she was doing is she was being strategic
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.060]   in how she deployed her attention.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.080]   She was focusing on the emotional issue at times
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.420]   when it was productive for her,
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.360]   but at other times when it didn't serve her well,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.880]   she occupied her attention
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.520]   with other kinds of thoughts and experiences.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.840]   And a large literature is now beginning to emerge,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.840]   which shows that this capacity to be flexible
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.360]   in how we wield our attention
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.480]   when it comes to sources of emotional struggles
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.880]   can be a really, really useful asset.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.760]   And so I think it's important to remind folks
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.680]   that these blunt prescriptions
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.360]   to like always approach a thing, a problem,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.160]   or always avoid it, they aren't always true.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.480]   And that often the magic that surrounds emotion regulation,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.520]   I mean, the magic, not supernaturally,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.160]   but the beauty surrounding it is in being really facile
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   in how we can deploy our attention.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.060]   - Really appreciate you sharing that personal anecdote.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.760]   I've long struggled with the fact
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.300]   that so many of the sayings that were fed,
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.520]   like, you know, absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.360]   Well, yeah.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.840]   Well, I also heard out of sight, out of mind.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.680]   So which one is it?
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.520]   - That's right.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.560]   - You know, and that's why eventually I became a scientist.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.480]   - That's right.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.400]   - Because, you know, it's both, right?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.580]   And, you know, and you can see this
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.880]   in the fields of nutrition and exercise.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.800]   I mean, there are certain core truths.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   And I think the goal is always to get to those core truths.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.160]   And then there's some flexibility around those truths.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.360]   There's margins of error.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.240]   I love what she shared, you know, why is a crooked letter.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.140]   It reminds me of the Bob Dylan, like, don't look back.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah, I mean, these are profound questions, right?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.280]   Like how much of our consciousness should we use
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.840]   to enforce that we don't spend time thinking about the past
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.460]   and therefore miss out on the present
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.420]   and creating a best possible future.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.480]   And yet we don't want elements from the past
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.040]   to kind of, you know, ferret into our psyche
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.760]   and then show up in ways that are destructive.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.420]   So it's a complicated dance.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.060]   - Oh, I mean, our emotional lives
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.840]   are anything but straightforward,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.320]   but we do have guideposts to steer us
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.360]   in how we deploy our attention.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.720]   And so a couple of common heuristics
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.560]   that I like to use and describe to folks is,
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.280]   so let's say something bad happens
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.320]   and you divert your attention away.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.400]   You distract with a positive distraction,
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.040]   not a harmful distraction.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.160]   And then the problem doesn't resurface, keep going.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   Like you don't have to go back in time.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.080]   There's actually, I experienced some friction
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.560]   sometimes with my dad around this issue.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   So my parents were divorced and, you know,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.520]   I dealt with the baggage surrounding that experience
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.640]   earlier in my life.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.360]   And when I think about it now, I don't get upset.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.460]   Like I understand why it happened.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.400]   I love both of my parents.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.560]   I've moved on, I'm well-adjusted.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.320]   But my dad likes to talk about this a lot whenever we speak.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.520]   And he, you know, will often bring it up.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.880]   And when he does, I'm like,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.520]   well, we don't have to talk about it.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.080]   I'm actually totally fine.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.960]   This isn't a source of ongoing distress.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.040]   Sometimes we're able to make sense of what has happened to us
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   and move on with our lives.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.440]   And when that happens, you know,
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   that's our cognitive machinery operating really, really well.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.960]   We don't have to go back and revisit every single thing.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.640]   If on the other hand, we are trying to get a mental break,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.760]   we're distracting and we find thoughts
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.800]   about these experiences continually intruding
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.200]   into our awareness and being distracting.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.400]   That is then a cue, okay, well, let's focus in on it.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.000]   And then once you focus in on it,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.680]   of course there are multiple ways
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.040]   you can engage with that experience.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   Sometimes just bathing yourself in the emotional pain
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.480]   can be useful for facilitating a kind of
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.120]   what we would call habituation.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.040]   So getting used to the discomfort
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.080]   and realizing it's not so bad
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.620]   to be in the presence of those negative thoughts.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.840]   Maybe you wanna reframe
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.480]   how you think about the circumstance.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.120]   And we have wonderful cognitive apparatus
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.480]   to help us reframe things.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.120]   We can look at it from different perspectives.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.180]   We can focus on the silver lining.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.860]   We can contextualize it.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.200]   So you have lots of tools to engage with things
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.960]   once you refocus,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.920]   but you don't always need to refocus on the problem.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.000]   So you wanna be flexible.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.460]   Flexibility and how you deploy your attention
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.380]   is really the mantra that I personally live by
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.180]   based on what I know of how all of this works.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.360]   There are a couple of caveats.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.600]   I wanna throw out there.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.320]   When I'm talking about distraction and avoiding,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.840]   I'm talking about healthy distractions, healthy avoidance.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.780]   There are unhealthier forms of avoidance
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.900]   that we know definitively are not productive,
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.240]   like substance abuse.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.160]   We also know that if you adopt a blunt rule
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.120]   of always just chronically avoiding, not good.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.440]   So you wanna be balanced.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.640]   - Could we add to the list of tools for avoidance
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.740]   that tend to be unhealthy?
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.580]   And this isn't one that I default to,
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.180]   but I know someone that told me
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.180]   that she used to default into over-consumption of story,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.820]   like of audio books, not that audio books are bad,
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.380]   but of fiction audio books,
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.220]   and just kind of when there was a problem
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.260]   rather than dealing with the problem,
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.020]   overindulgence in narratives
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.500]   that would just kind of consume the mind.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.660]   I guess any behavior where we're not dealing
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.980]   with the kind of itch that we probably need to scratch,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.540]   at least for a short while,
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.900]   is probably gonna be maladaptive in the long run.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.980]   - Yeah, I mean, if the problem keeps,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.580]   like you wanna listen to what your mind and body
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.580]   are telling you.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.060]   And so if you find that the problem keeps resurfacing,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.200]   that's a cue you need to engage and deal with it.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.540]   But a lot of the experiences we have on a daily basis,
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.220]   which may not be positive, negative experiences,
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.140]   as time moves on,
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.220]   sometimes that's all we need to keep going with our lives.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.420]   And we do see in the literature
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   that when you impose a particular view on folks,
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.020]   like you have to do it this way,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.180]   that tends not to work out very well.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.100]   (upbeat music)
