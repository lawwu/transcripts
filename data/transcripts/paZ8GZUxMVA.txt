[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   When did you realize we had, you know, something special with Nicola?
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.580]   Did you did you know that early on?
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   I know Nerkich was here at the time.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.880]   Yeah. Yeah, that was it's a it's a funny story about about Nicola.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.760]   And if anybody tells you they knew they are lying through their teeth.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.860]   I didn't know. The first year I got drafted, I went to training camp
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.460]   and I had no idea.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.720]   Like, so I'm seeing Mason Plumlee and Nicola go at it.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.160]   I'm like, wait, why does Nicola start over Mason?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.860]   Like, I remember that was my thought process.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.340]   So, yeah. Yeah. Tell me that story.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.400]   How did you? So, yeah, Yoke Yoke is a is a funny story.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.340]   I remember sitting with our former president of basketball ops and GM
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.840]   at the time, time.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.480]   They're like, hey, there's this guy that you should you should see on tape
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.140]   because we want to we want him to keep his name in the draft.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.520]   And he but he wants to stay over in Europe for one more year.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.380]   I remember them showing me on tape and Nicola's wearing like this.
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.980]   Their colors were like pink and blue.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.460]   And and Nicola couldn't jump over a phone book, but he catch these balls
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.520]   and he'd throw these passes that you're like,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.940]   I don't know how that's going to translate, but that...
