[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.500]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.540]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.580]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.340]   Today, we are discussing how to build tenacity and willpower.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.380]   Previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.500]   have focused on the topic of motivation.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.460]   And while motivation and willpower
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.380]   are linked thematically and mechanistically,
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.420]   today we are going to discuss tenacity,
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.420]   that is the willingness to persist under pressure
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.800]   and resistance of different kinds, and willpower,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.740]   which has to do with both the motivation to do things
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.700]   and the motivation to resist certain things.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.280]   Today, you will learn about the psychology and neuroscience
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.060]   of tenacity and willpower.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.680]   And I must tell you, this is a fascinating literature.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.020]   In fact, you will learn about a brain structure
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.320]   that at least to my knowledge,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.100]   most neuroscientists are not even aware of.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.640]   And yet in researching this episode,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.660]   I absolutely fell in love with this brain structure
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.360]   because of its incredible ability to integrate
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.140]   the very sorts of information from within
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.640]   and from outside of you
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240]   to harness and build tenacity and willpower.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.300]   And indeed, today you will learn research-supported tools
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.820]   for how to enhance your level of tenacity and willpower
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.540]   in any circumstance.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.180]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.280]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.820]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.520]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.940]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.180]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.100]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.840]   I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.340]   and with guests about the need to get
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.220]   approximately one gram of high quality protein
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.180]   per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.420]   There are many different ways that one can do that,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.080]   but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.380]   by ingesting excessive calories.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.580]   Maui Nui Venison has the highest density
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.740]   of quality protein per calorie,
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.180]   and it achieves that in delicious things
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.580]   like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.460]   I particularly like the ground venison.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.740]   I make those into venison burgers
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.900]   probably five times a week or more.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.300]   I also like the jerky for its convenience,
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.620]   especially when I'm traveling or I'm especially busy
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.340]   with work and know that I'm getting
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.380]   an extremely nutrient-dense high quality source of protein.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.500]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.900]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.140]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.140]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.080]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.120]   that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.160]   Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.840]   When we are sleeping well and enough,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.860]   mental health, physical health, and performance
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.400]   all stand to be at their best.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.260]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.860]   is to make sure that your mattress
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.080]   is tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.160]   Helix Sleep has a brief two-minute quiz
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.700]   that if you go to their website,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.520]   you take that quiz and answer questions
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.160]   such as do you tend to sleep on your back,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.040]   your side of your stomach?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.400]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.600]   and that's fine.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.080]   At the end of that two-minute quiz,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.560]   they will match you to a mattress
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.520]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.120]   I sleep on the Dusk, a D-U-S-K mattress.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.040]   And when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.760]   about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.600]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.020]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.280]   take their two-minute sleep quiz
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.560]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.620]   And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.160]   and two free pillows.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.440]   Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.500]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.600]   Okay, let's talk about tenacity and willpower
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.920]   and how to enhance your level of tenacity and willpower.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.540]   I will also mention certain cases
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.120]   where having too much tenacity and willpower
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.040]   can be problematic for mental health and physical health.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.600]   But for most people, I believe that enhancing one's level
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360]   of tenacity and willpower would be advantageous.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.520]   Now you'll be relieved to know
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.880]   that while there are a near infinite number
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.040]   of different circumstances where one would need to draw
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.100]   on tenacity and willpower in order to succeed,
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.220]   there is one major mechanism within the brain,
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.440]   indeed one major mechanism,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.240]   by which tenacity and willpower are generated.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.280]   And it arrives through the activation
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.840]   of a particular brain center that is a hub,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.940]   that is, it lies at the interface
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.640]   of many other neural circuits
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.720]   and has input from all the critical neural circuits
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.000]   that one would need
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.920]   in order to generate tenacity and willpower.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.000]   Now we are going to return
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.480]   to that particular neural circuit a little bit later
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.200]   after we talk about the psychology of willpower,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.520]   because in talking about the psychology of willpower,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.980]   it will frame up as to why understanding
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.600]   this one particular brain center or hub of inputs
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.360]   and outputs from different neural structures
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.240]   in the brain and body will indeed allow you
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.360]   to get the most out of the tools
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.160]   that have been shown in scientific research
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.920]   to enhance your level of tenacity and willpower.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.900]   In other words, understanding the psychology
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.520]   of tenacity and willpower, while valuable,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.040]   if it's coupled with an understanding
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.120]   of the underlying neural mechanism,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.320]   and notice I used the singular, neural mechanism,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.540]   not mechanisms for generating tenacity and willpower,
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.220]   will allow you to use and to tailor the specific protocols
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.140]   for enhancing tenacity and willpower
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.200]   to your unique circumstances.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.000]   So this is yet another case
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.100]   where certainly life circumstances vary
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.360]   from one person to the next.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.500]   The need for tenacity and willpower varies tremendously.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.360]   For instance, some people may need more tenacity
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.800]   and willpower in order to engage in certain behaviors.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.320]   Others of us might need more tenacity and willpower
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.440]   in order to resist certain types of behaviors.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.500]   Today, you will learn about the brain center
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.020]   that governs all of that, and then you can frame it
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.540]   within the psychological understanding
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.020]   of tenacity and willpower so that you can get the most
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.860]   out of the protocols that we will discuss.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.780]   Let's start by talking about what tenacity
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.100]   and willpower clearly are, and separating tenacity
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.180]   and willpower from some other psychological constructs
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.480]   that they often get confused with,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.540]   because this will be important
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.260]   in understanding exactly what we are trying to build
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.860]   when we say we want to build tenacity and willpower.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.820]   So tenacity and willpower can be distinguished
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.780]   from habit execution.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.500]   Habit execution is what you do anytime you wake up
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.540]   in the morning, maybe you lie there for a bit,
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.040]   maybe you get out of bed immediately,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.100]   hopefully you get outside and get some sunlight in your eyes,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.840]   especially on cloudy days, go brush your teeth,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.860]   use the restroom, engage with others in your home
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.540]   if you live with others, et cetera.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.500]   All of those sorts of behaviors,
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.780]   while on some days can be a bit more challenging,
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.140]   especially the get out of bed part,
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.440]   maybe you didn't get a great night's sleep
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.180]   the night before, for instance,
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.500]   but all of those sorts of behaviors are behaviors
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.620]   that you have the neural circuits to generate,
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.920]   and that typically you can generate
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.740]   without a lot of willpower required.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.620]   Now willpower, sometimes also referred to as tenacity,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.340]   grit, or persistence, is a distinctly different phenomenon
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.560]   than habit execution, because willpower and tenacity require
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.720]   that we intervene in our own default neural processes,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.060]   such as habits or particular patterns of thinking,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.600]   and essentially govern ourselves to do or not do
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.500]   some particular thing, and that process requires effort,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   it requires energy, and I think all of us are familiar
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.700]   with that feeling of effort or energy
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.980]   that's required in order to engage in a behavior
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.980]   that we really don't feel like engaging in,
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.160]   or avoiding a behavior or a thought that by default,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.460]   we would naturally just engage in,
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.080]   and when I talk about energy in this context,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.780]   I'm mainly talking about neural energy.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.020]   Remember that neurons, nerve cells in your brain and body,
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.900]   use chemical and electrical signaling
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.180]   to communicate with one another,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.020]   that's what allows you and all of us
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.500]   to do all the things that we do,
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.860]   think, feel, move, et cetera.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.800]   Now, of course, that chemical and electrical communication
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.740]   requires fuel sources that indeed come from things
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.380]   like glucose, ketones, the creatine phosphate system,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.000]   multiple fuel systems feed the energetics of the brain,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.980]   but ultimately, when I talk about energy
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.280]   in today's discussion, I'm talking about the energy required
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.180]   to engage in or to resist in a particular behavior,
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.020]   and that level of energy can be quite high,
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.820]   depending on how much resistance we are feeling internally
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.800]   or externally, right, somebody can be telling us,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.500]   you're not going to be able to do this,
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   you can't do it, and you can say,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.140]   no, I have a ton of resolve, I have a ton of tenacity,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.780]   willpower, and I'm going to push past all the barriers
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.480]   that you are setting up for me on the outside.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.940]   Oftentimes, all too often, I should say,
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.680]   we experience resistance from the inside,
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.500]   where we are feeling like we don't want to do something,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.300]   or we really want to do something,
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.500]   and we are having trouble either engaging in the thing
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.120]   that we don't want to do, or that we know we should do,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.140]   but we just don't feel that level of motivation for,
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.400]   or we are having a hard time resisting the thing
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.160]   that's pulling us toward it.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.000]   So in that context, it's important for us
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.020]   not to just distinguish tenacity and willpower
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   from habit execution, but also draw out a continuum
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.220]   with tenacity and willpower at their most extreme
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.980]   on one end of that continuum, and apathy and, yes,
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.540]   depression on the other end of that continuum.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.360]   And we will return to the topic of depression
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.900]   a little bit later, but I can just cue it up right now
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.620]   by saying that one of the hallmark features
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.820]   of major depression is a lack of positive anticipation
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.240]   about the future that leads to, this is important,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.000]   there's a verb tense here, that leads to a much lower
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.760]   tendency to engage in the specific types of behavior
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.620]   that would allow one to arrive at a particular new,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.620]   different, and positive future.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.940]   So I'm deliberately putting apathy and depression
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.520]   next to one another at one end of the continuum,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.500]   and I'm putting grit, persistence, tenacity, and willpower
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.220]   at the other end of the continuum.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.240]   And a little bit later, it will become very clear to you
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.300]   why I put those particular items on the continuum
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.620]   as opposed to other psychological constructs
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.960]   such as motivation, because it turns out that motivation
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.220]   is what allows you to move up and down that continuum,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.420]   but motivation itself as a verb is distinct
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.060]   from what we call tenacity and willpower,
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.420]   and motivation itself is distinct
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.260]   from what we call apathy and depression.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.580]   But motivation is the engine or the motor, the verb,
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.100]   that allows you to move up and down that continuum.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.100]   And today you will learn multiple tools
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.620]   that will allow you to move toward the tenacity
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.460]   and willpower end of that continuum
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.460]   by engaging a very specific neural circuit.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.180]   Before we get into the discussion of neural circuits,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.460]   I'd like to talk about the psychology of willpower.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.540]   And this is something that really has been considered
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.620]   by psychologists for well over a hundred years.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.180]   William James wrote about this,
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.340]   the ancient Greeks wrote about this.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.260]   The topic of willpower is certainly not a new one.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.340]   And yet the formal study of willpower
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.720]   in the laboratory context,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.220]   that is bringing human subjects into the laboratory
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.260]   and examining what sorts of conditions
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.180]   allow them to engage their willpower and tenacity,
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.980]   what sorts of conditions really sap
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.860]   or drain their willpower and tenacity.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.420]   And of course, parallel experiments done
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.000]   in what we call preclinical models,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.140]   which are animal studies, have revealed to us a lot
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.840]   about the sorts of conditions
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.780]   that allow us to generate willpower
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.180]   and the sorts of conditions that drain our willpower.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.660]   Now, if we are to throw our arms around
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.460]   that entire literature,
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.620]   there is a big batch of that literature,
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.300]   not the whole batch,
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.660]   but there's a big batch of that literature
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.780]   that believed and still believes
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.500]   that willpower is a limited resource,
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.420]   much like fuel in the body or fuel in a car.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.260]   Now, the idea of willpower as a limited resource
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.780]   is certainly not a new idea,
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.660]   but again, the formal study of willpower
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.820]   and willpower as a limited resource
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.100]   really dates back a little over 20, 25 years
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.500]   when Roy Baumeister and colleagues
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.320]   started to explore the idea
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.580]   that of course had been kicked around for years,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.740]   that with each additional decision
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.480]   that we have to engage across the day
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.180]   and with each additional bout of willpower
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.920]   that we have to draw on as a resource,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.780]   that we would drain this reservoir of willpower
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.640]   that we all have within us.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.700]   Now, Baumeister and colleagues referred to that process
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.520]   as ego depletion.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.020]   Now, when people hear the word ego,
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.680]   some people think Freud, ego, super ego, id and so forth.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.280]   Most people think ego,
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.940]   like somebody having a big personality
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.260]   where they think a lot of themselves.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.580]   When Baumeister referred to ego depletion,
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.580]   he was defining ego depletion as a concept of oneself
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.860]   and a concept of outside challenges
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.300]   and the degree of effort required
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.340]   to bridge one's concept of self
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.600]   and those challenges.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.180]   And so ego depletion is really a operational construct
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.620]   within the field of psychology.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.260]   So we don't want to get too distracted by that word ego.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.480]   There's a tendency anytime people hear ego,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.980]   or they hear narcissism, or if they hear gaslighting,
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.220]   to immediately assume that they know what that means,
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.460]   when in fact the formal definitions of those
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.020]   quite often differ from the way that they're kicked around
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.300]   on social media, the internet,
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.260]   and even in a lot of popular writing about psychology.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.780]   Okay, so let's just note that ego depletion
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.340]   is the term that Baumeister used to describe
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.420]   the ability for our willpower to be depleted
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.780]   with each successive attempt to engage willpower,
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.740]   and by extension, our ability to replenish
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.780]   our degree of willpower if we take a break
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.300]   from making decisions and engaging our willpower.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.780]   But ego depletion itself isn't the focus right now.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.840]   The focus right now is whether or not indeed
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.200]   willpower is a limited resource
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.700]   and whether or not with each decision that we make
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.500]   and each effort to either engage in an activity
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.680]   that we prefer not to, at least in that moment,
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.700]   and with each attempt to resist a behavior,
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.460]   thought, et cetera, that is pulling on us,
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.500]   or that we feel that we want to engage in by default,
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.200]   either eating the cookie or thinking the thought,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.020]   or engaging in a particular type of behavior of any kind,
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.620]   and we need to resist that,
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.380]   that it is draining that willpower resource.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.980]   Now, before I go any further,
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.740]   I know that some of you out there are probably aware
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.380]   that ego depletion and the Baumeister theory
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.460]   of willpower as a limited resource
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.100]   has been very contentious, especially in recent years.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.580]   And so today, what I'm going to do
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.300]   is I'm going to first present the Baumeister
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.500]   and colleagues' work about willpower as a limited resource,
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.740]   and then I'm going to present
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.140]   some of the conflicting evidence that Carol Dweck,
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.860]   my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.900]   and researchers elsewhere have carried out meta-analyses
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.460]   and entirely new experiments, which indeed,
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.460]   in some cases, contradict the findings of Baumeister,
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.380]   but more often than not, contradict the conclusions
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.740]   that Baumeister drew about willpower.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.700]   So if we are to understand the psychology
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.540]   of willpower and tenacity,
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   it's important that we understand the concepts
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.800]   of ego depletion and willpower as a limited resource,
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.420]   even if, after hearing all the evidence,
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.060]   you decide that willpower is not a limited resource.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.380]   And in fact, I'm quite confident
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.080]   that once you hear about the Baumeister work,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.120]   and then you hear about the work of Dweck and others,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.340]   which in some ways counters the conclusions of Baumeister,
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.540]   that you'll have a much firmer
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.220]   and certainly a much more complete understanding
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.380]   about what tenacity and willpower are.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.220]   And perhaps, and here I'm revealing my own leanings
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.120]   when having examined the totality of the data,
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.460]   that tenacity and willpower in some cases
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.260]   is a limited resource that can be replenished
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.700]   by engaging particular processes within the body,
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.440]   that's right, within the body,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.100]   but that willpower and tenacity, and most importantly,
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.820]   how to engage tenacity and willpower,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.880]   especially when you have a lot of challenges
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.480]   in front of you, not just one challenge,
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   but multiple challenges that need to be carried out
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.080]   throughout the day, over weeks, over months, et cetera,
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.620]   that tenacity and willpower can be drawn upon repeatedly
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.700]   without them being depleted
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.340]   if you are clear on your beliefs
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.940]   about tenacity and willpower.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.820]   So I realized that what I just brought up
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.080]   was a controversy about something
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.580]   that I haven't even discussed yet,
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.160]   so it might seem like a bit of a swirl of information
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.900]   for which there's really no context,
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.300]   but the reason I bring up the controversy
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.100]   at this stage of our conversation
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.280]   is that the moment that the words ego depletion,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.620]   or willpower is a limited resource, falls out of my mouth,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.580]   I can hear those voices out there saying,
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.680]   "Wait a second, I thought that was all debunked."
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.280]   And I want to make very clear willpower is a limited resource
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.540]   and ego depletion have not been debunked,
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.140]   it's simply a controversial area of psychological research.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.560]   And more importantly for today's discussion,
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.300]   we have to understand the theory of willpower
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.640]   as a limited resource.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.820]   If we are to understand the controversy,
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.820]   that is the counter argument of what willpower really is,
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.920]   that comes from other groups.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.120]   So I really want to give you both sides of the story
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.560]   so that when we get to the underlying neural mechanisms
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.840]   for tenacity and willpower,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.820]   and we get to the tools and protocols
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.340]   for increasing your level of tenacity and willpower
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.620]   and your flexibility of willpower in different contexts,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.860]   that you'll be able to get the most out of those tools
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.940]   and protocols.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.380]   Okay, so let's take a look at the evidence
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.780]   that willpower is a limited resource.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.280]   I think most of us are familiar
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.660]   with what willpower feels like,
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.940]   that is what it feels like to be tenacious.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.340]   And again, there are two sides to this coin.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.140]   There's willpower and tenacity
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.940]   of the sort of trying to engage in a behavior
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.700]   when we really don't want to,
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.660]   or when our impulse is not to engage in that behavior.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.760]   And I say when our impulse is not to engage in that behavior
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.860]   because oftentimes we want to engage in the behavior,
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.500]   we want to study, we want to learn the instrument,
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.680]   we want to perform well, we want to exercise,
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.820]   we want the benefits of all those things.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.200]   So it's not that we don't want the outcomes
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.420]   or the rewards of those things.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.680]   And in many cases,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.740]   it's not that we don't enjoy those activities,
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.300]   but that for whatever reason,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.300]   we are feeling a lack of motivation.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.180]   We're drifting down that continuum
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.340]   toward the more apathetic end of things,
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.200]   hopefully not all the way to deep depression and apathy,
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.420]   but we're drifting that way,
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.900]   or we're not far enough up the continuum,
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.500]   and we're not engaging enough motivation
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.820]   to feel like the desire to do something,
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.060]   either for its own sake or for the rewards
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.260]   and outcomes of that thing,
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.420]   are sufficient to allow us to just do that thing.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.500]   Hence the Nike slogan, "Just do it,"
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.940]   which is a wonderful slogan,
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.980]   except that in the absence of any understanding
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.600]   about the mechanisms of how we can get ourselves
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.620]   to just do something, oftentimes it falls short.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.780]   And to be honest, anytime I hear about people saying,
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.200]   "Well, just eliminate the thinking and just do it,"
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.840]   that is valuable advice until it doesn't work,
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.620]   because when it doesn't work, it simply doesn't work.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.020]   And then you need to rely on other tools and mechanisms,
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.920]   which are the sort that we will talk about today.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.980]   So while I have great respect for the just do it mantra,
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.380]   when it doesn't work,
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.520]   it doesn't offer any alternative solutions
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.400]   to engage tenacity and willpower.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.900]   And I do not know anyone on this planet.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.340]   I don't care if you're David Goggins or Courtney Dewalter,
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.540]   there will be days when telling yourself,
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.700]   "Just do this," or "Just don't do that,"
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.200]   is not going to be sufficient for you to engage
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.320]   in the behaviors or resist the behaviors or thoughts
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.900]   that you need to engage in or resist.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.120]   That's just reality.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.580]   And we should ask ourselves, why is that reality?
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.080]   And this is a very important point.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.560]   And in fact, really illustrates the first bucket
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.240]   of tools and protocols for increasing tenacity
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.080]   and willpower.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   And these are the tools and protocols
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.040]   that I would categorize under the rubric of modulators.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.280]   I've talked before on this podcast
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.400]   about the important distinction
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.280]   between mediators and modulators.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.460]   Mediators are things,
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.260]   either psychological or biological, et cetera,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.360]   that are directly in the mechanisms
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.440]   that generate some sort of action or emotion.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.060]   This could be neurochemicals like dopamine
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.240]   or serotonin and so on.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.900]   Modulators are things that can modulate,
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.240]   that is, can change our probability of doing something
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.040]   or not doing something, but they do so indirectly.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.580]   And in the context of tools and protocols
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.880]   to increase our level of tenacity and willpower,
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.960]   I will be completely remiss if one of the sets of tools,
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.200]   that is the protocols, for increasing the probability
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.840]   that we can access high levels of tenacity and willpower
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.880]   didn't include at least some of these modulators.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.680]   So I'm just going to spend about three minutes
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.260]   on these modulators, because what we know for certain
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.360]   is that the regions of the brain that generate tenacity,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.040]   and again, there is literally a brain hub
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.120]   for generating willpower and tenacity,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.680]   gets strong input from the so-called
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.860]   autonomic nervous system.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.260]   The autonomic nervous system has two major components.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.180]   They are referred to as the sympathetic nervous system
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.840]   and the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.680]   Keep in mind, because when most people hear the word
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.300]   sympathetic, they think sympathy, they think emotion,
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.500]   it has nothing to do with that.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.840]   Simpa means together, and the sympathetic arm
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.440]   of the autonomic nervous system, I know that's a mouthful,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.800]   is responsible for generating states of alertness
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.920]   in our brain and body.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.900]   Everything from panic to being alert and calm,
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.360]   our tendency to move,
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.080]   or our likelihood of moving under pressure.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.160]   It is also responsible for our ability to resist movement
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.540]   when we need to resist movement,
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.100]   and therefore it's an active process.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.480]   So the sympathetic nervous system
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.960]   is all the things of action,
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   and when it is involved in generating inaction,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.120]   those are cases where inaction requires energy, okay?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.240]   I want to be very clear about this.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.300]   The sympathetic nervous system
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.320]   isn't just about moving our body,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.720]   although it has a lot to do with that,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.280]   it is also responsible for our ability to resist movement
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.000]   or thought or emotion when we need to do that,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.720]   clamp down on ourselves.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.860]   The parasympathetic aspect of our autonomic nervous system
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.280]   is the one that's sometimes referred to
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.080]   as the rest and digest neural circuits and chemicals.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.000]   And that's true, but there's a lot more to
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.520]   the parasympathetic component
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.040]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.140]   It's also responsible for falling asleep,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.080]   it's responsible for us feeling relaxed,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.180]   it is responsible for most of the states of mind and body
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.480]   in which we are quiescent,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.200]   where we don't feel an impulse to move,
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.840]   or when we have a difficult time getting into action.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.040]   So the sympathetic and the parasympathetic aspect
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.200]   of the autonomic nervous system
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.560]   are always in a push-pull with one another.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.680]   Think of them more or less on a teeter-totter,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.080]   when one end goes up, the other end goes down.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.300]   They're really in competition with one another,
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.040]   and it's their balance that reflects how alert
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.100]   or how sleepy we happen to be.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.240]   Now, the reason I'm giving you
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.640]   this rather geeky nerd-speak nomenclature-filled discussion
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.780]   about the autonomic nervous system
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.620]   in the context of willpower,
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.000]   is that regardless of whether or not you believe willpower
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.200]   is a limited or an unlimited resource,
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.160]   we know one thing for sure,
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.520]   and that's that willpower and tenacity
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.900]   ride on our current autonomic function.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.340]   We can translate that to everyday language
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.020]   by saying that when we are well-rested,
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.580]   for instance, when we've been getting great sleep
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.520]   of sufficient duration the previous night
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.220]   and the night before that,
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.320]   our level of tenacity and willpower to engage in things
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.340]   that we would not ordinarily engage in by default,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.440]   and our ability to resist behaviors and thought patterns
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.040]   that would otherwise be our default behaviors
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.520]   and thought patterns, is much higher.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.940]   Conversely, when we are not getting enough quality sleep
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.680]   on a regular basis,
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.220]   our ability to call on tenacity and willpower is diminished.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.160]   Now, that series of statements I just made
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.060]   is clearly going to be a duh for most people,
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.340]   but it is very important to understand
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.660]   that when we are sleep-deprived,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.960]   when we are in physical pain,
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.600]   when we are in emotional pain,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.920]   and/or when we are distracted,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.380]   when we are thinking about something else
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.480]   aside from what we are trying to engage tenacity
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.960]   and willpower in order to do or not do,
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.680]   tenacity and willpower will be diminished.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.160]   Now, all of those things together are just a bigger duh.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.000]   We all know this.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.640]   If you've got a splinter in your foot,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.620]   it's really hard to think about
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.440]   not thinking about something else.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.280]   If you are extremely hungry,
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.840]   or if you had an argument with somebody
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.680]   that you really care about,
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.360]   and they said something that was particularly vexing to you,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.220]   and it's looping around in your head,
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.960]   it's going to be very hard to engage in something else
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.000]   that you need to do because you're going to be distracted.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.380]   Likewise, if you're sleep-deprived,
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.560]   likewise, if you are a bit sick or run down,
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.280]   or if you're in any kind of physical or emotional pain,
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.040]   your ability to draw on tenacity and willpower
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.760]   will be diminished.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.080]   So it's an absolute truth
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.800]   that your ability to generate tenacity and willpower
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.480]   rides on a reservoir of autonomic function.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.320]   And today, we don't really have a way of quantifying
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.260]   the level of autonomic function or dysfunction
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.520]   in a very simple way.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.040]   It's not like resting heart rate,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   although resting heart rate is involved.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.200]   For instance, if you haven't slept well for a few nights,
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.660]   or if you're particularly stressed, over-trained,
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.600]   you'll wake up in the morning
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.700]   with a significantly elevated heart rate.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.760]   However, there is no simple metric like heart rate
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.120]   or blood pressure or even cortisol level
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.200]   that can tell you whether or not
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.720]   your autonomic function is in balance,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.520]   that is the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.080]   of your autonomic nervous system
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.860]   are in the best possible balance
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.640]   to generate tenacity and willpower.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.300]   We don't yet have such a metric,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.220]   although there are companies
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.060]   that are starting to develop devices
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.580]   that hopefully will give us indices
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.180]   of autonomic function or dysfunction.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.880]   But it is important that we acknowledge
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.380]   that if you're not taking care
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.160]   of the foundational modulators of tenacity and willpower,
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.140]   none of the subsequent tools and protocols
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.400]   that we will discuss
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.440]   are going to help you that much over time.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.580]   You might get tenacity and willpower to engage one day
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.740]   when you're very sleep deprived,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.180]   but it's going to be very difficult
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.680]   to consistently engage tenacity and willpower.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.880]   For that reason, if you have any struggles with sleep,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.120]   that is getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis,
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.540]   please see the zero cost toolkit for sleep
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.140]   that we've put at hubermanlab.com.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.100]   Please also see the perfect your sleep,
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.140]   master your sleep episodes also at hubermanlab.com.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.180]   And please also see the episode with expert guest,
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.420]   Dr. Matthew Walker, professor of sleep neuroscience
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.340]   and psychology at University of California, Berkeley.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.700]   We just revamped the Huberman Lab website.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.320]   So if you go to hubermanlab.com
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.420]   and you put something like sleep into the search function,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.480]   it will take you not just to the toolkit for sleep,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.880]   but to the exact timestamps
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.380]   that will queue up particular topics
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.380]   and protocols around sleep.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.960]   So if you were to put sleep and light,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.620]   it would take you to those particular protocols.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.260]   If you were to put sleep and magnesium threonate,
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.840]   it would take you to those particular protocols
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.140]   and so on and so forth.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.300]   I don't want to get too far off topic here
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   during today's discussion,
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.100]   but if you're not sleeping well,
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.900]   and if you're not managing your stress levels well,
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.500]   it's going to be much harder
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.700]   for you to engage tenacity and willpower,
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.980]   regardless of the tools you happen to use.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.100]   And those tools could be everything from behavioral tools
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.840]   to supplements, to prescription drugs.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.940]   You need to get those foundational modulators in check.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.140]   And there are a lot of zero cost ways to do that
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.720]   that are all spelled out very clearly
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.380]   at the resources I just described.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.500]   Likewise for stress,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.020]   if you're experiencing challenges with stress,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.440]   both short-term, medium-term or long-term stress,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.180]   if you think you have elevated cortisol levels,
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.380]   which by the way, may not be the case,
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.040]   there are a lot of tools for modulating stress in real time,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.680]   increasing your stress threshold, et cetera.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.560]   Simply go to the kubermanlab.com website
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.620]   and put in stress threshold tools
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.320]   or stress real-time tools,
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.540]   and you'll get a bunch of zero cost tools
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.060]   that will allow you to do that.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.100]   It's also worth mentioning
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.380]   that when we get to our discussion
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.720]   about the neuroscience of tenacity and willpower,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.100]   that you will understand why autonomic health
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.660]   and autonomic function is so important
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.880]   for our ability to engage tenacity and willpower.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.780]   I'll just tell you right now,
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.220]   it's because the neural circuits
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.600]   of the autonomic nervous system
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.160]   provide direct and robust input to this hub in the brain,
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.260]   this brain location that governs our ability
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.320]   to allocate our mind and body toward particular activities
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.520]   or to resist particular activities.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.100]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.560]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.860]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.700]   that's designed to meet
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.940]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.560]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.860]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.120]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.780]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.760]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.520]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.680]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.480]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.000]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.240]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.040]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.800]   "If you could take just one supplement, what would it be?"
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.480]   I answer, "AG1."
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.200]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.660]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.420]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.080]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.040]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.360]   Okay, so let's think about the Baumeister data
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.120]   on willpower as a limited resource.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.980]   I'm going to briefly describe one of the first studies
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.960]   that really said to the field,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.260]   "Willpower is a limited resource."
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.180]   But I want to be clear that there are other studies like it,
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.400]   and they all generally follow the same contour.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.360]   And that general contour is as follows.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.520]   Baumeister and colleagues,
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.040]   and now many other laboratories, have done experiments
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.240]   where they bring human subjects into the laboratory.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.040]   And those human subjects have to do something
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.840]   that requires mental effort or energy, aka willpower.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.280]   The classic example of this is you bring people
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.540]   into the laboratory.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.240]   Some of them might actually be dieting or fasted,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.520]   although not always.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.600]   And there are two platters set out for them.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.280]   One platter contains radishes, just plain radishes.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.040]   By the way, I hate radishes unless they're pickled radishes.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.980]   I don't know why that is.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.900]   So these experiments picked my least favorite vegetable.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.460]   I love many other vegetables.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.300]   I disdain the radish.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.760]   That was just a personal editorial.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.160]   In any case, the radishes are set out,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.520]   and next to them are freshly baked cookies.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.780]   And in the room is the wafting aromas
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.520]   of freshly baked cookies.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.040]   So I think it's fair to say that most people,
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.720]   because of a hardwired tendency to like sugar and fat,
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.840]   especially when they are combined,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.080]   would prefer to eat the cookies versus the radishes.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.940]   I know that there are some mutants out there
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.760]   that are saying, "I like radishes more than cookies."
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.120]   But look, most people like cookies more than radishes.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.040]   The subjects in these studies are divided into two groups.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.960]   One group is told you have to resist eating the radishes.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.920]   The other group is told you have to resist
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.880]   eating the cookies.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.120]   And then the subjects are observed
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.040]   during this time, typically.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.880]   But this is really not what the experiment is about per se.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.700]   This stage of the experiment is really designed
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.600]   to get people to resist a certain kind of behavior.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.960]   And the assumption, again, this is an assumption
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.380]   'cause there's no brain recordings here.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.760]   No one's in an MRI machine looking at what brain areas
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.000]   are activated or not activated.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.400]   There's no cortisol being measured,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   at least not in these early experiments.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.280]   These people are either resisting something
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.040]   that's pretty easy to resist, radishes,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.900]   or they are being asked to resist something
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.920]   that for most people is going to be harder to resist
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.400]   than resisting radishes,
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.360]   which is resisting freshly baked cookies.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.980]   And that challenge has been made even more difficult
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.060]   by the wafting aromas of freshly baked cookies in the room.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.380]   And in some cases has been made even more difficult
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.840]   because these people are dieting.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.420]   And keep in mind that when you calorie restrict
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.840]   or when you put yourself on a diet of any kind,
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.040]   there is a well-established mechanism in the brain
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.000]   by which the neurons that engage hunger,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.120]   especially hunger for fat and sugar,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.840]   and that respond to things like aromas and tastes
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   are heightened, that is their activity levels are heightened,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.320]   which means that things that smell really good,
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.500]   smell really, really good when you're hungry.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.300]   Things that ordinarily would taste really good,
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.040]   taste really, really, really good when you finally eat them.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   So the key component of this stage of the experiment
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.820]   is to engage people's willpower.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.980]   The second part of the experiment has all of the subjects
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.240]   separately engage in another challenging task.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.200]   And the challenging task that they are asked to engage in
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.080]   is to solve a particular puzzle.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.320]   And again, different experiments use different puzzles,
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.460]   different experiments use different contexts,
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.280]   but the original experiments that Baumeister
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.560]   and colleagues did had people try and solve a puzzle
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.240]   that could not be solved.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.280]   So it's very, very difficult, in fact, it's impossible.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.920]   But the subjects weren't aware of that.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.080]   And then what was measured was how long subjects persisted
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   in trying to solve this impossible to solve puzzle,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.520]   depending on whether or not previously
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.840]   they had to resist the radishes,
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.440]   which is pretty easy to resist,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.940]   or resist the cookies, which is at least harder to resist,
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.840]   and for some people would be very, very hard to resist.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.080]   Now, you can probably already guess
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   what the outcome of this and similar studies was,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.920]   because it birthed this entire belief camp
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.660]   within the field of psychology,
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.660]   that willpower is a limited resource.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.040]   The outcome was that if people had to resist the cookies,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.600]   which is harder to do than resisting the radishes,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.560]   that they would persist for less time
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.860]   when they had to try and solve a puzzle
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.720]   that unbeknownst to them could not be solved.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.900]   Conversely, if people had to resist something
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.160]   that was pretty easy to resist,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.400]   such as resisting eating radishes,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.840]   something that for me would be very, very easy to resist,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.240]   well, when they were subsequently faced
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.620]   with trying to solve a very difficult,
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.660]   indeed impossible to solve puzzle,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.900]   they persisted much longer.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.400]   Okay, so put very simply, this study concluded
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.860]   that if you have to resist one thing
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.420]   and it's a hard thing to resist,
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.000]   well, then you have less, air quotes here,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.280]   resistance in you, willpower,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.220]   to engage in another difficult task subsequently.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.600]   Whereas if you had an easy challenge just prior
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.640]   or no challenge just prior to being faced with a challenge,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.740]   such as a very difficult puzzle,
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.700]   well, then you had more resource,
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.100]   more willpower to apply to the solving of that puzzle.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.300]   So the conclusion that Baumeister and colleagues drew
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.160]   from those results was that willpower is a limited resource,
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.540]   but it didn't specify, nor did they specify,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.560]   exactly what that limited resource is.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.140]   And this was quite an attractive theory
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.380]   because it jived well with most people's perception
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.280]   of what willpower and tenacity was for them.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.300]   This idea that, yes, there are things that challenge us,
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.380]   both to do and to resist, but that we can do that.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.880]   But when we are asked to do that again and again and again,
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.300]   while we may build up some capacity
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.660]   to engage our willpower and tenacity,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.380]   and of course there are those rare individuals
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.700]   that we've heard about and some of us know
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.860]   that seem to have just a kind of bottomless reservoir
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.580]   of willpower and tenacity,
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.900]   most of us have an intuitive understanding
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.020]   of how hard it is to constantly be in friction with life,
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.140]   to constantly have to push ourselves to do things
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.300]   and to resist things.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.340]   And that while that capacity can expand and grow
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.780]   and we can get better at it,
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.500]   that there does seem to be something,
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.280]   here just subjectively speaking,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.100]   there does seem to be something
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.460]   about engaging tenacity and willpower that,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.540]   yeah, I can feel good, but it also requires effort,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.700]   this neural energy that we were talking about.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.140]   So that raised the question of,
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.660]   okay, if willpower is a limited resource,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.460]   what exactly is that resource at a physiological level?
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.500]   So Baumeister and colleagues subsequently went on to explore
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.060]   what I think is a really interesting and clever idea.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.940]   Frankly, I can't confess that I would have thought of this,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.860]   but they did.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.780]   They said, okay, in some cases people are eating the cookie
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.740]   and then they're engaging in this very difficult puzzle.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.620]   In other cases, they're eating the radish
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.940]   and engaging in this difficult puzzle.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.940]   And of course other experiments
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.460]   used non-food challenging choices,
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.820]   but they came up with an idea which was the brain
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.900]   as one of the most metabolically active organs
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.620]   in our entire body, if not the most metabolically active
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.820]   organ in our entire body, requires a lot of fuel.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.780]   It requires a lot of glucose.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:27.580]   Now, of course the brain mainly runs on glucose,
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.420]   but if you're following a ketogenic diet,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.220]   your brain will mainly run on ketones.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.400]   But for most people who are omnivores
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.980]   or eating carbohydrates,
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.140]   glucose is the main and preferred fuel source for neurons,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.180]   for nerve cells in your brain and body for that matter.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.060]   Baumeister and colleagues raised the hypothesis
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.300]   that perhaps glucose availability itself
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.180]   is the resource that's limiting willpower.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.520]   And in a whole set of experiments,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.080]   they really showed that if people are asked
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.700]   to do a difficult task, to engage their willpower,
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.120]   and this could be done by resisting a particular behavior
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.240]   or by engaging in a particular behavior.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.460]   I'll just give you an example
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.980]   of engaging in a particular behavior
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.020]   that requires willpower or at least focus and mental energy.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.500]   To contrast it with the resisting radishes
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.420]   versus resisting cookies example that I gave earlier.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.500]   One common practice within experiments like this
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.540]   is to give people a very long passage of words,
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.340]   so it's a story, and then to give them some sort of rule
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.700]   about how to edit that passage.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.800]   Maybe they have to cross out every third E
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.060]   or the E's that arrive in the middle of sentences
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.060]   next to consonants, but not other vowels,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.880]   stuff that takes a lot of energy.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.000]   So these are do's as opposed to resisting behaviors,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.080]   like we were talking about earlier,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.760]   resisting the radish, resisting the cookies.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.120]   Although in many of these experiments,
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.520]   there's a command to do something,
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.840]   cross out certain letter E's in this passage,
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:55.720]   but also to resist the reflex to cross out other E's.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.960]   And of course, all of this is under time pressure
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.520]   and oftentimes it's being rewarded or scored.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.880]   This is the way that psychology researchers get people
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.960]   to engage in particular experiments and behaviors
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.880]   and resist certain things
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.460]   in the context of a laboratory environment
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.020]   when those things frankly are kind of boring
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.560]   and meaningless, they'll pay you more
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   if you do well at the task.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.280]   They'll give you money and then subtract the money
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.200]   that you're going to get at the end of the experiment
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.640]   if you make errors and things like that,
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.840]   and they'll do it under time constraint
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   as I mentioned earlier.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.800]   So there were lots of different conditions for,
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.680]   again, here, air quotes, draining people's willpower
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.720]   and tenacity and certainly draining their mental attention.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:38.160]   And then they would have them do another subsequent task.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.000]   So in many ways,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.160]   this just mirrors the first cookie radish experiment
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.000]   done by Baumeister and colleagues,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.080]   but there was an important intervention
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.120]   put between the first and the second hard task.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.760]   And that intervention was to give one group
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.060]   a glucose beverage of about 150 calories or so.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.440]   So they would drink a glucose beverage
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.120]   to increase levels of blood glucose,
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.160]   the preferred fuel source for the brain,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   versus giving them an artificially flavored drink
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.640]   or just water or something that was,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.220]   of course, matched for flavor,
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.560]   but that did not contain any glucose or calories.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.940]   Now, this is a clever experimental design
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.100]   if you think about it,
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.720]   because at least at a first glance,
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.680]   the only thing that really seems to be different
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   is the availability of glucose for the brain.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.720]   And you can probably guess
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.200]   what the outcome of these studies was.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.400]   The outcome of these studies
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.240]   was that when subjects are given glucose
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.200]   in between a first hard task that required willpower
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.280]   and a second hard task that required willpower,
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.640]   and in some experiments,
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.220]   a third hard task that required willpower,
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.440]   that their levels of willpower were maintained consistently
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.040]   from one task to the next,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.640]   and in some cases increased from one task to the next
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.300]   if they had more glucose available
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.660]   because they drank this glucose drink.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.720]   So what's really interesting
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.840]   and frankly really nice about these studies
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.720]   is that they attempted to bridge a psychological construct
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.600]   like tenacity and willpower.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.640]   And to test the argument
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.160]   that willpower is an expendable resource,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.480]   and yet it's an expendable resource that is replenishable
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.680]   by linking that to a physiological variable.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.720]   And the physiological variable they linked it to
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.560]   was glucose availability in the brain.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.600]   Now, this set the field of psychology,
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.860]   and in fact, the field of pop psychology,
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.400]   that is the discussion about formal findings
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.520]   in the field of formal psychological research ablaze.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.360]   People were so excited about this.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.960]   I mean, this set of findings really pointed to the argument
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.440]   that if you could just keep levels
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.840]   of brain glucose elevated across your day,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.220]   or at least stable across the day,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.360]   that you would have more willpower and tenacity,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.760]   this thing that humans have been seeking more of
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.420]   since the beginning of time.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.380]   Now, all of that seemed fine and good,
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.400]   and in fact, a lot of products and courses
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.660]   were born out of that literature.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.080]   People were arguing that you should sip on a glucose drink
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.800]   while doing any kind of hard task,
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.760]   that you should sip on glucose drinks between tasks,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.720]   that you should be thinking about literally
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.400]   fuel that you ingest into your body
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.640]   as fuel for psychological processes within your brain
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.960]   that would allow you to perform better in work, in school,
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.520]   in athletics, in relationships,
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.420]   in all of the domains of life.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.460]   But of course, anytime there is a prominence
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.080]   or a real excitement about a particular finding
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.760]   in any field of science, but in particular in psychology
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.160]   where it feels so applicable, as did the Baumeister results,
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.760]   you are going to get other groups
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.840]   that are going to try and replicate those findings
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.480]   and that are going to dig into the findings themselves
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.040]   and look at the statistics,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.040]   look at how well or poorly powered those studies were.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.520]   We don't want to get into a full discussion
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.140]   about powering studies right now,
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.160]   but powering studies has a lot to do
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.480]   with addressing the question of whether or not
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.020]   there were enough subjects in the study
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.920]   to really draw the conclusions that one drew
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.040]   or whether or not the statistics fell out as,
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.480]   yes, there was a significant effect of glucose ingestion
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.220]   on willpower and tenacity,
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.020]   but if there weren't enough subjects,
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.600]   well, then there are other variables
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.440]   that could potentially explain those results.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.980]   So there were a lot of meta-analyses and other studies
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.960]   trying to replicate the work of Baumeister
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.320]   and that's where things got controversial.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.540]   Now, we can take a step back from all of that controversy.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.400]   After all, we don't want to spend too much time
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.800]   on the controversy itself.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.320]   Rather, we want to know what the counter-interpretation
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.260]   of the Baumeister results was.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.040]   And I want to be very clear.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.160]   There was no real dispute as to whether or not
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.160]   Baumeister got the results that he and his colleagues
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.680]   claimed to have obtained.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.840]   They did get those results.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.920]   The question really was about the interpretation.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.560]   Is willpower a limited resource?
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.640]   And if it is, is the physiological resource itself
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.840]   glucose availability to the brain?
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.280]   So in 2013, a colleague of mine at Stanford,
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.120]   Dr. Carol Dweck in our department of psychology,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.400]   did a study in which she examined this idea
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.480]   that willpower is a limited resource
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.040]   and the idea that the resource that's limited
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.740]   is glucose availability for the brain.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.500]   So Dweck and colleagues did an experiment
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.200]   that in many ways mirrored the overall organization
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.660]   of the experiments done by Baumeister and colleagues.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.440]   There was a difficult task.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.680]   In some cases, the difficult task was that crossing out
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.320]   of particular ease within a passage task
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.160]   followed by another difficult task.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.940]   And the difficult task that came second
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.100]   was the Stroop task.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.320]   This is a task I've talked about before on this podcast,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.900]   although some episodes ago.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.220]   So those of you that are not familiar with the Stroop task,
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.800]   the Stroop task is where subjects are presented
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.780]   with words in different colors
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.000]   and they are instructed to either read the word,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.520]   so to pay attention to the content of the word
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.360]   or to the color in which the font of the word is written.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.520]   This might seem pretty easy to most of you, right?
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.400]   If I put up a card that says Apple on it
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.800]   and Apple is written in green,
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.280]   you probably wouldn't have a hard time
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.120]   if you had been instructed to tell me
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.620]   what color is the word written in for you to say green, okay?
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.200]   But if I were to hold up a card that said red,
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.480]   but the font is actually in the color green,
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.600]   it's a little bit harder.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.100]   And if I were to then do that for 100 cards or 300 cards
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.700]   and put you under time pressure,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.840]   where you're losing money that you're sure to get
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.360]   if you make mistakes or you will earn money
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.400]   at the end of the experiment if you get answers correctly,
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.240]   well, then you start making more mistakes.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.520]   That's just the way these experiments work.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.780]   So they did a variation on the Stroop task
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.340]   that isn't exactly the way I just described it.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.760]   And the Stroop task, by the way,
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.840]   is one that's used to probe prefrontal cortex function,
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.300]   this area of our brain right behind our foreheads
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.900]   that is responsible for many things,
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.900]   but in part is responsible for context and strategy setting
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.920]   given a particular set of rules.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.360]   So if you get onto the bus or get onto the subway
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.860]   versus walk into a black tie dinner,
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.000]   the context and rules are very, very different
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.560]   as to what you would say or not say,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.960]   how you would behave, how you address.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.160]   Your prefrontal cortex is largely, although not entirely,
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.720]   is largely responsible for a lot of the context setting
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.240]   and rule setting from one situation to the next.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.320]   And if you think about the Stroop task,
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.280]   it's really just a context dependent strategy task.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.940]   You either have to pay attention to the meaning of the words
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.520]   or the colors in which those words are written.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.920]   And the number of mistakes that you'll make
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.400]   depends on how much time pressure you're under,
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.680]   what sorts of neurologic or psychiatric challenges
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.960]   you might be facing or not facing, so on and so forth.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   But it's a very robust task that's existed
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.240]   in the scientific literature for a long period of time.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.560]   So the Dweck experiment, and by the way,
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.360]   there were actually three experiments in this paper.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.400]   I won't go through all of them in detail for sake of time,
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.000]   but I will provide a link to the paper
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.120]   in the show note captions.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.360]   But the major focus of the study
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.960]   was to have people engage in one hard task
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.480]   and then in another hard task,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.800]   both of which draw on willpower,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.160]   testing the idea that willpower is a limited resource
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.740]   and then providing some of those subjects
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.880]   with a glucose rich drink
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.720]   or other subjects with a drink
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.240]   that was artificially sweetened.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.420]   So it had no glucose, no calories, but tasted.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.880]   Yes, they matched them for taste.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.260]   I know some of you who don't like artificial sweeteners
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.180]   are saying those don't taste exactly like a real sugar,
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.060]   but they managed to match these drinks for taste.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:06.900]   But in one case,
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.600]   the drink would clearly increase blood glucose.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.380]   In the other case, the drink would not raise blood glucose.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.020]   So the results of this study are really spectacular
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.580]   in my mind, because what this study found was that yes,
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.280]   indeed, ingesting glucose can improve performance
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   on these multiple challenging willpower requiring tasks.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.540]   However, the degree to which the glucose containing drink
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.320]   could improve performance
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.240]   depended on whether or not you believed
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.420]   that willpower was a limited resource
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.960]   and whether or not you believe that resource was glucose.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.580]   In other words, if you hear and believe
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.120]   that willpower is a limited resource,
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.140]   well then indeed, with each subsequent task
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.440]   that you engage in or life event of any kind
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.600]   that you engage in that requires willpower and tenacity,
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.780]   you will have less willpower and tenacity to draw on.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.500]   Whereas if you believe that willpower and tenacity
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.780]   are unlimited and in fact are divorced from blood glucose
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:10.160]   as the physiological source of willpower and tenacity,
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.440]   well then you can engage in one challenging task
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.240]   and another challenging task and another challenging task
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.000]   without any diminishment in performance.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.320]   Now that of course leaves us all in a very tough position
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.000]   because how are we to decide what to believe
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.560]   if we know that willpower can be a limited resource
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.320]   or willpower can not be a limited resource?
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.620]   Ah, well, the results of the Dweck study,
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.200]   and by the way, I should share with you
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.080]   the title of the study.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.420]   The title of the study, not surprisingly,
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.480]   is "Beliefs About Willpower Determine the Impact
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.760]   of Glucose on Self-Control."
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.320]   And this was a study published in the proceedings
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.560]   of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.720]   Again, I'll provide a link to this study
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.840]   in the show note captions.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.240]   There are three major experiments in this study,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.580]   as I mentioned before.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.520]   I just gave you the major conclusion of all of them,
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.120]   sort of woven together.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.480]   And if it wasn't clear already,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.440]   the major conclusions are that, yes, ingesting glucose
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.880]   can improve your ability to engage tenacity and willpower,
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.020]   AKA self-control, from one task to the next,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.880]   provided that you believe that glucose
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.520]   is the limiting resource
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.000]   for engaging tenacity and willpower.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.560]   If you don't believe that,
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.640]   well, then you can engage tenacity and willpower
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.240]   without ingesting glucose.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.960]   And that's where the artificially flavored drink comes in.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.640]   I'll leave it to you to kind of unpack
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.120]   what that means experimentally.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.400]   But it's a very clever experimental design
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.880]   that Dweck and colleagues came up with,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.600]   because it argues that, yes, indeed,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.040]   it's hard to do a challenging thing
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.060]   right after another challenging thing.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.200]   But there's no reason to think
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.220]   that you can't do both of those things
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.480]   while engaging the utmost tenacity and willpower
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.900]   if you believe that tenacity and willpower
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:48.780]   exist within you as a single mechanism that can be harnessed
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.820]   and that it's not a single mechanism
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.140]   that has a reservoir that runs down
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.060]   as you engage in one hard thing to the next.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.080]   Now, this is very important
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.480]   because we are about to transition
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.600]   into our discussion of the physiological,
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.620]   that is the neural underpinnings of tenacity and willpower,
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.260]   which, as it turns out, is one major set of brain circuits.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.920]   Now, there could be others that are yet to be discovered,
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.740]   but we know that there is one major set of brain circuits,
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.140]   in particular, one brain area, believe it or not,
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.900]   that an entire collection of more than two dozen studies
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.140]   really points to as the seat,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.260]   the origin of what we call tenacity and willpower.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.760]   But before we transition to that
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.420]   and the tools and protocols
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.020]   that that physiological neural understanding
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.080]   set forth for us to all use and apply,
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.940]   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.420]   that Baumeister wasn't about to hear these results
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.340]   from Dweck and colleagues and just say,
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.980]   okay, willpower is not a limited resource.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:47.980]   It's not blood glucose.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.740]   It's all what you believe about willpower.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.500]   It's all what you believe about blood glucose.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:56.020]   Rather, Baumeister himself went back to the lab
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.500]   and did subsequent experiments
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.860]   that in some ways, not all, counter the Dweck results.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.540]   So I'm not trying to confuse anybody,
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.640]   but I wouldn't be doing my job
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.740]   if I didn't give you both sides of the story.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.560]   Now, the good news is that the tools and protocols
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.260]   that we are going to arrive at
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.060]   work regardless of which psychological camp
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.940]   you happen to be in, the Baumeister camp or the Dweck camp.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.980]   Now, I don't want to give the impression
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.260]   that these are warring camps,
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.940]   and I also don't want to give the impression
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.880]   that these are the only two camps of thought
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.140]   and experimentation within the field
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.260]   of tenacity and willpower.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.300]   There are many groups working on these subjects.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.980]   Indeed, there have been meta-analyses
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.480]   that have confirmed the major theories of Baumeister
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.900]   and there are meta-analyses
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:39.320]   that have refuted the major findings of Baumeister.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.260]   I will provide links in the show note captions
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.700]   to a couple examples of each
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.620]   so that you have those to peruse if you like.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.920]   But let's discuss for a moment what Baumeister found
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.580]   when they went back and re-researched,
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.100]   I think that's a word, re-researched the idea
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.220]   that willpower is a limited resource
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.940]   and that glucose is that limiting resource.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:00.020]   Baumeister and colleagues looked at the Dweck data
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.660]   and said, okay, fine, the data looked great,
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.940]   except for the fact that in real life
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.320]   and in many previous experiments
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.440]   that they and others had done,
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.580]   it wasn't just two hard challenges back to back,
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.760]   but often two or three or four.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.920]   And what Baumeister and others found
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.440]   was that when subjects are presented
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.740]   not with just two challenges back to back,
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.440]   but three or more challenges,
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.120]   so back to back to back to back,
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.020]   challenges that have to engage a lot of neural energy,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.620]   a lot of willpower, tenacity,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.540]   resistance to do certain things,
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.880]   and effort to engage in certain kinds of behaviors
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.580]   and cognitive processes,
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.900]   that when subjects had glucose available to them
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.580]   in the brain by way of ingesting these glucose drinks,
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.380]   sipping those in between the tasks,
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.140]   sometimes even during the tasks,
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.300]   that their performance,
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.300]   that is their willpower and tenacity
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.700]   to engage in challenges,
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.140]   was maintained across those multiple challenges.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.720]   And they conceded that one's belief about willpower
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.660]   could indeed dictate whether or not willpower
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.560]   was or was not a limited resource,
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.320]   and whether glucose would or would not
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.920]   enhance one's ability to engage willpower.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.500]   But they argued that if one confronts
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.880]   multiple challenging circumstances,
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.740]   as is very naturalistic, as we say,
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.460]   it's very typical of everyday real life,
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.360]   then the availability of glucose during and between tasks,
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.000]   the ability for the brain to engage
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.360]   in its external environment
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.700]   and take reads of its internal environment,
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:35.980]   how we feel inside relative to what's expected of us,
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:39.640]   was very valuable in allowing people to engage this thing
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.300]   that psychologically we described
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.380]   as tenacity and willpower.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.960]   I'd like to just take a brief break
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.820]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.240]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.460]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:55.100]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.920]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.760]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.600]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.260]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.480]   also called neurons.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.160]   Now, people of course have varying levels
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.760]   of requirements for sodium.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.840]   So people with hypertension or prehypertension
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.840]   probably shouldn't increase their sodium.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.760]   However, many people are surprised to find
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.680]   that by increasing their sodium intake,
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.400]   they are able to function better cognitively and physically.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.320]   And that's because a lot of people,
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.480]   especially people who are following low carbohydrate
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.220]   or even moderate carbohydrate and really clean diets,
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.820]   oftentimes are excreting a lot of water
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.000]   and electrolytes along with it.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.260]   And simply by increasing their electrolyte intake
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.060]   using Element, they just feel better and function better.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.120]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.240]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.020]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.280]   And while I do any kind of physical training,
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.120]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.600]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna,
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.280]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.260]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.840]   That's lmnt.com/huberman

[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.400]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.620]   Let's talk about the physiology of tenacity and willpower.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.520]   And I assure you that the conversation
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.600]   we are about to have is not going to be
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.660]   just a bunch of nomenclature and mechanistic understanding
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.640]   of the origins of tenacity and willpower.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.740]   Rather, it argues that tenacity and willpower
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:19.820]   have a unified source.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.780]   That is a specific set of brain areas that when active,
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.740]   engage that feeling of tenacity and willpower
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.680]   regardless of what we are confronted with,
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   regardless of whether or not we are trying to engage
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.400]   in something that reflexively
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.060]   we wouldn't otherwise want to engage in,
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.380]   and regardless of whether or not we are confronted
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.960]   with something that we have to resist.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.420]   And to me, that's extremely reassuring.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.280]   Because whether or not you believe that blood glucose
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.640]   is the limiting resource for willpower,
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.560]   whether or not you believe that your beliefs about willpower
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.640]   and blood glucose impact your level of willpower,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.320]   what we know for sure is that there's a single set
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.620]   of brain circuits.
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.300]   Indeed, there's a single brain area
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.260]   that seems to be able to largely,
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.800]   if not entirely explain this phenomenon
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.320]   that we call tenacity and willpower.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.860]   And that should be reassuring because what it means
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.360]   is that tenacity and willpower is the reflection
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.740]   of a neural circuit function that is a skill.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.440]   It's an expression of something that we all have within us.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.100]   We all have this particular brain area.
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.080]   And quite excitingly, this is the third point,
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.980]   this brain area is highly subject to plasticity.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.280]   There are specific things that we can do,
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.080]   and there are specific mindsets that we can adopt
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.560]   that allow us to increase the activity
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.120]   of this particular brain area,
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.040]   indeed to increase the size of this particular brain area
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.680]   so that we can call on tenacity and willpower,
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.480]   not just in one circumstance like school,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.800]   or musical learning, or athletic endeavors,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.400]   or relationship endeavors,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.880]   but rather that we can call on this brain area
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.840]   in the context of any and all circumstances
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.420]   where willpower and tenacity are required.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.160]   Now, we talk about neuroscience a lot on this podcast,
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.480]   but it's not often that I point to a particular brain area
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.240]   and can confidently say this particular brain area
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.320]   has an absolutely integral role
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.660]   in something as kind of high level psychological
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.280]   as tenacity and willpower.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.680]   But today we can do that.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.420]   And that's because there's a collection
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.240]   of more than two dozen studies
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.660]   that point to one particular brain area.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.140]   And of course, it's connections with other brain areas
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.200]   because no single brain area operates in isolation.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.240]   Every brain area is operating in the context
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.120]   of neural circuits, other brain areas
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.840]   that it receives inputs from
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.640]   and gives inputs to and so on.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.720]   But this one particular brain area
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.220]   really does seem to underlie
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.080]   what we call tenacity and willpower.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.640]   And we know that through several lines of evidence.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.820]   First of all, I'll tell you the name of the brain area,
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.820]   although the name itself isn't going to tell you much
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.700]   unless you're a neuroscientist or anatomist.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.440]   So I'll give a little bit of background about it.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.820]   The name of the brain area
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.120]   is the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.240]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.080]   is part of a larger brain area called the cingulate cortex.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.020]   And in humans versus animals,
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.620]   it goes by slightly different names, unfortunately.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.320]   It's just one of the consequences of different researchers
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.480]   in different labs calling the same thing different things.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.300]   It'd be really frustrating, but we'll make it very simple
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.240]   because today we will refer to this area
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.620]   as the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.120]   which is a subdivision of a larger brain area
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.860]   simply called the cingulate cortex.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.040]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.800]   resides in the frontal lobes.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.040]   So it's behind your forehead,
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.340]   although that doesn't tell you anything
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.000]   because all of your brain is behind your forehead
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.420]   if you think about it.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.740]   And it's about a third of the way back
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:43.400]   toward the back of your head.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.560]   And you actually have two of these structures,
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.560]   two anterior mid-singulate cortices,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.360]   one on each side of the brain,
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.260]   and they receive a lot of inputs
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.680]   from a lot of different areas.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.020]   And we'll talk about what those areas are
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.540]   because this is extremely important
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.140]   when thinking about the different psychological
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.160]   and physiological resources that you can draw upon
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.180]   to engage tenacity and willpower.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.780]   But for the time being,
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.440]   let me just go through the evidence
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.620]   and kind of list format of why we feel so confident
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.900]   that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.660]   is such a vital hub for engaging tenacity and willpower.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.380]   For each of these points that I'm about to make,
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.120]   there is indeed at least one,
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:26.680]   if not several quality peer-reviewed studies in humans.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.900]   So there's a lot of data from animals,
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.720]   both rodents and primate models, et cetera,
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.400]   that we're not talking about today,
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.580]   but I should mention all of which supports the human data
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.260]   and vice versa.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.460]   The data I'm going to describe now come from humans
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.980]   and from a variety of different types of studies.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.140]   So there are a lot of different ways
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.300]   that one can consider if a brain area is implicated
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.020]   in a given psychological or physiological phenomenon
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:55.200]   like motivation or sadness or visual perception.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.340]   And those include, for instance,
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:01.060]   if a brain area is active during a given phenomenon.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.100]   So one way to explore this is to put
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.420]   literally wire electrodes down below the skull,
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.420]   record the electric activity of neurons
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.100]   and assess whether or not the electrical activity
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.060]   of those neurons changes when a person is, say,
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.700]   viewing faces or feeling a particular way,
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.860]   like feeling tenacious or feeling bored
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.980]   or feeling aggressive and so on.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.780]   Another way of assessing a particular brain area's role
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.700]   in a given physiological or psychological phenomenon
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.180]   is in individuals where that particular brain area
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.820]   is injured, you might expect that a particular phenomenon,
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:35.180]   like willpower, like the ability to perceive faces,
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.640]   is present or absent, whether or not it's exacerbated
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.580]   or whether or not it's diminished.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:41.880]   Other ways of assessing whether or not
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.440]   a given brain area is involved in a given phenomenon
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.460]   is whether or not that brain area literally changes size,
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.020]   whether or not it changes in volume
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.960]   over the course of some sort of training.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.500]   So for instance, if somebody is not able
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.900]   to play a musical instrument, such as myself,
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.340]   and then I or a subject in one of these experiments
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.620]   learns a musical instrument and the volume,
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.840]   the size of the particular brain area is assessed
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.660]   across the learning or simply before and after
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.860]   that musical learning, and it grows,
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.160]   or perhaps even if it shrinks or changes shape,
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.860]   one might determine that it is somehow,
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.940]   somehow involved in the process
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.060]   of learning a musical instrument.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.000]   You couldn't unequivocally conclude that,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.260]   but along with other types of evidence,
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.860]   one could perhaps conclude that.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.380]   So that's just a partial list of ways
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.700]   to assess brain area function.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.700]   Other ways include assessing what other areas
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.060]   a given brain area gets input from.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.000]   So for instance, in the case of the anterior
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.440]   mid-singulate cortex, we will soon discuss the fact
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.740]   that it gets robust input from the autonomic nervous system,
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.560]   which you already learned about.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.500]   It gets robust input from reward systems of the brain,
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.580]   such as the dopamine and serotonin-based reward systems
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.400]   of the brain, and it gets robust input from the context
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.800]   and strategy setting areas of the brain as well,
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.080]   and many other different brain areas.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.560]   So there's a structural logic as to why
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.240]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex would be involved
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.720]   in tenacity and willpower.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.280]   But no single anatomical or physiological
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.520]   or lesion-based finding is as compelling
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.600]   as when we consider all of the results
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.200]   about the anterior mid-singulate cortex together
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.580]   and side by side.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:23.120]   So for instance, recordings by neural imaging
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.560]   of the anterior mid-singulate cortex in an unbiased way,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.400]   meaning people are put into a brain scanner
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.920]   and brain activity is examined en masse,
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.520]   all of the brain areas are looked at,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.480]   and people are presented with either a hard task
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.000]   or an easy task, revealed that the anterior mid-singulate
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.940]   cortex shows elevated levels of activity
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.140]   in the hard versus the easy task.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.000]   And again, I want to point out that the researchers
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.400]   were not looking for that result,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.400]   they simply observed that result.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.640]   In addition, if people who exhibit high levels
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.560]   of academic performance across many different subjects
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.120]   are put into a brain scanner that evaluates
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.160]   so-called resting state connectivity, so no task,
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.520]   but simply levels of activity in different brain areas
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.460]   that occur spontaneously, so they're just sitting
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.240]   in the scanner looking at a blank screen,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.820]   the resting or spontaneous levels of activity
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.600]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.520]   of high-achieving individuals is higher
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.680]   relative to those of lower-achieving individuals.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.600]   In addition, people that have lesions or disruptions
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.480]   of anterior mid-singulate cortical function
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.800]   show increased apathy and depression and reduce levels
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.200]   of tenacity and motivation across the board,
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.840]   regardless of what domain of life one is asking about,
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.760]   whether or not it's athletic or academic, et cetera.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.240]   Indeed, successful dieters show elevated, spontaneous,
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.600]   and what's called evoked levels of activity
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.480]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.240]   So spontaneous, again, just at rest,
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.080]   they have higher levels of activity
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.120]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.480]   And for those that are presented with food
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.840]   and they have to resist that food,
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.760]   and they have to resist the smell of that food
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.340]   and the potential taste of that food,
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.320]   the activity of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.380]   goes up even further, especially in those individuals
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.240]   who can resist, that is, who can engage willpower
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.400]   to not eat the delicious food item.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.520]   Conversely, individuals that have failed
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.040]   to exert sufficient willpower to lose their desired weight,
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.080]   and this was for medical reasons related
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.780]   to trying to achieve medical health,
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.960]   as well as people who are obese
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.520]   seem to have diminished levels of activity
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.740]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.320]   In addition, people who are depressed,
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.520]   who express a lot of apathy,
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.740]   and here we're talking about clinically diagnosed
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.240]   major depression, show reduced levels of activity
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.440]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.000]   Humans that express a lot of what's called
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.760]   learned helplessness, that is, they've adopted the belief
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.640]   and the actions associated with the belief
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   that no matter what they do,
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.820]   the outcomes are not going to be what they desire,
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.540]   express lower levels of neural activity
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.780]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.520]   So you can see this list goes on and on,
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.680]   but it in fact gets even more interesting.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.720]   Remember earlier, I mentioned that successful dieters
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.600]   have elevated levels of neural activity
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.920]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.500]   Now that might seem like a good thing,
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.420]   and indeed it can be a good thing,
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.280]   but there's a pathologic condition associated with dieting
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.760]   and one's ability to engage willpower and resist food,
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.480]   and that's in the case of eating disorders
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.640]   such as anorexia nervosa.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.920]   Now I've done a Huberman Lab podcast solo episode
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.680]   about anorexia nervosa,
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.080]   and on that podcast I made the point
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:32.960]   that I'll make again now,
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.440]   which is that anorexia nervosa is the most deadly
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.380]   of all the psychiatric conditions,
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.960]   leading to death in a very large percentage
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.200]   of people that have it.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   Now, fortunately, there are treatments
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.020]   and more emerging all the time,
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.920]   but it's a very serious psychological
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.860]   and physiological condition that is extremely deadly.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.200]   Individuals with anorexia nervosa
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.360]   exhibit heightened levels of activity
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.160]   in their anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.600]   both at rest and when presented with food.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.080]   And I don't want to go on a full tangent about anorexia
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.660]   because we covered anorexia
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.520]   on the previous podcast episode about anorexia,
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.420]   which by the way, you can find at HubermanLab.com,
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.100]   simply search anorexia or eating disorders
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.740]   within the search function.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.600]   But one of the clear symptoms of anorexia nervosa
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.080]   is that the reward pathways of the brain,
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.240]   which we know feed into, that is send direct connections
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.380]   to the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.700]   seem to be activated under conditions
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.740]   in which people with anorexia avoid food
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.080]   as opposed to eat food.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.840]   And then there's a very interesting and positive literature
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.960]   about so-called super-agers.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.800]   So what we know for sure is that as people age,
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.600]   in particular between the ages of 60 and 90,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.440]   there's a reduction in the size of many brain areas,
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.400]   but the anterior mid-singulate cortex in particular,
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.360]   unless certain things are done to offset that,
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.200]   we are going to talk about
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.180]   what those particular things are in just a few minutes.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.000]   But there's a particular category of humans
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.400]   that's alive now and that live a very long time.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.200]   These are the people that stand the greatest chance
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.040]   of becoming centenarians and many of them are centenarians,
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.620]   so-called super-agers,
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:15.360]   but also within the category of super-agers
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.080]   are people who are 60 years old or more,
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.600]   because not all of them have reached 80, 90 yet,
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.560]   and have the cognition of 40-year-olds, 30-year-olds,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.520]   and often even of people in their mid-20s.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.260]   Now, there are a lot of things that are different
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.480]   about these super-agers.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.520]   Super-agers in the sense that they are maintaining
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.200]   very youthful levels of cognition.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.260]   But one of the things that's become very apparent
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.280]   from the neuroimaging data
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.680]   is that super-agers maintain a volume,
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.320]   a size of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.960]   that is significantly greater than their age-matched cohorts.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.780]   So the exciting thing is that there are many,
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.080]   many lines of evidence pointing to the fact
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.560]   that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.840]   at least has something to do with our ability
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.080]   to generate tenacity and willpower,
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:07.660]   and that it, when active, moves us up that continuum
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.000]   away from apathy and depression
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.820]   toward states of being able to engage in
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.280]   or resist particular types of behaviors.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.880]   So what I just described is a bunch of neuroimaging,
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.880]   structural volume data, blood uptake data, lesion studies,
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.140]   and so on and so forth.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:28.560]   But we can simplify all of that and, in fact,
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.040]   address something that perhaps I should have said earlier,
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.200]   which is that when we're talking about tenacity
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.360]   and willpower, we're really talking about
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.480]   one of two things.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.000]   We are either talking about that sense within us
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.880]   that has us saying, "I will, no matter what you tell me,
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.580]   no matter what you put in front of me,
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:50.820]   no matter what is rolled my way, I will blank."
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.760]   Now, the other expression of tenacity and willpower
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:59.200]   is that within us, within you, within me,
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.240]   when tenacity and willpower are active,
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.140]   we have that sense within us, that feeling in our body
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:10.560]   and that thought pattern, AKA feeling in our brain,
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.400]   that no matter what you say, no matter what you do,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.600]   no matter what you put in front of me, I won't.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.480]   So really willpower is either an expression of I will,
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.100]   or I absolutely will, is perhaps a better way to state it,
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.600]   or I absolutely won't.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.200]   Now, that might seem like just a simple,
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.320]   subjective reordering of a bunch of physiological data
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.000]   and psychology studies, but it's not.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.420]   It's actually far more important for us to understand this
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:42.420]   I absolutely will and I absolutely won't aspect of willpower
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.160]   because if indeed there is a single brain area
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.700]   that can govern willpower, and willpower is not one,
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.880]   but is at least two things, the sense of I absolutely will,
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.960]   no matter what you say, do, et cetera,
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.280]   or I absolutely won't, no matter what you say, do, et cetera,
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.660]   well, then this brain area can't be a simple switch.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.480]   It can't be willpower on, willpower off,
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.240]   willpower on, willpower off.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.300]   It can't be absolute, as we say.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.660]   It must be graded.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:14.840]   It must have levels.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.740]   So it's more like a slider on a light switch
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.700]   than an on versus off light switch.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.440]   In addition to that, if there is truly one brain area
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.700]   that plays a critical role in generating tenacity
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:31.120]   and willpower, and tenacity and willpower
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   is something that's required from us
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.680]   in a lot of different contexts where we have to say,
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.320]   I absolutely will, yes, this.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.840]   I absolutely won't, no, that.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.580]   I absolutely will also, yes, this, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.600]   because life is complex.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.260]   Even just the simple thing of say dieting
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.380]   or trying to get a particular degree
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.940]   or trying to navigate even a simple illness,
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.460]   like I'm going to get through this week
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.600]   despite feeling lousy.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.900]   I'm going to take good care of myself.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.460]   All of these things in some sense
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.180]   require tenacity and willpower.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.780]   And the behaviors we need to engage in
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.680]   and avoid engaging in is very dynamic,
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.580]   depending not just on who we are
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.980]   and what we're trying to do or not do,
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.640]   but also where we are that day, that moment.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.200]   Well, that means that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.980]   also needs access to information about context.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.300]   It needs to understand what's rewarding or non-rewarding
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.020]   in the context of what we're trying to accomplish,
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.100]   not just what feels good in the moment.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.500]   Now, fortunately, there've been a number of studies
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.420]   exploring not just the activity levels
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.940]   of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.460]   or the size of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.040]   and the various conditions we talked about before,
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.780]   depression, obesity, successful dieters,
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.580]   successful students, successful athletes, et cetera,
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.140]   but a lot of anatomical tracing studies,
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.800]   both from fixed, that is from dead brain tissue,
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.460]   so post-mortem brain tissue in humans,
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:56.100]   but also nowadays there are certain types of neuroimaging,
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.160]   particularly something called diffusion tensor imaging
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.820]   that allows one to examine the flow of information
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.420]   in and out of different brain areas
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.020]   through so-called white matter tracts.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.860]   Tracks, meaning T-R-A-C-T-S, tracts.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.520]   So these are the wires that connect neurons
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.440]   are called axons, and those axons are in sheaths
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.200]   with a fatty substance called myelin,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.240]   and that in sheathment with myelin allows them
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.820]   to transmit information very quickly.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.200]   You'll see where I'm going with all this in just a moment.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.080]   And what we know is that the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.320]   again, of which you have one on each side of the brain,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.480]   about a third of the way back from your forehead
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.100]   to the back of your brain, approximately,
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.640]   right above the so-called corpus callosum,
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.460]   this very robust collection of white matter tracts
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.100]   that connects the two sides of the brain,
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.200]   well, it gets input and sends input
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.760]   to a number of different brain areas,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.220]   including but not limited to the following.
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:52.880]   Autonomic centers that control, for instance,
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.120]   cardiovascular function,
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.340]   increases or decreases in heart rate.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.320]   Respiration, how fast and how deeply you breathe,
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.920]   or how shallowly and slowly you breathe.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.800]   Immune system, inputs and outputs with the spleen,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.340]   not directly, but through a couple of different stations
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.480]   with the very organs in your body
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.900]   that can release B cells and T cells,
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.660]   and immune molecules that can combat bacterial, viral,
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.380]   and fungal infections, and that can repair physical wounds.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.140]   And it communicates with the endocrine system,
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:25.540]   with the systems of the brain and body that release,
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.100]   for instance, estrogen and testosterone,
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.820]   which by the way, are present in both males and females.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.140]   And on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.520]   with Robert Sapolsky as my guest,
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.040]   we talked about, for instance, the role of testosterone,
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.020]   and many people think,
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.140]   oh, testosterone is all about aggression,
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.280]   testosterone is all about attack,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.600]   testosterone is all about mating,
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.640]   that is completely false.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.480]   While it can be involved in those different processes,
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.100]   what Dr. Sapolsky and I discussed
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.660]   is that one of the major functions of testosterone
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.780]   in the brain is to make effort feel good.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.920]   And you can see, and we'll talk a little bit more
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.580]   about how that links up very directly
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.980]   with this concept of tenacity and willpower.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.900]   So the first point is that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:10.020]   is in direct communication
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.940]   with all of the areas of the brain
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.620]   and through a couple of other stations, the body,
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.420]   that modulate our sense of tenacity and willpower,
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.740]   which we talked about earlier, the need for sleep,
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:25.900]   the need for pain or lack of pain,
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.020]   or emotional comfort or discomfort
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.340]   to modulate our level of tenacity and willpower.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.620]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.300]   is also directly linked up with premotor centers.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.800]   These are the centers of the brain
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.720]   that organize particular patterns of behavior,
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.160]   and indeed that can suppress particular patterns of behavior.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.220]   As I tell you that, you're probably filling in the blanks.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.920]   This is engaging in a behavior or resisting a behavior.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.060]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex is also directly wired in
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.840]   with the reward pathways of the brain.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.400]   It can trigger the release of dopamine.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.340]   It can also respond to the release of dopamine,
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.500]   and that dopamine release could be generated behaviorally.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.220]   It could be generated through some sort of food reward.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.840]   It could be pharmacologic.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.900]   There are a number of different ways
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.620]   that the dopamine system can communicate
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.580]   with the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.300]   The point here is that it is in direct communication
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.100]   with the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.960]   and the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.620]   is in direct communication with the dopamine system.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.300]   And what I just gave you is, frankly,
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.920]   just a partial list of the different areas of the brain
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.300]   that are communicating robustly
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.300]   with the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.140]   It gets information about interoception,
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.180]   our readout of how we feel in our body.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.700]   It also has robust inputs and outputs
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.060]   with the areas of the brain
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.780]   that are associated with exteroception,
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:42.040]   our perception of what is out around us.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.900]   So all of that provides a logical basis
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.460]   for the neuroimaging data, the lesion data,
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.940]   the volumetric data that we talked about a few minutes ago
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.820]   in the context of depression, anxiety,
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.900]   high performance, anorexia, and so on.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.540]   But one of the most important arguments
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.380]   that's ever been made
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.700]   in favor of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:04.620]   being a major seat for tenacity and willpower
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.780]   comes from Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.220]   who is soon to be a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.180]   We've actually recorded that episode already,
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.100]   and it should be out very soon.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:16.300]   Lisa's laboratory is well-known for pioneering research
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.200]   on emotion and affect.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.060]   I strongly encourage you to listen to that episode
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.500]   once it comes out.
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.220]   And it was actually Lisa herself
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.340]   that cued me to the importance
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.180]   of the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.140]   And Lisa and colleagues
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.780]   have written several spectacular reviews
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.740]   about the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.780]   and its role in tenacity and motivation.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.940]   I will provide links to a few of those
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.780]   in the show note captions.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:40.660]   The one that I'm particularly excited about,
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.280]   the one that I've spent now an immense amount of time with
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.900]   is entitled "The Tenacious Brain,
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.700]   How the Anterior Mid-singulate Cortex
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.620]   Contributes to Achieving Goals."
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.500]   So if you have a background in biology,
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.420]   even if you don't,
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.660]   I think you'll find that review to be very interesting.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.260]   And it further substantiates
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.300]   a lot of the points that I made a few moments ago
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.960]   about the different scenarios and types of individuals
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.160]   that seem to be able to engage
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.060]   their anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.260]   under different conditions
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.780]   and to a greater or lesser extent than others.
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.340]   So hats off to Lisa for cuing me
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.120]   to this incredibly interesting brain structure.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.180]   I had known that it existed,
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:15.580]   after all I teach neuroanatomy,
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.300]   to medical students at Stanford,
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.680]   and I taught neuroanatomy for many, many years,
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.860]   but I don't think enough people,
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.760]   and indeed very few professional neuroscientists
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.100]   could tell you what the anterior mid-singulate cortex does,
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.660]   but it has this apparently incredible function
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.100]   in generating tenacity and motivation.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:30.940]   Along those lines,
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.540]   one of the most incredible and important studies
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.300]   about the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.060]   and its capacity to generate
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.540]   feelings of tenacity and willpower
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:43.020]   comes from one of my colleagues at Stanford, Joe Parvizi,
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.540]   who essentially went into human beings
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.300]   who needed brain surgery for other reasons
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.780]   and stimulated particular brain areas
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.580]   with a very high degree of precision.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.180]   The title of the paper that I'm referring to
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.380]   was published in 2013 in the journal Neuron,
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.020]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.960]   and it's entitled "The Will to Persevere
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.640]   Induced by Electrical Stimulation
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.540]   of the Human Singulate Gyrus."
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.980]   Now you'll notice the title said human singulate gyrus,
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.220]   not anterior mid-singulate gyrus,
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.760]   but because they had electrodes
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.740]   and a stimulation technique that would allow them
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.720]   to stimulate in very small regions,
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.900]   extending as little as five millimeters,
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.360]   but no more, away from the stimulation site,
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.980]   they were able to march their stimulation
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:32.240]   around different subregions of the singulate gyrus of humans
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.420]   while those people were awake,
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.300]   and then ask those people, "How do you feel?
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.100]   What are you experiencing in this moment?"
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.960]   In addition to that, they were recording
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.980]   various autonomic parameters from those people,
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.960]   so heart rate, breathing,
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.140]   in addition to brainwave activity.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.420]   So what the subjects report
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.680]   when their anterior mid-singulate cortex was stimulated
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.540]   is that, in their words, something was about to happen.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.640]   They felt as if there was some sort of pressure upon them
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   from the outside, not physical pressure,
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.060]   but that something was about to happen.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.180]   In fact, one of the subjects described the sensation as,
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.800]   "It's as if there's a storm off in the distance,
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.560]   but I know I need to go into the storm,
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.400]   and I know I can make it through the storm."
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.720]   Another subject described the experience
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.760]   of having their anterior mid-singulate cortex stimulated
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   as, "Okay, something not necessarily good is going to happen,
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   but I know that I need to marshal resources and resist,
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.040]   and I'm confident that I can push through."
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.200]   Now, because Parvizi and colleagues are excellent scientists,
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.800]   they, of course, did control experiments
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.820]   where they would tell the person,
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.240]   "Okay, we're stimulating that same brain area
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.080]   that a moment ago you told me created this feeling
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.940]   of some pressure upon you that you have to resist,
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.440]   some sense of fight or urgency to push back."
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.720]   But in reality, during certain control conditions,
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.000]   they were not stimulating those brain areas,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.400]   and the subjects then reported,
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.580]   "Mm, I don't feel like anything's about to happen.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.560]   Yeah, I don't feel anything at all."
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.720]   In other words, it was the stimulation
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.280]   of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.240]   and only the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.160]   that created the sensation within people
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.560]   that there was something to resist,
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.560]   that there was something putting pressure on them,
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.960]   again, not physical pressure, but psychological pressure,
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.520]   and that they were going to have to marshal resources
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.560]   in order to push back upon.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.880]   In fact, they reported feeling as if
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.240]   their body was getting ready to do something.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.620]   One subject said something along the lines of,
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.200]   "I feel like I'm about to do something.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.140]   I'm about to go someplace or do something
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.680]   to resist this foreboding sense that's now coming over me."
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.620]   So this is very interesting, and of course,
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.840]   is in line with all of the data that we discussed before
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.680]   about neural activity patterns, both spontaneous and evoked,
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.360]   about brain volume changes
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.520]   and the anterior mid-singulate cortex, so on and so forth.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.360]   And it really points to the idea
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.640]   that the anterior mid-singulate cortex is a hub,
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.220]   a hub that receives information
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.080]   from a diversity of brain areas
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.480]   that we talked about a few minutes ago,
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.920]   and that generates a particular sense within us
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.520]   that we are going to be forward center of mass,
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.220]   that we are going to resist something,
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.820]   and that perhaps we are going to move or act
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:10.760]   in some particular way, or,
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.280]   as we've been discussing all along,
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.420]   resist action in some particular way,
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.500]   but that it requires that we marshal resources,
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.240]   which takes us back, of course,
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.000]   to the studies of Baumeister and indeed of Dweck,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.220]   where they explored willpower as a limited resource,
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.740]   perhaps glucose, perhaps as that limited resource.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:32.740]   Beliefs about willpower and glucose,
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.020]   probably with a high degree of certainty,
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.580]   are going to be involved there too.
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.500]   But regardless of that controversy,
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.300]   it's clear that there's an energy required.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:46.040]   There's an activation state of engagement or resistance
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.520]   to a particular behavior or thought pattern
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.280]   that we all associate
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.920]   with this phenomenon of tenacity and willpower.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.980]   And in a kind of miraculous way,
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:59.100]   as a neuroscientist, we're generally taught nowadays
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:02.380]   that individual brain areas don't really trigger
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:04.360]   individual functions and perceptions of the brain.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.620]   There are a few exceptions to that.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.220]   You know, you have a fusiform face area
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.960]   that really does seem to be involved
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.160]   in the perception of faces.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.900]   And when lesioned, you can't recognize faces.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.060]   But outside of just a few limited contexts,
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.300]   it's very rare that one comes across a literature
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:23.240]   that across all of the studies involved
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.500]   point to a single brain structure and its networks
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.340]   as giving rise to something as complex
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.400]   and flexible as tenacity and willpower.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.100]   But in the case of the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.340]   it really does seem to meet those criteria
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:40.200]   as the brain hub responsible for tenacity and willpower.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.360]   Now, a key idea that Dr. Feldman Barrett has contributed
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.940]   to studies of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.920]   as a structure that helps us generate
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.420]   what we call tenacity and willpower
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.580]   to help us achieve different types of goals
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.040]   is this idea of allostasis.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.060]   Most of you have perhaps heard of homeostasis,
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.720]   which is the idea that all of our cells, all of our organs,
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.440]   indeed our entire body and psychology
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.200]   are always seeking homeostasis,
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.740]   the perfect balance of sleep and activity,
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:14.740]   of food and burning fuels, of oxygen and carbon dioxide,
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.000]   and so on and so forth.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.180]   And while homeostasis certainly exists
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.280]   and is a valid phenomenon,
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.960]   there's also a concept that we hear far less about,
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.300]   but that is equally important,
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.420]   which is the concept of allostasis.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:29.140]   Allostasis is the idea that much of what our brain
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.940]   and body need to do, but especially our brain,
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.260]   is to allocate, right, allostasis,
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.260]   to allocate resources to particular functions
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.980]   depending on our motivational goals
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:41.060]   and the challenges upon us.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.860]   And in every way, what we understand about the structure
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.640]   and function of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.900]   is that it is doing just that.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.160]   It is deciding how much glucose
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.880]   should a given brain area consume,
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.200]   perhaps a brain area that's involved in visual perception
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.700]   because you're involved in a motivational task
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.260]   where in order to succeed,
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.200]   you need to pay careful visual attention
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.040]   to particular things.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.860]   Or you're involved in a task
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.080]   where you have to listen to particular things.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.460]   Or perhaps you are involved in a physical foot race
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.660]   where you don't want to allocate a lot of energy
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:15.420]   towards thinking about your stride or your step,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.620]   unless that's necessary,
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.700]   and you actually want to shut down your brain activity
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.580]   as much as possible,
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.960]   except for the brain areas that are required
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.280]   to get you to continue to run.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.460]   In that sense, the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:31.960]   as a sort of a dial on how much fuel is consumed,
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.460]   not by the brain and body as a whole,
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:37.300]   but by individual brain and body parts,
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.640]   meets all the criteria of what you would want
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.700]   for a brain area that controls things
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.940]   like tenacity and willpower.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.460]   Because even for those individuals
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.740]   who seem to just have an endless supply
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.640]   of tenacity and willpower,
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.280]   they too have to go into habitual behavior.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.920]   They can't simply lean into every aspect of life
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.640]   with the kind of resistance from outside
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.040]   and the resistance against those outside forces,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.140]   or even resistance to internal forces,
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.120]   voices in their head, et cetera, on a constant basis.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.480]   They still need to sleep.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.460]   They still need to be functional
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.900]   in that expression of tenacity and willpower.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.000]   They need to be able to strategy switch,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.840]   and they need to be able to come off the gas, as we say.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.280]   Not because tenacity and willpower
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.480]   are necessarily a limited resource,
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.020]   but because for so many aspects of life,
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.640]   engaging tenacity and willpower is not advantageous.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.520]   Hence the example I gave earlier about eating disorders,
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.220]   where an apparently hardwired function of our brain
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.620]   to be able to generate some sort of reward
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:40.260]   for resisting a given behavior goes too far
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.480]   and then can actually threaten one's own health
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.320]   or even life.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.940]   So the concept of allostatic load, allostatic balance,
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.080]   and allostatic function is something that we get into
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.620]   in a fair amount of detail in the discussion
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.660]   with Dr. Feldman Barrett in that episode,
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.960]   which is coming out soon.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.220]   But in the meantime,
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.640]   if you were to think about the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.600]   as having a single function,
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.420]   the function that Dr. Feldman Barrett has ascribed to it
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:04.840]   as controlling how much energy different brain
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   and body areas should get in a given context,
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.400]   well, that makes a lot of sense to me.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.940]   And I think it's the one that best describes
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.160]   all of the functional data, indeed includes or jives
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.040]   with all the anatomical data
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.500]   about the anterior mid-singulate cortex as well.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.760]   One of the really important twists in all of this
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.140]   is that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:28.440]   is not just sitting there to allocate
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.560]   and dole out different amounts of energy
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.680]   and activation to different brain areas.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.760]   It is also receiving input from both the brain and body.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.760]   And in sort of a beautiful twist on the whole story
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.040]   of what the anterior mid-singulate cortex does,
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.420]   we know that when we move our body,
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.920]   we are activating the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.200]   And we know that when we move our body,
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.880]   because we in some way forced ourselves
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.600]   or encouraged ourselves to do it,
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.960]   we activate the anterior mid-singulate cortex more.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.520]   Similarly, and because the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.500]   is so flexible in the different contexts
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.980]   in which it can be activated,
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:09.820]   if we are simply reading or we are listening to something
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:10.800]   that we're supposed to learn
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.620]   or trying to learn a piece of music
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.120]   or trying to do anything for that matter,
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:18.700]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex, yes, will be activated,
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.700]   but that its levels of activation are far greater
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.100]   when we experience a lot of resistance
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.260]   that we have to overcome.
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.820]   Remember the earlier result, and by the way,
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.060]   I'll provide a link in the show note captions
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.940]   to this particular study or set of studies.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:33.420]   There are about two, one really spectacular one
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.300]   and a couple of others
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.020]   that tangentially points to the same finding,
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.340]   that when people engage in a hard task, not an easy task,
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.500]   but a hard task,
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.760]   that the anterior mid-singulate cortex activity is elevated.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.140]   So the way to think about the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.740]   is that it's not just sitting there as a hub
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.780]   that you reach into and activate,
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.080]   it's also receiving inputs that can activate it.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.400]   And that's what allows us to now talk about the tools
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.460]   and protocols that don't just allow us
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.320]   to engage our anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.880]   and access more tenacity and willpower,
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.540]   but that allow us to exercise,
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:14.000]   not necessarily in the context of physical exercise,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.200]   although it could be that too,
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.620]   but to exercise our anterior mid-singulate cortices ability
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:22.180]   to engage not just in that challenging context,
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:24.300]   but in other challenging contexts as well.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.020]   In fact, I'll just tell you right now
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.940]   that studies in non-human primates
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.560]   and to a limited extent in humans,
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.380]   but here we think there's a strong analog
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.260]   between the non-human primate data and the human data.
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.220]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex is chock-a-block
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.420]   full of the expression of molecules such as chemkinase II,
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:45.000]   receptors to various neurotrophins,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.660]   particular types of NMDA and methyl deaspartate receptors,
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:52.280]   all of which, if none of those names mean anything to you,
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.640]   just know that all of them refer to different aspects of,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.460]   and a capacity for synaptic plasticity,
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.080]   which is the ability for connections in the brain to change.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.300]   They can get stronger,
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.080]   you can actually grow new connections.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.600]   In other words, the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.100]   can be built up as a structure
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.920]   to engage tenacity and willpower
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.320]   by activating it through one or a limited number
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.620]   of different types of behaviors,
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.360]   meaning engagement in behaviors
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.020]   that frankly we would rather not engage in,
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.200]   as well as not engaging in behaviors
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.980]   that reflexively we really want to,
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.060]   that we're sort of drawn to engage in.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:31.020]   Both of those contexts, the I absolutely will,
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:32.720]   even though frankly I don't want to,
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.060]   or you're telling me I can't,
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.020]   as well as the I absolutely won't,
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.900]   even though you're tempting me to do that,
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.060]   or that's tempting me to do that,
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:41.440]   or even I'm tempted to do that,
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.480]   that buildup of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.300]   has extensive carryover into other domains of life
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.340]   because it's the same structure
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.620]   that is then used for other types of behaviors
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:55.420]   and learning that require tenacity and willpower.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:56.900]   So that's incredibly reassuring.
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.260]   In fact, it's downright exciting
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:01.500]   because as I mentioned earlier,
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500]   while there are a near infinite number
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.580]   of different circumstances
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:07.460]   where we each and all need tenacity and willpower,
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:10.020]   it seems that there's a very generic mechanism
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.720]   for generating tenacity and willpower.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.220]   And that means that if we can build up our capacity
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:17.360]   for tenacity and willpower
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.320]   by engaging particular types of behaviors
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.900]   and resisting particular types of behaviors,
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:25.460]   well, then it's going to carry over in a very functional way
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.340]   to the other aspects of life that we find challenging
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.740]   and that we may find challenging in the future.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.800]   Okay, so by now, I like to think that I've convinced you,
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.180]   because frankly, the data are very convincing,
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.760]   that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.980]   is a vital hub within your brain
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:42.280]   for allocating energy and resources
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.100]   to generating tenacity and willpower.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.820]   And perhaps it's taken you a lot of tenacity and willpower
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.760]   to get this far through the episode,
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.860]   waiting with bated breath,
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:54.880]   presumably to learn how exactly you can improve
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.580]   the functioning of your anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.200]   Now, fortunately, there are published peer-reviewed data
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.020]   that explain how to do that.
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.880]   In fact, there's a study that was published in 2006
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.720]   by Colum and colleagues,
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.060]   entitled "aerobic exercise training increases brain volume
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:12.640]   in aging humans."
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.720]   And before you go run off, literally,
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.780]   and engage in cardiovascular exercise,
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.760]   I'm just going to describe to you the contour of this study
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.720]   and what specifically was done
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.740]   so that you can best implement the best protocols
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.080]   for your particular circumstances.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:32.080]   This was a study exploring why and how
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.660]   certain brain areas and brain volume
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.760]   generally decreases as we age.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.500]   It's well known, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.400]   that individuals aged really 50 and older,
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.280]   and maybe as early as 30 and older,
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.540]   experience a decrease in brain volume
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.440]   with particular brain areas shrinking faster than others.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.520]   But of course, there are other people
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.220]   that include the super-agers that we talked about earlier,
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.520]   and many, many other people who are not super-agers
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.780]   who don't experience the same decrease in brain volume.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:02.260]   So why is it that they maintain the same brain size
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.340]   that they did when they were younger,
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.860]   or undergo less decrease in brain size?
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.660]   That's what the researchers for this study
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.240]   were initially interested in understanding,
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.500]   and they did come to some really interesting conclusions
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.900]   about that, but they also came to some interesting
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.760]   conclusions that relate to today's discussion
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.120]   on tenacity and willpower.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.040]   This study involved having individuals
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.640]   who were 60 to 79 years old,
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.360]   divided into one of two groups.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.400]   One group did cardiovascular exercise,
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.580]   the other group did more calisthenics/
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:34.380]   stretching type exercise.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:38.840]   Both groups did one hour of exercise three times per week.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.500]   The group that did cardiovascular training
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.400]   initially started off by doing,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.140]   and by the way, they just simply called it aerobic training,
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:49.380]   but this could be rowing on the rower,
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.140]   this could be running, this could be cycling.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.060]   I think for sake of understanding
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.980]   application of tools and protocols,
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.100]   you would want to pick any kind of activity
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.800]   that you could do consistently without injuring yourself.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.800]   That's what's really important.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.360]   And that gets your heart rate elevated.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.760]   They started off these individuals
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:10.300]   with relatively low intensity cardiovascular exercise
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:14.160]   for that hour, getting their heart rate up to about 50%
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:16.080]   of their maximum heart rate,
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.560]   but very quickly had those individuals
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.640]   increase the intensity
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.140]   of those cardiovascular training sessions.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.720]   So they were doing, again, three one hour sessions per week,
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.900]   getting their heart rate up to about 75%
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.180]   of their maximum heart rate.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:31.160]   Sometimes a little less, 60%, sometimes a little bit more,
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.760]   but in that general range.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.340]   So for those of you that think about
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.020]   different zones of cardio,
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.180]   this is probably in the area of zone three,
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:42.060]   not quite zone two cardio, maybe zone three cardio,
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:45.900]   so where one can not carry out a conversation very easily,
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.920]   but where one is not completely gasping for air
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:51.820]   as one would if they went to their maximum heart rate
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:52.860]   or near maximum heart rate.
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.880]   Okay, so three one hour episodes
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.820]   of cardiovascular training per week
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.340]   at a moderately high intensity.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:02.400]   The other group simply doing calisthenics and stretching
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.680]   for the equivalent amount of time.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.160]   And they had another group within the study
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.200]   that were much younger
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.520]   that did similar activities or no activity
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.460]   simply as a control for the brain imaging data.
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.640]   Now I'm summarizing the study with a fairly broad brush,
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:18.060]   both for sake of time,
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.340]   and of course I'll provide a link
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:21.440]   to the study in the show no captions
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:24.100]   so you can access it and peruse in more detail if you like,
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:26.460]   but I wouldn't be talking about this study
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:29.260]   if it were simply a study about cardiovascular training
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.660]   and brain volume.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.540]   I'm talking about this study
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:35.420]   because the specific brain areas that maintained
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:37.780]   or in some cases increased in volume
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:40.660]   as a consequence of doing these three hours per week
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:45.260]   of moderate intensity cardiovascular training included,
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.900]   of course, the anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.640]   That was actually the primary location
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.020]   in which the maintenance of brain volume was observed.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:56.340]   And in some cases increases in brain volume were observed.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:57.820]   This is a group of people
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:01.860]   who normally would be losing volume size
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:03.860]   of their anterior mid cingulate cortex,
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.800]   but for which three hours a week
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.980]   of moderate intensity cardiovascular training
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.860]   maintained the volume,
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:11.980]   the size of that anterior mid cingulate cortex,
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.600]   and in some cases increased the volume,
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.780]   the size of anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:19.660]   And they also observed a maintenance or increase
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.300]   in the size of the anterior white matter tracts.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:25.460]   Remember T-R-A-C-T-S, I didn't spell that out before
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.220]   just to spell it out for fun,
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:30.180]   although that is the sort of thing that I would probably do.
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:34.220]   Those white matter tracts are the communication routes
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.780]   by which different brain areas communicate.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.780]   And this anterior white matter tract
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.180]   that maintained size in the people
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.460]   that did cardiovascular training,
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:45.200]   as compared to those that simply did
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.760]   the calisthenics training and stretching,
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.060]   is the very white matter tracts
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.920]   that connects the two sides of the brain,
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.300]   the frontal lobes,
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.120]   that allows the anterior mid cingulate cortex
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:55.960]   on one side of the brain
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.160]   and the anterior mid cingulate cortex
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.000]   on the other side of the brain,
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.340]   as well as other brain structures
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.060]   to communicate with one another.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.340]   So this is really spectacular.
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.980]   I mean, the authors of the study
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:07.980]   didn't embark on the study to find or even look for
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.300]   increases or maintenance
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.260]   in the volume of the anterior mid cingulate cortex
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.200]   and the communication routes
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.420]   in and out of the anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:18.500]   It just so happened that cardiovascular training
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.060]   done three times per week
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.220]   for an hour at a time at moderate intensity
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:25.740]   increased the size of the anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:27.840]   And as I mentioned, the white matter tracts,
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.760]   which allow information to go in and out
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.060]   of the anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.360]   Now, we should all be asking ourselves,
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.700]   why would that be the case?
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:37.420]   I mean, somebody gets on a stationary bike and pedals
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.560]   or goes out on a road bike or runs.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.580]   You know, is there something inherent
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:44.520]   to running or cycling or rowing or swimming
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.220]   or an aerobics class, dancing, et cetera,
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:48.640]   that gets the heart rate up
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.600]   that directly feeds into the anterior mid cingulate cortex?
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.580]   After all, is the anterior mid cingulate cortex
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:56.260]   responsible for generating the activity of running
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.200]   or cycling or swimming?
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.100]   No.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.640]   Rather, the interpretation is that in order to engage
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.060]   in this one hour, three times per week set of sessions
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.300]   of cardiovascular training, they had to allocate resources.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.760]   They had to get up out of a chair.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.860]   They had to get off the couch.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.920]   They had to say no to other potential obligations,
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.520]   social engagements, meals, et cetera,
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.740]   and get to these exercise classes or sessions
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.620]   that they did with others or alone.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:25.860]   Now, an interesting and in fact important aspect
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:27.760]   of the study is that the compliance
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.220]   with this three hours per week of cardiovascular training
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.060]   was very high.
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.680]   85% of individuals engaged in these sessions
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.600]   across the six month period of the study.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.920]   I should have mentioned that earlier.
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:41.340]   The study was carried out over the course of six months.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.220]   They did not have the opportunity to do neuroimaging
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.140]   after say a week or two weeks.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.000]   So they imaged these people's brains before
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.140]   and they imaged these people's brains
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:51.820]   after the six month period.
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.280]   It's anybody's guess as to whether or not
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.360]   they would have observed the same
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.060]   or maybe even greater increases
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.620]   at the one month interval, et cetera.
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.220]   We simply don't know.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.580]   There's a great cost, both energetic and financial
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.040]   to doing these kinds of studies.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.800]   So they looked at a six month period.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.980]   But setting all of that aside,
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.440]   this is a very important study
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.000]   in the context of today's discussion.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.880]   Because what it means is that if we acknowledge
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.440]   that the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.420]   and the volume of anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:21.060]   is related to one's ability to generate tenacity
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:24.700]   and willpower for any number of different endeavors,
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.920]   well, then having access to a tool or a protocol
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.860]   that can increase the size
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:31.920]   of one's anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.200]   is going to be extremely valuable.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.900]   So what's the takeaway from this study?
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.980]   The takeaway from the study is not necessarily
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:40.620]   that you should be doing three one hour bouts
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.620]   of cardiovascular training per week for six months
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.220]   to maintain or increase the size
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.800]   of your anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.240]   I do think that's the case
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.620]   if you're not already doing sufficient amounts
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.680]   of cardiovascular training.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.760]   And what constitutes sufficient amounts?
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.760]   Well, I think there's general agreement now,
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.160]   both between the material that I've covered
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.700]   in our foundational fitness protocol
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.460]   and in the series on exercise physiology
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.500]   with Dr. Andy Galpin
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.060]   and in various discussions with Dr. Peter Attia.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.100]   The general agreement is that everyone should be getting
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.500]   somewhere between 150 to 200 minutes
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.480]   of so-called zone two low intensity
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:15.660]   cardiovascular exercise per week.
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.660]   But the results of this study really point
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.700]   to the idea that we should all be doing perhaps three hours,
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.400]   but certainly we should all be doing some form
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.840]   of physical exercise.
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.180]   But for any of us that are interested
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:31.920]   in increasing tenacity and willpower across domains,
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:34.040]   both for cognitive and physical endeavors,
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.140]   emotional endeavors too, for that matter,
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.460]   that we should be engaging in some exercise.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.260]   And again, we're going to talk about cognitive exercise
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:43.840]   in a moment, but that we should be engaging
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.600]   in some exercise that we are not already doing.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.100]   Now that of course will lead many people to think, wait,
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:52.960]   I'm already doing 200 minutes per week of zone two cardio.
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.120]   How can I add three hours more of cardio?
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.060]   That's not what I'm saying.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.840]   What's important to understand about this whole discussion
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:01.720]   about tenacity and willpower is that the ability
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.300]   to engage the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:06.400]   and to build up its volume literally
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.720]   and increase its activity relies on one critical feature,
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.300]   which is that you have to be in some degree of resistance,
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:19.300]   some lack of desire, or I should say lack of reflexive desire
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:22.300]   or ability to engage in that behavior, okay?
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:24.440]   This is super important if you're thinking about tools
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.580]   and protocols to increase your level of tenacity
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:27.420]   and willpower.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:31.420]   If for instance, you love cold showers and ice baths,
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:36.100]   well then it's very unlikely that taking cold showers
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.580]   or getting into an ice bath is going to increase your level
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.080]   of tenacity and willpower further.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.800]   It might reinforce the tenacity and willpower
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.940]   that you've already built,
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:45.000]   but it's not going to increase it further.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.920]   You need to add something or subtract something
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.840]   that makes it harder, not easier,
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.680]   to engage in or resist a behavior.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.340]   Okay, I want to be really clear about this.
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.540]   In the study that I just described
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:55.000]   from Colom and colleagues,
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   they took individuals that were not exercising prior
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.720]   to the study, and those people had to therefore
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.000]   generate significant amounts of motivation
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.640]   in order to regularly engage in these three one-hour
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.960]   per week episodes of cardiovascular training, okay?
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.280]   Now, the fact that there was no comparable increase
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.160]   in the volume of the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.600]   or anterior white matter tracts in the group
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.440]   that did the calisthenics and stretching is also important
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.460]   because it implies that activities that are easier
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:28.680]   to carry out, that don't get the heart rate elevated as much,
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.280]   are not going to create changes in this brain structure
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.480]   that is associated with tenacity and willpower.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.720]   And there's a nice confirmation of that in the study,
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:40.820]   in fact, because they observed, as one would expect,
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:44.400]   a significant increase in VO2 max in the individuals
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.380]   that were assigned to the group
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.560]   that did cardiovascular training,
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.860]   but they did not observe a significant increase in VO2 max
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.820]   in the individuals that did three one-hour-per-week sessions
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.720]   of calisthenics and stretching across the six-month period.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.680]   Okay, so the important point here is
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:03.400]   if you're already doing, let's say, an hour a week
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.140]   of moderate to high-intensity cardiovascular training,
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:07.760]   or resistance training for that matter,
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.980]   you're going to need to add something
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:12.240]   in order to get further activation
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.520]   of this brain hub for tenacity and willpower.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.200]   And of course, the idea here,
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.360]   or else we wouldn't be talking about it,
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.440]   is that that activation and that increase in volume
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.720]   in the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.200]   would then be applicable to other endeavors,
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.080]   for instance, academics,
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.360]   or some aspect of your professional life
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.640]   or relationship life,
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.680]   that you can build up tenacity and willpower
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.900]   as a capacity within you,
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:39.280]   or we should say within your anterior mid-singulate cortices,
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.480]   but that the route to activating
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.960]   and increasing the robustness
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.360]   of your anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.400]   requires that you engage in something
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.560]   that you don't really want to do,
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.520]   and certainly not something
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.040]   that you're regularly engaging in already.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.200]   Remember, way back at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.060]   we compared willpower and tenacity to habit execution, right?
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:59.100]   Well, this is a simple case
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.720]   where if you're already doing something,
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.120]   simply continuing to do it
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.560]   might maintain what you've already got,
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.320]   but it's not going to further build up
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.160]   your tenacity and willpower.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.460]   So along those lines,
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.340]   I don't want you to simply take
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:14.080]   the three one-hour cardiovascular sessions per week protocol
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.640]   that they use within this study
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.440]   and expect it to increase your levels
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.640]   of tenacity and willpower,
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.440]   unless, of course, you're currently only doing one hour
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.720]   of cardiovascular training
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.960]   at moderate to high intensity per week,
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.760]   in which case increasing to two hours
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.380]   may very well increase your anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.740]   and overall level of tenacity and willpower,
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.240]   and certainly doing three hours per week
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:37.520]   would be expected to do it even further.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.920]   And I should mention that we can extrapolate from this study
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.580]   in a meaningful way, I think in a grounded way,
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.520]   that's related to mechanism and say,
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.940]   well, if you, for instance, like me,
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.380]   can't play a musical instrument
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:53.440]   or are not bilingual in language,
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.340]   that taking on the challenge,
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.340]   if indeed it's a challenge,
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:00.160]   and for me it would be a challenge perhaps for you as well,
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.140]   to learn an instrument as an adult
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:04.600]   or to learn a second or maybe a third language.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.620]   If that's challenging,
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:07.620]   and in fact that's something that you're resisting doing,
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:08.660]   well, then great.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:11.100]   It's going to provide an even greater opportunity
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:14.460]   to engage the activity of the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:17.580]   Remember that study that showed that hard tasks,
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.340]   hard challenges are what activate
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:20.720]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.260]   Easy challenges don't, okay?
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:26.020]   Habits that are reflexive simply do not.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.700]   So you have to pick something hard.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.980]   You have to pick something that's either physically
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:31.180]   and/or psychologically hard.
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:32.460]   And of course, we want to highlight the fact
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.300]   that you never want to engage in anything physical
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.460]   or cognitive, emotional, or otherwise
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:39.240]   that is psychologically or physically damaging to you, right?
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.580]   Because this is something that you're going to want
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:44.060]   to maintain or carry out for some period of time.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.160]   Now, along those lines,
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:50.700]   we could imagine a huge number of different protocols
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:51.860]   that one could engage in,
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:54.260]   but I think there are a couple of key things
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.660]   that extend across all of those opportunities.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.900]   First of all, it's clear now based on our understanding
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:04.060]   of the anatomical inputs to the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:06.040]   that while exercise is great,
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.220]   and certainly movement to the body
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.740]   when we don't want to move our body,
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:13.580]   AKA running, AKA weightlifting,
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.660]   AKA learning a new skill like dancing or gymnastics
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.260]   or something of that sort,
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:22.420]   is going to engage this hub for tenacity and willpower,
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.420]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:27.460]   But there are a number of other opportunities to do that.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.860]   And we can think of those in a kind of playful context,
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:31.500]   but one that is both playful
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.460]   and highly functional and applicable.
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:37.380]   So for instance, if you already resistance train
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:40.980]   and you're doing what we now generally agree as a field
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:44.380]   is the minimum of six hard working sets per muscle group
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:45.640]   per week in order to maintain
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.240]   or build muscle size and strength.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.700]   Some of you don't want to build muscle size,
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.700]   but everyone should be trying to maintain muscle strength.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.520]   There's a very high correlation,
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:57.460]   we now know, between muscle strength and cognitive function,
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:00.140]   especially as one gets past 40 years of age,
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.560]   but even younger.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.900]   So maintaining neuromuscular function and strength
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:05.780]   is very, very important,
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:07.240]   even if you don't want to increase muscle size,
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.060]   you can learn how to do that, by the way.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.660]   We have zero cost protocols,
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:12.940]   they're all listed out by going to hubramanelab.com,
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.840]   check out the series I did with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.760]   check out the key toolkit takeaways from that series,
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.760]   also available at hubramanelab.com,
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.480]   just put exercise protocols into the search function.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.000]   But let's say you're already resistance training,
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.840]   you're already doing cardiovascular training,
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.860]   what can you do to build up your tenacity and willpower
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:33.300]   for application in not just that endeavor,
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.340]   but other endeavors?
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:37.080]   Well, pick something that you don't want to do.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.620]   These are what I call, in a very non-scientific way,
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.080]   micro sucks.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:44.000]   These things suck, but they suck a little bit,
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.500]   and they're safe, right?
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.920]   You have to pick things that are safe for you,
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.460]   but they suck enough that they require some effort,
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:53.460]   they require getting over some friction,
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:56.320]   engaging in something that you don't reflexively want to do.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.860]   So for instance, that might be one extra set
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.480]   at the end of a round of three to five sets
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.500]   of a given exercise.
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.280]   Or it could be, for instance, 100 jumping jacks
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.080]   at the end of what you consider a hard run.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.380]   It could be, for instance,
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:12.080]   finishing out that language lesson
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.300]   and then deciding to do five minutes of sitting still,
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.280]   thinking about the material that you learned
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.000]   when you so desperately want to just jump on your phone.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.960]   Pick circumstances where the degree of resistance
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:26.200]   is very high, where the degree of impulse
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:28.960]   to do something else than the thing that you know
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.680]   you need to do is very high,
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.760]   and then start applying those on a regular basis.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.120]   It could be after every workout.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.340]   It could be in the middle of the workout.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:38.500]   For instance, some people have a really hard time
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:40.340]   not looking at their phone during a workout.
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:42.920]   I like to listen to podcasts or music during a workout,
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.120]   but I really try and resist text messaging
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.120]   and reading email and things of that sort while working out.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.640]   So the harder that becomes, the more I think about it
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.600]   and the more I resist it,
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.280]   the more presumably activation
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.120]   of the anterior mid-singulate cortex I'm getting
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.340]   and that you would get as well.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.600]   So these little micro sucks,
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.480]   like, ah, it sucks not to look at the phone right now.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:05.500]   It sucks to do 100 jumping jacks at the end of a run.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.340]   Of course, if you're excited
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:08.400]   due to the 100 jumping jacks at the end of the run,
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.320]   that's not going to be a good avenue into activating
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.520]   and increasing the volume
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.300]   of your anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.900]   Everything we've talked about up until now
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.240]   supports the statement I just made.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.020]   Easy tasks, desirable tasks, don't do it.
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:21.880]   It's the thing you don't want to do.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.600]   So imparting these little micro sucks can be very useful.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.200]   You'll have to think about what particular micro sucks
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:29.240]   you incorporate into your exercise routines,
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.960]   your cognitive routines, and your daily routines,
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.000]   and how often.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]   I don't think you need to go completely berserk on this,
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.660]   doing them all day long,
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:38.680]   but keep in mind that these are the sorts of behaviors
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:41.600]   and resistance of behaviors,
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.900]   because again, certain micro sucks might be,
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.320]   if you're somebody who practices intermittent fasting,
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:50.160]   we don't want to send you into the realm of eating disorder,
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.300]   but maybe you really do wait an extra 15 minutes
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.940]   before your usual first mealtime,
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.400]   which for me would really suck.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.340]   That might even move from micro suck into macro suck,
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:01.080]   'cause I like to eat when I'm hungry,
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.880]   but waiting a few extra minutes for no other reason
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.920]   than allowing oneself to activate
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:09.520]   that anterior mid-singulate cortex circuitry
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.600]   would be one way to try and build up
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.920]   one's tenacity and willpower.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.040]   So at some level, this should all seem pretty logical.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.960]   It actually doesn't even require a firm understanding
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:23.840]   of the underlying neuroscience for it to make sense, right?
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.560]   You want to do something, you resist doing it.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.300]   That's building up tenacity and willpower.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.940]   You don't really want to do something, you do it.
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:30.660]   That's building up tenacity and willpower.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:32.840]   Well, I do believe, in fact,
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.300]   there's a lot of data to support the fact
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.040]   that our understanding of the mechanisms
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.420]   underneath things like tenacity and willpower
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:44.800]   can be very advantageous when trying to carry out
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.400]   these different types of behaviors
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.120]   to increase tenacity and willpower.
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:49.040]   Why?
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.660]   Well, today we learned that there's a huge variety
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.040]   of contexts in which one can activate
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.280]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.480]   which means that it's not cardiovascular exercise per se.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:02.460]   It's not resisting the cookie per se, right?
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.380]   It's not waiting 15 more minutes to eat
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:07.880]   or making sure that you sit still
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.000]   and don't look at your phone at the end of a learning bout
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.960]   and really think about what you learned a little bit more.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.240]   Even though it really, really sucks to do that,
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.600]   it's really hard, it creates a lot of agitation.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.360]   It's not about any one of those protocols, if you will,
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.080]   per se, rather it's about deliberate engagement
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.880]   in the behaviors that we least want to do
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.620]   in a given moment.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:30.680]   Or if you're trying to build up willpower and tenacity
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.280]   to not engage in certain types of behaviors,
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:38.440]   it's about our ability to suppress behavioral action.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.120]   Now, I do want to highlight the potential hazards
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.860]   of this type of approach to building up tenacity
[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:45.400]   and willpower and indeed to life.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.740]   And we can call on the earlier example of eating disorders
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:51.220]   as a very salient one, right?
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:54.120]   There is a way in which all of this can run amok
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.380]   and we can get so heavily into stoicism,
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.000]   we can get so heavily into the idea
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.980]   of building up tenacity and willpower,
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:02.840]   that it takes us into realms that are unhealthy for us
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.440]   psychologically, emotionally, and or physically.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.120]   And that's certainly not the goal here.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.920]   And I certainly don't want to motivate
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.520]   that type of behavior or resistance of behavior.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.800]   We should all be seeking a relationship with life
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:17.640]   and with goals, et cetera.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.440]   That involves, yes, I believe some degree
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.240]   of activating tenacity and willpower,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.600]   really finding that fight within us
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:26.120]   that Parvizi and colleagues found
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:28.240]   when they stimulated the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:29.080]   of people, right?
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.300]   All of a sudden they're like, yeah, I'm driving into a storm
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.000]   or there's something about to happen
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.120]   and I'm going to have to resist.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:35.240]   I'm either going to have to do something
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.180]   or resist doing something,
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.660]   but there's something activated inside of me.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:40.020]   I think it's very important that we are all able
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:42.920]   to garner those resources and to activate those states
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.060]   within us voluntarily.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.260]   But I also know from experience and from observing others,
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.740]   and indeed from the literature
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:50.200]   on the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.540]   as it relates to eating disorders
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:55.700]   and other aspects of neurologic and psychiatric challenges,
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:58.640]   is that we also need to learn how to turn that off.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:02.040]   With that said, the little micro sucks that we discussed,
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.340]   the addition of a hundred jumping jacks
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.200]   at the end of a cardiovascular training session
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.600]   when you would much rather just shower up and go home.
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.480]   Getting into the cold shower or cold plunge
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.660]   when you absolutely don't want to do it,
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.640]   well, provided you can do it safely,
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.300]   that's going to be the best time to do it
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:19.560]   if your goal is to build up tenacity and willpower,
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:21.220]   to say nothing else of the known benefits
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:22.680]   of things like deliberate cold exposure
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.500]   and exercise like jumping jacks, et cetera.
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.760]   There are also entire landscapes of life
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.720]   and academics and sport that afford us the opportunity
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.360]   to build up tenacity and willpower.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.120]   I, for instance, can recall taking my so-called
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.800]   qualifying exams in graduate school
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.640]   where they ask you questions until you say, I don't know,
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.800]   until you don't know the answer.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:43.360]   It's just like that puzzle in the Baumeister study.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.400]   They're taking you to the point
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.640]   where you basically can't win.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:49.400]   And that turns out to be a very important lesson
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.160]   that extends beyond the information
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.120]   that they're asking you about.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.500]   And of course, every student at the end
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.800]   of their qualifying exam runs off
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.240]   and figures out the answer to the question
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.920]   that they couldn't get the right answer to.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.080]   Sometimes there is a right answer.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:00.920]   Sometimes they're not.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.380]   If the committee is pretty diabolical,
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.360]   they'll give you an impossible to answer question
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.520]   'cause there's no answer.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.800]   But the point being that whether or not it's in martial arts,
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:10.700]   whether or not it's in sports,
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:11.620]   whether or not it's in music,
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.620]   whether or not it's in academics,
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:15.120]   whether or not it's in relating to others,
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.740]   there is some value to getting to that point
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:20.000]   where you can't solve the puzzle.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.360]   And I think that's an important message
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.940]   for us to understand and maybe to incorporate
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:24.240]   into our tools and protocols
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:28.400]   that there are some endeavors that have no endpoint, right?
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.140]   There's no winning, there's no finish line.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:34.240]   And those type of endeavors are extremely important,
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:38.300]   extremely important for continually building up
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:40.820]   our tenacity and willpower.
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:43.020]   So much so that we can even take
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:47.920]   a somewhat 3000 mile view from the top down
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:49.720]   onto everything we've talked about today
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:52.620]   and think about those super agers.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.280]   Those super agers that somehow are able to maintain
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:58.240]   the cognitive function of a much younger person.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.860]   And if you look at the data on super agers
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:02.040]   and people similar to them,
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:05.160]   you'll find are always engaged in some activity
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:06.080]   that's hard for them.
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.280]   They're always trying to learn something
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.180]   and they have a sort of playfulness about it,
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:11.760]   but they seek out those friction points,
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.780]   both resistance of certain behaviors, right?
[01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:16.240]   Trying to not do certain things,
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:19.480]   but perhaps more often doing certain things,
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:24.460]   learning a new skill, learning pottery, learning music,
[01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:26.320]   placing themselves into novel environments
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.420]   that are a little uncomfortable or a lot uncomfortable
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.280]   provided that it's safe.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:33.200]   So from that standpoint, one could even entertain the idea
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.700]   that because these people are living much longer
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.880]   than everybody else, in addition to maintaining
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:40.840]   the cognitive function of much younger individuals,
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:43.460]   that perhaps the intermidsingulate cortex
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:47.120]   in its ability to allocate resources
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.160]   to different parts of our brain and body
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:51.520]   to meet certain motivational goals
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.400]   is actually associated with this thing
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.300]   that we call the will to live.
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:57.460]   Now, the concept of the will to live
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.700]   is certainly getting a little bit squishy
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:02.880]   for scientists like me who, yes,
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:04.480]   I'm happy to entertain discussions
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:06.460]   that relate to psychological constructs
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:07.980]   such as tenacity and willpower,
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.760]   but as you've probably noticed,
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.540]   I'm very comfortable with and very excited about the idea
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.820]   that, okay, maybe it's related somehow
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.720]   to brain energetics and glucose, maybe not.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.220]   Certainly I'm on board the idea
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.800]   that beliefs impact our physiology
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.620]   and physiology impacts our beliefs,
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:26.240]   ala Dr. Ali Krum, who was a guest on this podcast previously
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.800]   talked about belief and mindset effects,
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.920]   which are very powerful.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.600]   They change our physiology literally
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.420]   and the Dweck data that we talked about today.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:36.040]   But of course also that there are brain areas
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.680]   and circuits that underlie these things
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.760]   that we call tenacity and willpower.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.080]   So when we get into a discussion
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:43.300]   about tenacity and willpower and then find ourselves,
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:46.540]   as we are now, talking about the will to live,
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:48.900]   I don't think it's going too far to say
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:51.440]   that when one looks at the data on longevity,
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.920]   both physical and psychological longevity,
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:55.880]   it's very clear that there are
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.560]   underlying physiological explanations,
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:01.800]   not the least of which is likely to be the maintenance
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.900]   if not growth over the lifespan
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:05.980]   of this anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:08.780]   but also that the people that are achieving that
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:11.940]   are continually forging in their environment.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:14.440]   They're continually looking for new environments.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.260]   They're continually exploring.
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:17.840]   They are not becoming complacent.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.480]   They are not becoming sedentary.
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:22.200]   They're not existing down at that end of the continuum
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.040]   that we call apathy and depression,
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:26.340]   but that they're not existing down there
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:29.380]   and they are existing up toward the end of the continuum
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:32.780]   that we call tenacity and willpower
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.180]   and engaging motivation to get there,
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:37.300]   motivation, again, as a verb,
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:39.780]   but in doing that, that they're reinforcing
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:43.080]   the very circuits that give rise to tenacity and willpower.
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.660]   This is what, in engineering terms,
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.420]   is referred to as a closed loop.
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:49.420]   It's like you do A, which leads to B,
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:52.180]   which leads to C, which feeds back onto A
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:54.340]   and it makes A that much more likely to occur.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:56.700]   It's like turning the little a into a capital A
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:59.580]   and then turning into a boldface capital underline A,
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:01.460]   you know, the buildup of neural circuits.
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:04.260]   So while today we focused a lot on an individual brain area,
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:06.460]   anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:08.380]   and in many ways I presented it
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:11.260]   as if it's the be-all end-all of tenacity and willpower,
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:14.700]   it is not the be-all end-all of tenacity and willpower.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:18.820]   It's our ability to engage the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:22.500]   that allows us to express tenacity and willpower.
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:25.180]   But in this closed loop fashion,
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:27.780]   it's our ability to express tenacity and willpower
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.780]   that then feeds back onto that circuit
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:32.140]   and makes it more robust and more likely
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.300]   to be accessible in the future
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:35.740]   when we encounter something that we don't want to do
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:37.660]   or that we have to resist very strongly
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.200]   in order to not engage in some sort of behavior
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:41.340]   or thought pattern.
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.420]   So the big takeaway is that
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:44.600]   if you want to increase your tenacity and willpower,
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:46.220]   you absolutely can.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:48.700]   You can do that by triggering activation
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:51.240]   of this incredible hub within the brain,
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.040]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:56.760]   for which there is now a very large amount of evidence,
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:59.200]   is at least central to the whole process
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.680]   of generating tenacity and willpower,
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:03.160]   the I absolutely will do that,
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.760]   and the no, I absolutely won't do that.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.440]   It's the resistance hub.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.120]   It's the thing that's allocating resources
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:13.100]   to do the thing that we don't want to do
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.620]   or that someone's trying to prevent us from doing.
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:17.680]   It's also the brain area that's allowing us
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:19.900]   to resist doing the thing that we want to do
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.720]   or that someone else wants to do
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:23.960]   when we decide that's not good for us.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.120]   We can really be certain based on the psychology literature,
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:28.760]   based on the neuroscience literature,
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:30.840]   and really based on this beautiful literature
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:34.020]   that's now emerging that includes the column study,
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.320]   but some other studies as well
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.760]   that perhaps we'll talk about in a future episode,
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.040]   that we really can build up our capacity
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:41.320]   for tenacity and willpower.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.680]   It's a real thing.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:44.560]   And as a final point to this,
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:47.560]   and indeed as a final protocol,
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:50.600]   I was very excited to look into the early release
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.400]   of peer-reviewed papers out from Neuron just this last week,
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.280]   and to see that there was a study,
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.960]   albeit in a preclinical model, in an animal model,
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:03.660]   that explored what is called stress relief
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.600]   as a natural resilience mechanism.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:07.580]   And I won't go into this study in full detail,
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.420]   especially not now,
[01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:11.880]   laid into a slightly long episode such as this one.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.660]   But what the study showed is that
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:17.160]   when an animal is in a state of despair or ahedonia,
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.080]   a lack of pleasure, when it's under stress,
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:24.520]   and then that stress is removed, there's a sense of reward.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.920]   There's a sense of wellbeing
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.920]   that accompanies that release of stress.
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:31.100]   And that's pretty obvious.
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:33.560]   That's something that we've known about for a very long time.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.860]   But what's interesting about this study,
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:36.240]   and they actually talk about this
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:39.520]   in terms of its applicability potentially to humans,
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:43.200]   is that when we are able to withstand a stress,
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.200]   maybe that stress is school,
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.900]   maybe that stress is a particular relationship.
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.260]   Again, you never want to do these things
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:49.800]   in a way that's unhealthy or dangerous,
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.820]   but when we are able to do that,
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.560]   the relief that we feel afterwards
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.960]   is its own form of reward
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:58.560]   that serves to reinforce that whole process
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:01.760]   of tenacity and willpower that got us through the stressor.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.820]   And an interesting thing about this study
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:07.160]   is that they went on to compound that reward.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.680]   They showed that rewarding oneself
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:11.400]   for having gotten through a stressful episode
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:14.760]   actually serves to increase the capacity
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:17.340]   to get through stressful episodes in the future.
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:18.180]   In other words,
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.980]   if you decide to develop certain tools and protocols
[01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:22.220]   to increase your levels of tenacity and willpower,
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:26.040]   which frankly, I hope that you will at least consider,
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.940]   again, provided you do it safely,
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:29.960]   this seems like a very good thing to do for all of us,
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:32.180]   especially as we age, and guess what?
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.240]   We're all aging from the time we're born.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:37.840]   If you decide to do that,
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:40.940]   pick something that's challenging, overcome that challenge.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.040]   Again, this could be the requirement
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.160]   to engage in a particular behavior when you don't want to,
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:45.800]   or to resist a particular behavior
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:48.540]   that you would otherwise want to engage in.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:52.860]   But also when you've successfully completed that resistance,
[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:54.740]   when you've engaged that tenacity and willpower,
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:57.660]   and you've activated that anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:59.940]   well then occasionally, not always,
[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.400]   but occasionally providing yourself
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.700]   with a reward of something that you like,
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:04.980]   and here it's highly subjective.
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.340]   You'll just have to pick something that you like,
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:09.080]   again, something that's hopefully health promoting,
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.660]   not health diminishing,
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:13.540]   can serve to further reinforce the behavior
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:14.680]   that you just engaged in,
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:18.420]   which was to increase your tenacity and willpower.
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:19.740]   And if you listen to the episodes
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:22.220]   that I've done on dopamine motivation and drive,
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:24.740]   or on dopamine more generally,
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:29.620]   you will know that I am not a fan of rewarding oneself
[02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:32.460]   for wins or for engaging tenacity or willpower
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:35.220]   for that matter on a regular basis, or certainly every time.
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:37.020]   This is the sort of thing that just randomly,
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:39.380]   every once in a while, when you've done the hard thing,
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:42.780]   or if you've resisted the thing that was pulling on you,
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.220]   that you should reward yourself,
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:47.640]   but of course, reward yourself in healthy and safe ways.
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.380]   For those of you that are interested in learning more
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:53.040]   about how to reward the actions of tenacity and willpower,
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.160]   I'll provide a link to the recently published paper in Neuron
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:57.880]   in the show note captions.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.240]   I will also be doing a toolkit episode
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.000]   that relates to what we covered today,
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.940]   as well as some additional tools
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:06.080]   gleaned from other papers and resources
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:07.660]   in the not too distant future.
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.720]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.020]   all about tenacity and willpower.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:15.560]   We talked about the idea gleaned from research
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.020]   in the field of psychology
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:20.020]   that tenacity and willpower are limited resources.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:21.180]   And that perhaps, again,
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.220]   perhaps they relate to this concept of ego depletion
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:29.220]   that relates to this idea that what is depleted
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:32.220]   or what's limited in our ability to engage tenacity
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:35.100]   and willpower somehow relates to brain energetics
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:37.580]   and fuel consumption, namely glucose.
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:39.940]   I also talked about the conflicting data
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:43.380]   that argues that if we believe tenacity and willpower
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:48.060]   are limited and that glucose is the thing that limits them,
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:50.460]   well, then that's exactly what happens.
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:51.900]   So I talked about that controversy
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.140]   and some of the data that actually reconcile
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.500]   a bit of the differences there.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.000]   So in the absence of new data,
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]   you'll have to decide for yourself what you believe
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.380]   about tenacity and willpower.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:02.860]   However, it's very important to acknowledge
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:03.780]   the universal truth,
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:06.460]   which is that our tenacity and willpower
[02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:09.320]   rides on the tide of autonomic function.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:11.700]   That is, when we are sleep deprived,
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:14.660]   when we are in pain, when we are in emotional pain,
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:16.380]   or when we are distracted,
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.860]   our tenacity and willpower is diminished,
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:21.220]   which calls upon all of us to make sure
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.020]   that we're taking care of our autonomic functions
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:25.260]   through viewing morning sunlight, getting sufficient sleep,
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:26.860]   adequate nutrition, social connections,
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:29.420]   things that I've covered extensively on previous episodes.
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:31.480]   Then we talked about the neural underpinnings
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.700]   of tenacity and willpower
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:35.160]   and this absolutely incredible brain structure
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.220]   that we'll call a hub
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:38.340]   because it's not operating in isolation,
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.440]   but rather it's getting inputs
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.680]   from lots of different brain areas
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:44.260]   relate to reward, executive function, autonomic function,
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:47.660]   motor planning, goal-seeking, et cetera,
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.620]   that we call the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:52.680]   this phenomenally interesting brain area
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:54.920]   that seems to be able to generate this thing
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.500]   that we call tenacity and willpower,
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.520]   and that when we engage or express tenacity and willpower
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.020]   by doing the thing that we least want to do,
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:05.520]   by not doing the thing that we most want to do
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:06.580]   in a given moment,
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.300]   that we actually can build up
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:11.340]   our anterior mid-singulate cortex
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:14.700]   and thereby build up our future capacity
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.940]   to engage the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:19.740]   when we need to call on tenacity and willpower.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:21.940]   And then we talked about some of the peer-reviewed data
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:24.600]   that shows how that actually can be done,
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:27.740]   where these individuals who were not previously exercising
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:31.620]   did a challenging three one-hour sessions per week
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:32.580]   of cardiovascular training
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:34.540]   and indeed their anterior mid-singulate cortex
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.460]   and the connections to and away from it
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:38.940]   increased in a way that set them apart
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:41.320]   from their age-related cohorts.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:43.860]   That is, their brains stayed younger,
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:45.360]   maybe even got younger,
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.740]   whereas those that did not do the hard thing, right,
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:49.640]   that didn't engage tenacity and willpower
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:51.540]   did not experience the same effect.
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:53.380]   And then we talked about how those data could be extended
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:55.300]   into a number of different realms,
[02:03:55.300 --> 02:03:57.400]   such as cognitive learning, learning languages,
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.360]   learning math, learning art, learning
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:01.400]   any number of different things,
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:03.100]   or in the physical realm,
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:05.860]   engaging in certain types of exercise
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:07.980]   that one is not already engaging in,
[02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:09.980]   adding in a little bit of additional exercise,
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:13.420]   specifically at a time in which you least want to do that,
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:16.680]   or extending your fasting period
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:18.320]   if that's something that you're doing
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.500]   and that you can do helpfully,
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.900]   simply because it allows you to exercise
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:24.460]   your anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.620]   aka tenacity and willpower.
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:28.340]   And of course, we highlighted that all of that
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:30.260]   needs to be done in the context of psychological
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.560]   and physical safety.
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:32.720]   We don't want anyone to do things
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.920]   that are going to be physically damaging to themselves,
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.680]   but if one simply takes the stance of,
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:39.420]   okay, what's something that I can do in a moment
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:41.540]   that will allow me to build up tenacity and willpower?
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:42.680]   Well, it's going to be the thing
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.340]   that I least want to do in that moment,
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:45.840]   or the thing that I least want to resist doing
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.780]   in that moment,
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:48.540]   to periodically add in those little,
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:50.340]   what I refer to as micro-sucks,
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:54.180]   a very non-scientific, frankly, non-psychological term,
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.860]   but I think we all understand what it means,
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:57.240]   little things that we don't want to do,
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:58.900]   but that if we do them,
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.920]   you can be sure that you're activating
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.580]   the inter-mid-singulate cortex,
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:05.740]   and thereby increasing the probability,
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:09.360]   the likelihood that you can access tenacity and willpower
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.900]   more readily in the future.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:13.780]   So what I've done today is explain the scientific studies
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:16.660]   in the realm of psychology and neuroscience
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:19.460]   that explain what tenacity and willpower are,
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:20.960]   and what allows us to build up
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:23.380]   our tenacity and willpower over time.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:25.980]   And then it's really up to all of us,
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:27.800]   to you and to me and everybody else,
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:30.000]   to figure out in which particular domains
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.620]   and with which frequency
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:35.520]   we're going to decide to build up our tenacity and willpower.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.700]   So it's clear that tenacity and willpower
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.900]   are not just resources that we need to call upon
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:42.740]   from time to time in order to overcome things,
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:45.080]   but then indeed calling on our ability
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:47.980]   and building up our ability for tenacity and willpower
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:50.540]   can allow us a much richer enjoyment of life,
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:53.140]   and perhaps can even extend our life
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.060]   by engaging the will to live.
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:56.820]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:59.020]   about the science of tenacity and willpower,
[02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:01.860]   and tools and protocols to increase one's ability
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.440]   to access tenacity and willpower.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:06.820]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:36.060]   Not on today's episode,
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.920]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:40.340]   we discuss supplements.
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.440]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.600]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:46.000]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.260]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:50.740]   To see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:53.220]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:56.280]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.340]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:00.580]   you can do so by going to Huberman Lab
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:02.300]   on all social media platforms.
[02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:05.140]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:07.780]   LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:08.960]   On all of those platforms,
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.780]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:12.340]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:13.680]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:15.840]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.380]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:20.860]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:22.020]   If you haven't already subscribed

[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:25.600]   the Neural Network Newsletter is a zero-cost monthly
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:27.860]   newsletter that includes podcast summaries,
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:30.580]   as well as toolkits, so toolkits for sleep,
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:32.180]   toolkits for learning and plasticity,
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:35.580]   toolkits related to dopamine regulation, and much more.
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:36.780]   Again, it's all zero cost.
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:38.820]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:41.300]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,

[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:47.780]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:49.900]   about tenacity and willpower.
[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.160]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.100]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.680]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:59.260]   (upbeat music)
