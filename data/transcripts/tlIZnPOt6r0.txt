[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   We are still considering together these two central and pivotal verses in the Epistle
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.200]   to the Romans, in the first chapter, verses 16 and 17.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.520]   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.040]   to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.600]   For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.560]   just shall live by faith.'"
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.080]   Now here the Apostle, as we've seen, is announcing the great theme of his Epistle.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.160]   He arrives at it quite naturally by introducing himself to these Roman Christians and expresses
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.720]   his desire to be with them and assures them that though they are in Rome, which is such
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.400]   a great city with so many great people in it, and though he knows the views of such
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.120]   people in the mass and in the main of the gospel, he nevertheless is not ashamed of
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.840]   it.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.840]   And he gives us here his reasons for not being ashamed.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.440]   And in doing so, he announces the theme of the letter.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240]   In other words, he is saying this, that in view of the fact that he cannot be there physically
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.160]   to tell them these things, he is writing them.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.800]   So in the two verses he gives us the theme of the entire Epistle.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.280]   And we've started considering together the various reasons which the Apostle gives for
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040]   not being ashamed of the gospel.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.880]   The first is that it is gospel, good news.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.460]   The second is that it has reference to salvation.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.740]   And we saw what a great thing that is, how comprehensive.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.640]   Not merely forgiveness, that's only the first step, the beginning.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.320]   It stops at nothing less than men completely, fully reconciled to God and indeed ultimately
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.600]   glorified and perfect in the presence of God.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   It's the whole content of salvation.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.640]   It's the complete undoing of all that resulted from the fall.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.720]   You remember how John in his first Epistle says that it was for this cause that the Lord
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.120]   Jesus Christ was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.160]   Salvation means that everything that has resulted from the activity of Satan, producing the
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:47.560]   fall of men into sin, all that is undone and men is restored fully to his relationship
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   to God.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.360]   It's salvation.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.920]   And then the last point we mentioned last Friday was that he's not ashamed of it because
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.660]   it is God's way of salvation.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.440]   It is the power of God.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.280]   It's nothing human.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.880]   It is God's way of salvation.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.120]   And this, of course, is the thing in which he glories above everything else.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.400]   And all we shall have to say in a sense from this point onwards is but an amplification
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.280]   and an elaboration of how this is God's salvation and how God produces this salvation.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.320]   So that brings us to the fourth reason which the Apostle gives for not being ashamed of
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.560]   this Gospel.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.720]   And that is that it is a powerful Gospel.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.480]   It is the power of God.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.680]   Now we've got to be careful with every one of these terms.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.600]   Here we've got all the great terms in connection with salvation gathered together in these
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.840]   two verses, and we have to be very careful with every one of them.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.360]   Every one of them can be misunderstood.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.720]   And the history of the Church bears eloquent testimony to the way in which they can be
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.640]   misunderstood.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.420]   Now what the Apostle is saying here is this, that the Gospel is God's power unto salvation,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.480]   so that we must interpret it in such a way that we bring out clearly that it is some
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.560]   powerful action on the part of God, not on the part of men.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.840]   Very well then.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.200]   What does he mean by calling it a power, the power of God?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.660]   Well negatively we must say this, the Gospel is not a word about the power of God.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.800]   He says that it itself is the power of God.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.960]   I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.720]   What a mere description of it, not simply saying something about it.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.040]   It is the power.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.120]   That's the Apostle's actual statement.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.520]   So that another negative we would make is this, it is not God telling us what we have
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.720]   to do, because if that were so, well then the power required would be in us and not
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   in God.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.040]   No, it isn't that either.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.720]   But I'd go even further.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.880]   The Apostle here is saying that the Gospel is not simply a statement even of what God
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.160]   has done about our salvation.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.680]   It might have been that, but if it were that he wouldn't say that it is the power of
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.220]   God unto salvation.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.600]   He would say that it is a message telling us about God's power unto salvation, which
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.440]   is a very different thing.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.040]   So we must be quite clear about that.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:55.020]   It is not simply a message that tells us what God has done about us men and about our salvation.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.320]   It is that, but it's more than that.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.480]   I am emphasizing this because sometimes it is represented in that way.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.560]   The Gospel is represented as if it is just a statement as to what God has done, and therefore
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.720]   it comes to us and tells us, well now there's the possibility.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.120]   God has done that, therefore there is salvation possible for you.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.000]   But according to my understanding of this statement of the Apostle and what has been
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.640]   the traditional Reformed and Protestant understanding of it, that is not what he is saying.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.880]   Those negatives are therefore important.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   Well what is it?
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.280]   Well positively we put it like this.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:47.840]   Here he is telling us how God has prepared and made and produced and is working out his
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.520]   salvation in us.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.200]   Now you see that is something different.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.480]   The Gospel is God's way of saving us.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.440]   It is God's power producing salvation in us.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.640]   It is God, if you like, working his salvation in us.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.360]   Now you see the importance of that distinction.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:22.280]   It's a distinction that the Apostle makes quite frequently in his various epistles.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.320]   Take for instance how he says in that first chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.120]   where he says that the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:44.880]   Then he goes on to say that it was when the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.280]   by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.840]   Now you might translate that like this.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.560]   You say it was when the world by wisdom knew not God that it pleased God by the foolishness
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   of the thing preached, in other words the Gospel, to save them that believe.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.200]   That is how God does save.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.520]   It is through the foolishness of preaching or the foolishness of the thing that is preached.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.600]   Or another way he says it is this in the second epistle to the Corinthians in the fifth chapter
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.760]   and the fifth verse.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.720]   He says, "Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God."
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   That is the same idea exactly.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.280]   Or there is another very striking statement of it in the epistle to the Ephesians in the
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.040]   first chapter and in the nineteenth verse.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.440]   He prays for those Ephesians that they may know, amongst other things, the exceeding
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:51.800]   greatness of God's power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.420]   And it is very important that we should read that like that.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:01.520]   He wants us to know the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.000]   to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   the dead.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.920]   That is another way of stating that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.840]   Or yet another way is this.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.320]   In the second chapter of Ephesians in verse ten he says, "We are his workmanship."
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   Exactly the same thing.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   It is the same idea.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.400]   It is this power of God working salvation in us.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.220]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.240]   Think again in writing to the Philippians, Philippians 1.6, being confident of this very
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:45.280]   thing that "he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   Christ."
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.840]   That is the same idea.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.360]   Or again he puts it, you remember, in Philippians 2.13, "Work out your own salvation with fear
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.920]   and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.920]   pleasure."
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.120]   That is the way he works in us salvation.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.400]   We work out what God works in.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.680]   It is the power of God unto salvation, and it means that.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.880]   Or again the apostle Peter puts it in his first epistle, in the first chapter in the
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   fifth verse.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.200]   He says, "We are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.360]   revealed at the last time."
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.480]   Well then, what exactly does he mean by saying here that he is not ashamed of the gospel?
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.400]   Because it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.800]   He means, in other words, that it is God's mighty working in us unto salvation through
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.640]   and by means of the gospel.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.840]   So that what the apostle rarely has got in his mind here is this.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:02.120]   He is referring to all that God has determined before the foundation of the world, all that
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:09.360]   he has planned, all that he has brought to pass, all that he has done, and all that he
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.800]   will yet do in Christ through the Spirit.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.400]   That is what he means at this point.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   That is what he means.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.560]   His conception of salvation, as we have seen, is a total one, a complete one.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.760]   Well now, he says this gospel is God's power unto that.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:35.360]   So that in other words, he is saying what he says in Ephesians 1, 10, that in the dispensation
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:43.320]   of the fullness of times, he, God, might gather together in one, or might reunite again in
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:54.560]   one, all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.680]   him.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.240]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.560]   to every one that believeth.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   What does it mean?
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560]   Well, he means this.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.080]   It is the great power, to use the terms that we saw in that eighth chapter in the reading
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   at the beginning.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.200]   It is the power whereby God predestinates.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.880]   It is the electing power of God.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.800]   It is the powerful call of God.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.280]   It is the strength and power of God's justification.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.960]   It is the power whereby God regenerates men.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.320]   It is the power whereby God sanctifies us.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.480]   It is the power whereby and wherewith God preserves us.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.400]   It is the power wherewith God will glorify us.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.920]   Now did you notice those terms in the reading in verses 28 to 30 of that eighth chapter?
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, who are called
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.560]   according to his purpose.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.120]   How do we know that?
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.960]   How do we know that all things work together for good to them that love God?
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.680]   Well, the answer is this, for whom he did foreknow.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.920]   You see, we are considering the power.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.360]   This is why we are certain the power of God is in this.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.440]   The power of God is dealing with us.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.000]   If we love God, well, God's power has taken hold of us and we know this.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.560]   Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:40.080]   Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.520]   justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.040]   If God has predestinated, he will call, and it will be a powerful call, it will be an
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   efficacious call, it will be an irresistible call.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.840]   And whom he hath called, them he hath also justified.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.080]   He has done it.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.240]   And whom he hath justified, them he hath also glorified.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:08.680]   The thing is certain, says the apostle, because it is God's power that's doing it.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.520]   Now then, that's a very important thing, obviously, for us to understand.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   And that brings me to the next point in my description of it.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.080]   The apostle says he's not ashamed of this gospel.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   Why?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:29.240]   Well, because being the power of God, it is effective, it is efficacious.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.520]   And obviously he's got in his mind a very big contrast.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.800]   Men have been trying to save themselves always.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.560]   That's the meaning of their moralities and their philosophies.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.080]   They're trying to improve life, moral uplift, they say, idealism, trying to make the world
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.680]   a better place, and so on.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.960]   That's men trying to save himself and to undo the nefarious consequences of the fall and
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.840]   of sin.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.440]   But it comes to nothing.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.120]   Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.160]   There's a wise man who's considered it all, he's tried it all, he's watched others, and
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   he's come to the conclusion that it's all vain.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.000]   What has been will be.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.320]   Man in sin, he says, finally cannot be improved.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.280]   In spite of all the optimism, look at the facts.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   That doesn't work.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.080]   Ah, but someone might say, and the Jews were very ready to say it, they said, ah, that's
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.920]   all right, but they didn't have the law.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:33.760]   But we, they said, as Jews, have got the law, and if we keep the law, we can save ourselves.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.960]   It's going to succeed.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:41.140]   Now the apostle is here contrasting the gospel with the law.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.560]   This gospel works, that failed.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.220]   Now there it is in Romans 8, 3, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:59.000]   through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.080]   condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us."
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.260]   You see the idea.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.900]   He was ashamed, in a sense, of the law, because the law cannot save anybody.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:18.360]   As he says in Romans 3, 20, "By the law is the knowledge of sin; therefore by the deeds
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.580]   of the law can no man be justified in his sight.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.600]   For by the law is the knowledge of sin; and what I want is not knowledge, it's power
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.800]   to do it.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.300]   I may know what's right, but the question is how can I do that?
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.520]   Knowledge of the law doesn't enable me to keep the law and to fulfill the law."
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.420]   But says Paul, I've got a gospel which isn't like that.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.400]   This gospel works.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.200]   It succeeds.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.840]   He goes further.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.560]   It cannot fail.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.820]   It will not fail.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.240]   Now I read to you that portion out of the eighth chapter at the beginning deliberately
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.360]   because that's the great thing that is emphasized there.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.960]   And the apostle is throwing out his hint about it here.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.560]   "It's all right," he says, "don't you be ashamed of the gospel, you Roman Christians.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.520]   Let nobody be ashamed of this.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.800]   I'm not ashamed of it.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:21.720]   This is God's power, and because it is God's power, what God has determined is certainly
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.960]   and surely being brought to pass and shall be brought to pass."
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.120]   Do you notice his challenge?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.480]   What shall we say then to these things?
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.880]   If God be for us, who can be against us?
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   And then he elaborates that by putting it like this, "He that spared not his own son
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.800]   but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him also freely give us all
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   things?"
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.920]   And then still more, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?"
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.920]   What does he mean by that?
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   He means this.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:03.680]   Who is there who can prevent God's elect from being saved finally?
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   That's what he means.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.640]   Who is it who can stop it?
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.000]   It is God himself that justifies.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.560]   Who is he that condemns?
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.900]   If God is justifying, who can conceivably condemn?
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.240]   It is Christ that died, yea, rather that he is risen again, who is even at the right hand
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.920]   of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.720]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.920]   Now you see the argument.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   He is not ashamed of this gospel because this one works.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.040]   This one is going to produce the final result.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.160]   "Oh, wait a minute," says someone.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.280]   "It's all very well.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.320]   You think you are saved, but you still have to live in this world and there are enemies
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.880]   that are going to attack you and there is still the law and there is still the devil."
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.320]   "All right," says Paul, "I'll meet you."
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.520]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   Shall tribulation?
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.160]   Ah, tribulation is a terrible thing and it shakes people.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.640]   We have seen many starting brilliantly in the Christian faith and falling away when
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   trials and tribulations come.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.720]   You still say that it is sure and certain?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.320]   I do.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:20.520]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:27.720]   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.920]   It is absolutely certain.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:39.360]   And then the final great and magnificent statement, "I am persuaded, I am absolutely certain
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:46.120]   that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.280]   nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.720]   us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.960]   Nothing can separate us.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.160]   Our salvation in Christ is absolutely certain.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.400]   Christ himself said, "No man shall pluck them out of my hand."
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.760]   That is what the apostles say.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.080]   This is the gospel that is the power of God.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:20.720]   And because it is God's power, it is absolutely certain, "He saveth to the uttermost."
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:29.000]   Until we are finally and completely glorified and without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.120]   Now that is what the apostle is saying in this sixteenth verse of the first chapter.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.560]   This isn't something contingent.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.600]   This isn't something that may or may not work.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.560]   He says this is God's working, and when this work of God starts in a man, nothing is going
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   to stop it.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.800]   It is guaranteed to end in glorification.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.280]   If he is predestinated, it will be glorification for that person.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:59.280]   All the intervening steps are guaranteed, and nothing and no one in heaven or hell shall
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.400]   ever be able to separate such a person from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.920]   It is the power of God.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.120]   It doesn't depend upon me and my faithfulness.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.960]   If it did, we would all be lost.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:18.240]   It is God's power to save and to keep, to justify and to sanctify, to glorify, to take
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.160]   us right into heaven itself.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.520]   That is why he is not ashamed.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.080]   And you see now, it is very natural that he should rejoice in this and put it in this
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.240]   form, isn't it?
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.520]   Or take him as he puts it in the eleventh chapter.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.920]   It is equally definite there.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.240]   Oh yes, people say, "This is very wonderful.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.160]   You have been carried away by your own eloquence, Paul.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   But wait a minute, look at the children of Israel.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.880]   I thought they were God's people, but look what has happened to them."
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.680]   "It's all right," said Paul.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.600]   "You have got to understand the doctrine of the remnant.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.160]   God never said that every single Israelite after the flesh was going to be saved.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.120]   No, no, there is an Israel within Israel.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.720]   They are not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.360]   The remnant, according to the election of grace, they will be saved and will continue
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   to be saved, so that a day will come when all shall be saved who are to be saved, for
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.280]   the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:26.520]   The day is coming when we shall know for certain that the fullness of the Gentiles will have
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.660]   come in, and so all Israel shall be saved.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.060]   As it is written, 'They shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.060]   from Jacob.'"
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.820]   It is the same argument.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:45.180]   Let everything on earth and in hell do its utmost.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.500]   Because this is God's power, the fullness of the Gentiles will be saved, and all Israel
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.500]   will be saved.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.980]   Whatever meaning you put to that, it is certain.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.540]   And God's plan and God's purpose will be complete and entire.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.420]   "Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.500]   How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.220]   Who hath known the mind of the Lord, and hath been his counselor?
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.300]   Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:22.620]   For of him and through him and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.620]   Amen."
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.580]   That is what he is saying.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.100]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.100]   Why?
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.700]   Because it is the power of God.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.060]   And because it is God's dynamic activity, nothing can stop it.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.060]   It is certain.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:45.940]   This does work, this will work, until all that it has purposed shall have been completed.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.220]   But now that raises for us an interesting question, doesn't it?
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.660]   In what sense can we say that the gospel is this?
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.460]   That is what he says.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:02.460]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.820]   How is the gospel this power?
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.860]   Well, again, I want to emphasize that it itself is the power.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.220]   And here again is something that we find this apostle saying very, very frequently.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.820]   Listen to him, for instance, saying it in the first epistle to the Thessalonians, in
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.820]   the second chapter and the thirteenth verse.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:28.500]   "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because when he received the word
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:36.580]   of God which he heard of us, he received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.380]   the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe."
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:49.820]   It is a word that worketh effectually, the power of God, you see, through this word.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.500]   But there are many other instances of it.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.180]   Let me give you one or two.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:02.580]   In James 1.18 we read this, "Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth."
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.900]   He begat us by the word of truth.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.260]   Peter says a similar thing in 1 Peter 1.23.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:16.980]   "Who are born," he says to Christians, "not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.980]   by the word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever."
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.740]   They are born by the word of God.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.540]   Or again, take our Lord in his high priestly prayer in John 17.17.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:38.660]   "Father," he says, "sanctify them through thy truth.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.080]   Thy word is truth."
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.660]   So we are sanctified by the word.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:50.260]   Or you get the same idea in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, where Paul
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:56.340]   in verses 25 and 26 says, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:03.780]   church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.500]   water by the word."
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.820]   You see, the sanctifying and the cleansing there again is by the word.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.060]   So he means all that when he says that the gospel itself is the power of God.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.780]   And yet we have got to be careful.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.020]   He does not mean the mere letter of the word.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.420]   Now this is very important.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.740]   He does not mean the mere mechanical letter, because he says in 2 Corinthians 2.6, "Who
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:41.140]   hath also made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit,
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.300]   for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life."
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.660]   You know, a man can say the right things, but it will be quite dead, it will lead to
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   nothing.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980]   A man can preach the mere letter of the gospel.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.460]   That is not the power of God.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.020]   So it is not merely the letter.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:01.140]   Or again, as he puts it in 1 Thessalonians 1.5, "Our gospel came unto you," he says,
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.340]   "not in word only."
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:08.740]   It did come in word, but not in word only, but in power and in the Holy Ghost and in
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:15.980]   much assurance, so that while we say the power is in the word, it is not merely in the letter.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.220]   And so merely to give people a scripture does not of necessity save them.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.460]   A man can be reading the truth and nothing happens.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.340]   It is not mechanical.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:31.380]   And also we notice that in various places he tells us that it is Christ who is the power
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.880]   of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.060]   And in the second chapter of 1 Corinthians, he seems to say that it is the Holy Spirit
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.380]   that is the power.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.660]   He says he had not come and preached to them with enticing words of man's wisdom, but
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.460]   in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.940]   Well, how do we reconcile all these things together?
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.940]   Well, we can put it, I think, like this.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:04.740]   All that God has done in and through the Lord Jesus Christ for us, all the riches of God's
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:15.100]   grace in Christ come to us by the power of the Holy Spirit through the word of the gospel.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.780]   That is how God does it.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:22.260]   Shall we venture on an illustration?
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:30.460]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:40.540]   A man discovered about forty years ago in a scrap heap in Egypt a piece of an old papyrus,
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:47.220]   an old bit of vellum on which they used to write.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.740]   And in this he found a very interesting thing.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:57.500]   What he found was that the word in the original in Greek, which is translated here as "power
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:03.780]   of God," was used in many different ways in the common Greek that was spoken at that
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.260]   time.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.100]   Sometimes it means what we call today "dynamic."
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:15.340]   Yes, but it sometimes was also used for our word "prescription."
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.380]   Now, this isn't a theory of mine.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.940]   This was literally discovered in that old bit of papyrus.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:28.460]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the prescription of God unto salvation
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.340]   to everyone that believes in him.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   That's the gospel.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.380]   How do you work it out?
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.660]   Well, I work it out like this.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.740]   You go to your doctor when you're ill, and having diagnosed you, he sits down and he
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.340]   writes out a prescription, and he gives you the piece of paper with the prescription on
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.340]   it.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.020]   Well, the mere fact that you're holding a prescription in your hand won't cure you,
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.020]   will it?
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.140]   You say, "There's no power in that."
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.100]   Well, in one sense you're right, but I'm equally entitled to say there's tremendous
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.100]   power in that prescription.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:06.500]   In other words, the man has put on paper all this tremendous possibility, this power that
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.780]   can become yours through the various drugs that he's put down.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.340]   There is a sense in which you can say, "That's a marvelous prescription, that."
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.340]   We say that, don't we?
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.300]   We say, "That's a wonderful prescription."
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.340]   You buy, when you've got a cough, those G's Linctus tablets.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.540]   It was a prescription by a famous Dr. G, one of Queen Victoria's royal physicians in the
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.420]   last century, Dr. Samuel Jones G.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.300]   He wrote out a prescription, this marvelous Linctus, to prevent a useless and an irritable
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.240]   cough.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.860]   And people say, "That's a wonderful prescription, that's a mighty, that's a powerful prescription
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.860]   of Dr. G's."
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.620]   That's quite right, but of course, in a sense, there's nothing in the prescription.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.060]   And yet, you see, there is.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.100]   The prescription comes into it.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.340]   And you take your prescription at its dispense, and then you take your medicine, and the power
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.340]   is manifested.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:01.980]   Now, it seems to me that the relationship between the work of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:07.340]   the application of that work by the Holy Spirit, and the gospel itself, the word preached,
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.500]   is something like that.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.940]   In this connection, the gospel, the word, is the prescription.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.660]   So the apostle says, "I'm not ashamed of this prescription I'm carrying in my pocket.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.300]   I know what it can do."
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:26.140]   Now, I always like to link that up with what we were considering in verse 14, where Paul
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.580]   says, "I am a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.580]   the unwise."
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.420]   I like to put it like this.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.260]   The apostle says, "Oh, I can't help preaching.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.260]   I'm a debtor.
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.260]   I'm a sinner."
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.540]   I feel like this.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:48.580]   I feel like a man feels who has been, once upon a time, suffered from some terrible disease,
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   some affliction.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.660]   Let's say it was a disease of the joints, for instance.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.740]   I was having terrible pains in my joints, and I found walking very difficult.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.900]   I could scarcely move.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.420]   Of course, I went to my doctor.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.660]   He did his best, but I was no better.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.300]   I tried others, consultants.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.980]   They did their best, no good.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.260]   I heard of all sorts of people.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.260]   I went to the mall.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.260]   I crossed the ocean.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.940]   I heard of people on the continent.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.940]   I tried them all.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.100]   They all did their best, but I was no better.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.500]   At last, I met a physician.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.660]   Somehow or other, at once, I felt he was different.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.020]   He seemed to understand me.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.980]   He seemed to know all about it.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.780]   He said, "Yes, I know exactly, and I can put you right."
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.260]   He sat down at his desk, and he wrote out his prescription.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.420]   He said, "You take that, and get that, and take it, and you'll be all right."
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.980]   I did so.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.780]   I began to feel my pain going, and my joints became more subtle.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.100]   I became perfectly well.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.420]   I can move as I please.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.260]   I'd almost forgotten that I was ever ill, and a semi-cripple.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.860]   This is now my experience.
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:56.340]   I walk up and down the streets of life, and suddenly one afternoon, I see a man coming
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.580]   up on the other side of the street.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.020]   I don't know the man, but I do know his complaint.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.820]   He's got my old trouble.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.300]   I can tell by the way he's walking.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.340]   I can tell by the way he's holding himself.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.780]   He is now as I once was.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.620]   Well, what about it?
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.380]   Well, it's obvious, isn't it, that he doesn't know about this prescription that I've got
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.340]   in my pocket.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.940]   I've got in my pocket what can put that man right.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:22.940]   What do I do?
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.140]   Well, there's no need to argue about it.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.180]   I'm a debtor to that man.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.700]   I don't need to think about it.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.820]   I must tell him.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.420]   I must cross the road and accost him and say, "Excuse me, sir, you don't know me, and I
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.740]   don't know you, but I do know what's the matter with you.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.140]   Tell me, have you ever heard of this producing my prescription?"
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.860]   You know, says Paul, if I allowed that man to go on suffering like that, when I know
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.060]   of the certain cure, I'd be a cad.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:52.460]   I've got the prescription with the potency, the power, the thing he needs.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.460]   I must tell him.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.460]   I'm a debtor.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.540]   There's a sense of constraint.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.100]   I must woe is unto me if I don't.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   I'm driven by the very knowledge I have.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.780]   That's to be the truth of every Christian.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:12.020]   We know that this gospel of ours is the power in that sense, and we tell others of it.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.480]   We preach it to them.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:20.020]   We tell them about it, and we assure them that it is potent and that it will yield the
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   results.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:27.420]   Now, it seems to me, therefore, that the relationship between these things, the work of Christ,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:32.240]   the application of the Spirit, and the gospel, the Word, is something like that.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.860]   Each one of them is referred to as the power, and each one is the power.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:45.100]   But they work together in that way to the production of this certain, assured, unshakable
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:51.460]   and unassailable salvation in Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.940]   There's a hymn which helps us to understand it.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:35:01.500]   I think it's a hymn of William Cooper's, "The Spirit breathes upon the Word and brings
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   the truth to sight."
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   That's it.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:09.740]   It's there, but the Spirit lets it free, releases it, if you like.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.940]   And so all happens.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:17.180]   Well, you can think of other illustrations for yourselves to bring out the same point.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:23.460]   The thing is the grasp that the apostle is saying that he's not ashamed of it, because
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.420]   it's God's mighty working.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:32.260]   It's God himself doing this thing, not simply telling us about it, doing it, and doing it
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.740]   in this way through the gospel.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:40.180]   And that brings me to my last point this evening, which is this.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:45.420]   The fifth reason, therefore, for the apostles not being ashamed of it is this, that it is
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.060]   a gospel for all.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.700]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:58.340]   to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.820]   And you notice his logic, don't you?
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:08.020]   Why is this a gospel for everyone, for anyone?
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.380]   The answer is because it's God's power.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.940]   If it were not God's power, it would not be for anyone.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.620]   He's going to prove that.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.500]   The Gentiles which hadn't got the law were complete failures.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.440]   The Jews who had the law were equally failures.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:29.380]   No man can save himself, either with or without law.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.820]   But this is God's power.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.300]   And because it is God's power, there is this entirely new factor.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.460]   Very well he says, "to the Jew first," and also to the Greek.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.620]   Why does he say, "to the Jew first"?
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.260]   Oh, it's not a matter of importance.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.940]   He doesn't say, "to the Jew especially."
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.240]   He doesn't say, "to the Jew because he's a Jew and because he's of greater importance
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   than anybody else."
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:02.180]   Oh no, he's referring to it, of course, in its time relationship, chronologically.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:07.540]   "Salvation is of the Jews," said our Lord to the woman of Samaria.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.340]   Quite right it was.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.660]   After the flesh he came of the seed of David.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.700]   It started with the Jews.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.980]   And our Lord's commission to the apostles when he sent them out was this, "Ye shall
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.940]   be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem."
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.700]   That's where you start, then unto Samaria.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.620]   While he was yet on earth, he confined himself to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.980]   It starts with the Jew.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.740]   And historically it did start with the Jew.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.420]   But it didn't stop with the Jew.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:48.520]   It went from them to Samaria and then to the ultimate parts of the earth.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.980]   So it is to the Jew first, in that sense, as a sheer matter of history.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:59.420]   They were God's own people, his chosen people, so first the gospel must be preached to them.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.940]   And the apostle Paul, when he set out, he began with the Jews.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.580]   And it was only when they rejected that he said, "Henceforth I go to the Gentiles.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.660]   I turn away to the Gentiles.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.300]   Your blood be on your own head."
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.580]   Always, therefore, it started like that historically.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.540]   But you know, that isn't the only thing he means by this.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:24.020]   I think he's emphasizing something else here.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.020]   There were many who might have said and did say in those days that this gospel was only
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.460]   for the Gentiles.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.380]   That the Jew being a Jew didn't need it.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.700]   But the Gentiles being outsiders, of course, might need it.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:44.780]   "Oh no," says Paul, "this is the power of God unto salvation to the Jew first.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.300]   He needs it as much as anybody else.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.180]   He needs it as much as the Gentiles need it."
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.500]   Now, it's very important I should say that for this reason.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.220]   If you don't grasp that, you will see no sense or meaning at all in the second or the
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.900]   third chapter of this great epistle.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.460]   Because the whole argument of chapters two and three is just to prove that the Jews,
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.620]   though they had the law, were as lost and as hopeless as the Gentiles.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:15.900]   They need the power of God unto salvation exactly as everybody else does.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.660]   So don't you think this is only for Gentiles, says Paul.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:25.260]   It is for the Jew first and also for the Greek, for the Gentile.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:31.580]   And it is very vital we should emphasize and apply that at the present time.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:37.220]   You know, I know many people still who seem to think and to say that only certain people
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.340]   need to be converted.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.740]   They say, "Surely, you don't preach to us as sinners.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.940]   We've always been brought up in chapels, taken to Sunday school since we were children."
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.740]   Of course, I can understand if you're preaching to people who've never been in a place of
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.620]   worship in their lives and have just given themselves to sin.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.740]   I can see their need of being born again and forgiven and justified and so on.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.260]   But surely not for us.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.380]   We've always been moral and good and upright and decent.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:09.380]   The answer to such talk is, "To the Jew first."
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:16.700]   Such a person needs it as much as the other, if not more, because of their terrible self-righteousness.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.540]   To the Jew first.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.620]   Everybody needs this salvation.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.060]   No man can save himself.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.340]   By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.340]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.800]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.840]   Everybody needs the same power of God unto salvation.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:51.380]   But finally, and oh, thank God for this, if it is true to say that all need it, it is
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:41:01.260]   equally true to say that it holds out a hope for all, and there's nothing else that does.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.180]   There are many people who are deemed to be hopeless by the world.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.500]   There is nobody hopeless as regards the gospel.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   Why?
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.660]   It's the power of God.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.780]   Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   No.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.820]   But with God, nothing shall be impossible.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:26.620]   There is no one who because of sin alone is outside salvation.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.860]   There is no such thing as being too great or too big a sinner to be saved.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.540]   The number of your sins don't come in at all.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.140]   The character of your sins don't matter one scrap.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.780]   There is no difference in the sight of God between a murderer and the most self-righteous
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.460]   person, none whatsoever.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.300]   Both are equally lost.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.940]   And this is the glory of this gospel.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:42:00.500]   There is as much hope for the most desperate, vilest, blackest sinner as there is for the
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.420]   nicest and most respectable person.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.420]   Why?
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.900]   Well, it's the power of God in both cases.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.580]   And to God there is no difference at all.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.420]   Oh, what a comfort!
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   What a consolation!
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.180]   Is it surprising the apostle wasn't ashamed of this gospel?
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:25.300]   He could go to Rome knowing this, that even the most desperate desperados in the nightclubs
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:30.500]   of Rome could be saved by this gospel.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:36.540]   It doesn't matter how low one may have sunk, how vile one may have sinned away one's
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.620]   brains almost, after all one's character had long since gone.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.380]   It didn't matter.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:48.260]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.620]   His blood availed for me.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.020]   I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:59.700]   It is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.700]   Antecedents don't matter.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   Past doesn't count.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.620]   It will all be blotted out by this power.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:12.220]   And the man shall not only be forgiven but made anew, a new creation with the power of
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.340]   God within him and the divine nature in him.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:23.060]   And so be started on that wonderful course which in the hand and by the power of God
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:31.620]   will lead to his final glorification and rejoicing in holiness in the presence of God.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:39.740]   Very well, my friends, there then we leave it until, God willing, on April the 13th when
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:48.700]   we shall go on to see how all this has now been revealed, how God's way of doing it has
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:53.260]   been revealed in and through the gospel.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.500]   Let us pray.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:05.420]   Almighty God, our heavenly Father, we know not what to say.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:13.700]   We can but humble ourselves, O God the Father, in humble worship and praise.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:22.260]   O God, what we cannot understand, what amazes us, is that thou shouldst ever have even looked
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:26.020]   upon us or thought of us.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:36.220]   Leave alone, plan and prepare and put into execution this powerful, mighty, absolute
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.220]   salvation.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:44.100]   O God, thy love amazes us.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.020]   We do not understand, we can but thank thee.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:53.060]   O reveal it unto us, we pray thee, more and more in its depth and height and breadth and
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:58.020]   length, that we may know the love of Christ that passeth knowledge.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:03.340]   We thank thee for the security, we thank thee for the certainty, we thank thee for the ability
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:10.820]   to defy everything that is against us, because we are thy workmanship and because salvation
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.500]   is thy work.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:20.220]   O God, we pray thee that thou wouldst give us grace to work out mightily that which thou
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:26.620]   dost work in us mightily, both the will and to do of thy good pleasure.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:31.220]   Hold us with thy powerful hand.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:37.740]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:44.020]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:51.540]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:58.460]   shall be in glory and see him face to face.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.660]   Amen.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.580]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
