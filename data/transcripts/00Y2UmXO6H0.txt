[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   looking at the history of information technology innovations, it's hard to imagine the book with
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.240]   movable type, Gutenberg, right? It's hard to imagine an innovation that did more to like
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.320]   flatten distance in the book, right? Now you can like read stuff that people are saying
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.560]   hundreds of miles away. And yet there's not a shred of evidence that the book led to less
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.520]   urbanization in Europe or to less connection. It helped create a totally different world in which
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.760]   people were passionate about ideas and wanted to talk to each other. And they wanted to talk to
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.800]   each other about their books. And then, you know, flash forward 350 years and we have the telephone.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.200]   And again, telephones started being used more in cities and they started being,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.480]   they were used mostly by people who were going to meet face to face. And again,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.800]   no evidence that this has created, you know, a decline in the demand for face-to-face contact
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.280]   or a decline in the demand for cities. So I think if we look at Zoom, which unquestionably has allowed
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.440]   a certain amount of long distance contact, that's very, very useful. My guess is in the long run,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.240]   it's probably going to be likely to be neutral at worst for face-to-face contact in the cities
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.280]   that enable that contact.
