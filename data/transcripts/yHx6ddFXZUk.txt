[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   A regular podcast listener from the fine city of London writes in with this question, "Hello
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.320]   Pastor John, my name is Laura.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.960]   I would love to know what it actually means when Paul says, 'For me to live is Christ'
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840]   in Philippians 121.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.280]   I can't seem to pinpoint a solid definition without just giving examples of what that
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.160]   kind of life would look like.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.400]   How would you explain this?
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.760]   What does it mean to live is Christ?"
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.920]   Well, there aren't many things I love to think about more than the context of Philippians
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   1.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   And you're going to see why before we're done.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.880]   I'm a Christian heeding this through and through, and it doesn't get any better than these verses
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.840]   and the parallels in chapter 3.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.640]   So I think in answer to Laura's question, there are two ways to define, "For me to live
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   is Christ," first from the immediate context of verses 20 to 26 of chapter 1 in Philippians,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.320]   and secondly from chapter 3.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.760]   And you'll see why both of those are so relevant.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.720]   So let's walk through it and she'll see right away how this works.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.080]   "It is my eager expectation and hope," this is verse 20, "It is my eager expectation and
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.080]   hope that I will not be ashamed, but that with full courage, now as always, Christ will
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.240]   be magnified."
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.200]   There's this central passion in life, that Christ will be magnified, shown to be magnificent
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   in my body, whether by life or by death.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.000]   "For," and here come these two phrases, "For me to live is Christ," that's the one she's
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.920]   asking about, and the other one is, "And to die is gain."
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.640]   So to live is Christ and to die is gain are two ways of Paul's magnifying Christ with
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340]   his body.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.560]   So what we want to know is, how is Christ magnified in Paul's life?
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280]   Because that's what he's aiming at in this text.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.520]   To live is Christ.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.920]   To live is to magnify Christ.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.420]   To live is to show that Christ is magnificent.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.600]   So watch how he does it.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.220]   "If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me."
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.500]   So the first thing he says about to live is not Christ, but fruitful labor.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.660]   So what does that mean?
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.240]   What is fruitful labor that magnifies Christ in such a way that you can say to pursue this
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.980]   fruit is to pursue the glory of Christ?
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.940]   So he keeps going in verse 24.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.740]   "To remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:56.380]   Because of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.540]   and joy in faith."
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:11.340]   So his fruitful labor that he's staying alive for is labor to increase the joy of the faith
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.700]   of the Philippians.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:24.580]   So if they have greater joy by embracing Jesus—that is, believing, embracing Jesus in faith—Jesus
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.340]   is made to look magnificent, and Paul's life is achieving its purpose from verse 20.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:42.580]   So your joy of faith in Jesus is the fruit of my labor, and that makes Christ look great,
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.020]   and that's what it means for me to live Christ.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.340]   Now he keeps going, verse 26.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:00.540]   "So that in me you may have ample cause to glory or boast in Christ Jesus because of
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.060]   my coming to you again."
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.900]   So by his coming to them—that is, coming to increase their joy of faith, coming to
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.260]   bear fruit in his labor—by his coming to them and ministering to them and increasing
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.620]   their joy of faith, they are increasing in their glorying or boasting in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:33.860]   So the upshot of Paul's life is that other people are making much of Jesus by being joyful
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.920]   in Jesus and boasting in Jesus.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.400]   This is what it means for Paul to live his Christ.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:49.940]   To live his Christ means to live to be the means of other people making Christ look magnificent
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.580]   by finding Christ to be their supreme treasure and their greatest satisfaction.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.280]   That's what glorying in Christ and being happy in Christ means.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.580]   So that's the first answer.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.580]   Now watch it get amazingly confirmed if you jump over to chapter 3, verses 7 and 8.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.500]   And the link is clear in Paul's mind because the word "gain" over here in chapter 1,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.380]   he says, "To die is gain."
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.620]   Now watch the uses of the word "gain" in chapter 3, verses 7 and 8, where the same
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.320]   way of thinking that Christ being a supreme treasure makes Christ look magnificent, which
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.740]   is what Paul's life is about.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.260]   So here's what it says.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.260]   "Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:56.380]   Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.780]   Jesus my Lord.
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:05.460]   For his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.620]   that I might gain Christ."
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:17.100]   Now back in chapter 1, to die was to be with Christ, and therefore dying was gain, and
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.860]   therefore his dying magnified Christ because it showed that Christ was more valuable than
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.420]   everything he had lost in death.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.780]   Now here in chapter 3, he's unpacking "to live is Christ" in the same way, with the
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.720]   same argument, only instead of losing everything by dying, he says, "I'm counting everything
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.820]   as loss even while I live."
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:49.300]   So to show that the value of Christ is better than the things I have in life even while
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.820]   I am alive.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:59.900]   So again, "to live is Christ" means to live in such a way as to make Christ look
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.420]   magnificent as your supreme treasure.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:10.140]   Now I can't let this go—circle back to the beginning where I was all excited about
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.540]   Christian hedonism—I can't let this go without making explicit that these contexts
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.660]   in Philippians 1 and Philippians 3 are two of the most important foundations for what
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.340]   I call Christian hedonism and what I've devoted my whole life trying to understand,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.540]   trying to preach, which I usually sum up by saying, "God is most glorified in us when
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.620]   we are most satisfied in him."
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:43.300]   But here's the way I would say it by putting together both "to die is gain" and "to
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.940]   live is Christ" in verse 20 of chapter 1.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.100]   Here's the way I'd say it.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:58.820]   Christ is most magnified in us when we are more satisfied in him than what we lose in
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.400]   death and what we have in life.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:11.180]   In both cases, the goal of Paul's life is attained—that Christ is magnified in his
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:19.060]   body, whether by life or by death—and the key to magnifying Christ in life and in death
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:28.580]   is to find him more precious, more valuable, more satisfying, more joyful, more boastworthy
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:37.580]   than everything we lose in death—to die is gain—and everything we have in life—to
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.940]   live is Christ.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.940]   That is glorious.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.260]   I love that.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:49.420]   "Christ is most magnified in us when we are more satisfied in him than in what we
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.660]   lose in death or what we have gained in life."
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.660]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.580]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.740]   week.

[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.460]   The anticipation for Christmas is growing.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.420]   Christmas music is on the radio, and pumpkin spice lattes are in the air, and colorful
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.980]   lights are brightening the night.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.180]   As we approach Christmas this year, we embark on a six-part series on the podcast related
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.180]   to Advent.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.180]   We're going to answer some of your very hard questions about the conception and birth
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.180]   and childhood of Jesus.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.660]   It's going to be good.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.420]   These are some really excellent questions that you've sent in.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.100]   We've lined them up, and the series begins on Friday.
