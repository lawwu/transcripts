[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.760]   - Indeed, live and in person this time.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.560]   Last time you were on the show,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.660]   you and your wife had been traveling, it was July,
[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.500]   so you'd been traveling at that time for a month?
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.540]   - Barely a month.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.540]   We had just gotten on the road
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.380]   and now here we sit, we have traveled 21,000 miles,
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.680]   nine or 10 months in 72 square feet,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.740]   living in a cargo van with my wife
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.920]   and we still love each other so much.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.020]   - So you're taking the answer to my question up front.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.860]   Would you do it again?
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.700]   We have learned so much in living this time together
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.020]   in a small space,
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920]   traveling all over the United States and Canada.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.460]   I'll tell you, we would do it so much
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.360]   that we're gonna do it again in 2019.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.400]   We've got a whole 'nother leg of the trip around the country
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.740]   and I would tell you where we're going,
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.200]   but I don't know yet, that's the beauty of it.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000]   - So give new listeners who didn't hear
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.500]   your first appearance on the show,
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.720]   the 30 second version of what happened
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.220]   and how you and your wife came to travel like this.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.320]   - My wife and I lived in New York City
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.220]   and because of a job layoff,
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520]   we had a new opportunity to do
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.220]   kind of whatever we wanted to
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.820]   and so we decided to sell and give away
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.660]   all of our possessions, got rid of our apartment,
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.800]   bought a used cargo van and together built
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.700]   a 72 square foot off-grid home inside the cargo van
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.540]   and decided that that would be,
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.700]   that and gas would be our only expense
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.680]   and we traveled all over the country,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.720]   in part embedding with communities
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.220]   that have chosen to, as we would say,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.880]   opt out of a lot of mainstream ways of living
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.120]   to try to find a new American dream
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.960]   and we met a lot of people along the way
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.220]   and it is not for everyone,
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.120]   but we learned to live for free all across America,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.300]   so many places you can sleep and stay overnight
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.160]   without paying a dime and our only expenses
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.100]   were food and gas and maybe some fun.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.000]   - And the most important thing about that transition
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.840]   is you were living in a penthouse apartment in Manhattan,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.740]   so you were in the middle of the hoity-toity crowd
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.080]   and now you're a van dweller,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.740]   so this was quite the transition.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.320]   - It was a complete transition,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.180]   although we were kind of transitioning that direction
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.960]   in how we lived our lives in Manhattan.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.160]   I worked in media and I was very much sucked
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.360]   into the everyday minutiae of the world,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.700]   of Washington and of culture and of politics,
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.400]   but we set some very strict rules
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.700]   when we lived in New York City
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.200]   about how we would live when we were together
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.540]   in our apartment, for example, not to be vague,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.320]   but for example, we would not have any device use
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.880]   beyond the threshold of the door in the apartment
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.680]   and when we were home together,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.380]   we were present and home together
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.820]   and we would live this kind of quiet log cabin existence
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.520]   in the middle of Manhattan while we were home
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.720]   and that's really the way we were heading
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.760]   and it just so happened that we ended up taking it
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.320]   into an extreme level by living in the woods
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.900]   in a van for nine months.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.340]   - So your experience and my own family's experience,
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.440]   we've just returned from almost six months on the road,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.080]   not quite as many miles, but about 13,000 miles
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.640]   and I guess 25, 30 states, something like that,
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.540]   I need to go back and count them,
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.440]   but we've also had an interesting experience
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.740]   and the bulk of what we're gonna focus on
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.080]   in today's discussion is basically
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.180]   the United States of America,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.620]   what's happening at this moment
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.360]   and I thought this would be a really fun interview
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.740]   for us to do together
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.540]   because we both have curious personalities.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.540]   You come from a professional reporter's background,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.100]   so you have that natural bent or cultivated bent probably
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.960]   to asking questions and learning people's stories.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.980]   You've traveled all four corners of the country
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.160]   over the last six months.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.500]   We've traveled a good portion of the country
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.520]   and one of my main reasons for going out and traveling,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.540]   in addition to personal reasons,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.900]   was to get a sense of what's happening
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.060]   in the United States of America.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.360]   One of the big challenges for me
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.420]   in building radical personal finances,
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.180]   I no longer have a water cooler
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.500]   or a coffee pot to talk around.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.300]   It's very easy for me in a normal week
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.060]   to sit in front of my computer
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.900]   and all of my work is solitary.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.640]   I don't work physically with any coworkers,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.340]   I just sit in front of my computer
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.540]   and I get together with a few personal friends
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.820]   and some church friends and that's about it
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.560]   as far as my in-person interaction.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.480]   And what I have learned is that's very dangerous for me
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.080]   because then it leads me trying to form my understanding
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.720]   of what's happening in the world from Twitter
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.600]   or from YouTube or from NewYorkTimes.com
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.520]   or whatever those kinds of things are.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.200]   And I've struggled to maintain a grip on reality
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   without having coworkers to talk to at the coffee pot.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.780]   And so today we're gonna talk about
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.000]   what's happening in the country
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.960]   and you and I have both been out traveling,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.680]   getting a sense of what's happening.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.880]   So my question for you,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.400]   is what you've observed over the last six months
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.440]   a surprise to you?
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.680]   Is the world about how you thought it was
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.800]   when you were living in Manhattan or is it very different?
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.720]   - The short answer is no, I learned a lot.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.400]   First of all, let me set the scene of how we lived.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.040]   So part of this experience,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   I almost completely opted out of any exposure to media.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.380]   I have not read the news in months,
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.740]   although I found I'm exposed to information.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.500]   People just tell me things, so I don't feel less informed,
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.100]   but I used to read the news on a moment to moment basis.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.340]   - And you were reporting the news.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.540]   - I was reporting, that used to be the news, right?
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.580]   But I also don't consume online content anymore.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.540]   My phone went from a content machine
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.420]   to just something that tells me how to get places
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.940]   or where a restaurant is.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.980]   And that's just about, and to make phone calls and texts,
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.700]   and that's it.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.760]   And so it seems like while I was on the road
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.000]   for the past nine months,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.320]   the whole country was acting like everything was on fire.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.920]   And yet the world that I was encountering
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.440]   on a human to human basis was nothing like that.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.500]   I don't know if people are living multiple lives
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.660]   where on Facebook, they act like everything is crazy
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.600]   and that they feel crazy, but in person and out,
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.720]   I'm gonna say out in the country,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.520]   but I used to live in Washington, DC and in New York City,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   and there it's just all right in your face.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.960]   And you start to think that those East Coast cities
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.000]   are the only cities, not that matter, but that exist.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.360]   And everything else is just like,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.640]   it's a thing out there.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.460]   And I know that that is a stereotype,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.520]   but that is, you get to a very narrowly focused viewpoint
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.360]   when you live in those places for a long time
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.340]   and to get out into the country and just listen to people.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.320]   So I found that for the most part,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.420]   people are living really happy, positive lives
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.820]   and they're not focused so much on the news
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.200]   as people think they are.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.560]   They're focused on their family, their jobs
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.920]   and what they're gonna do this weekend.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.880]   And that is what they talk about.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.480]   Let me give you an example, Josh.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.600]   So I made it a point when I was in my job,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   I always had to ask people about politics.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.640]   That was my job.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.480]   What do you think of Trump?
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.520]   What do you think of Hillary Clinton?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.260]   What do you think of what's going on?
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.000]   Well, going out on my own really gave me an opportunity
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.160]   to not ask those questions and see what people say.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.080]   In nine months, no one brought up politics once.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.820]   And I talked to a lot of people.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.000]   I let them guide the conversation.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.560]   Not a single person mentioned
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.360]   what was going on in Washington.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.320]   Now they might've just been polite 'cause I was new,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.960]   but I spent a good amount of time with people,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.000]   maybe series of days.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.240]   There is so much more to talk about
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.280]   and they have an interest in talking about it,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.940]   but it didn't have anything to do what was in the newspaper.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.920]   And I found that phenomenally refreshing,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.580]   but also fascinating as well.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.840]   - Right, right.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.880]   So frankly, Chris, I don't know how to analyze this.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.320]   So I also, when we were traveling,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.460]   I also was very cut off from much of the media world.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.580]   I've had massive problems
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.700]   disconnecting myself from my phone
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.880]   in order to get anything done.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.060]   I'll tell you how extreme I've had to be.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.240]   So for years, I've taken off social media.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.880]   I used to be addicted to YouTube.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.040]   I took off YouTube.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.820]   Then I took off all the social media apps.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.720]   It got so bad that for me to get something done,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.360]   I had to completely eliminate my browser,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.560]   my web browser from my phone.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.440]   So for the entirety of our traveling around the country,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.080]   not once I didn't log on to Facebook.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.760]   I haven't logged on in eight months at this point.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.960]   I didn't log on to almost anything.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.080]   And I did not have a web browser on my phone.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.960]   My wife has much more self-control than I do.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.000]   So if we needed to look something up, we use her phone
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.480]   'cause I did not have it.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.860]   And it completely removed the utility
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.700]   of this thousand dollar device in my pocket.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.780]   But it made me much more peaceful.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.540]   But I would drive around and I would look at people
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.540]   and I would imagine the arguments
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.460]   that I used to get into online.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.100]   And I'd be driving past some house in Colorado
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.020]   or they see a house and I would think,
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.620]   this person is on Facebook.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.500]   This person is talking there.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.380]   But this life that I see around them
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.240]   doesn't seem connected to the arguments
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.820]   and the vitriol and the politics and whatnot there.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.780]   So is it just that the people are living,
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.820]   and I had the same experience,
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.580]   that people didn't talk in real life
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.940]   like we do all of us online.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.680]   So is it just that we maintain two different personalities,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.820]   one real life person and one an online persona?
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.220]   Or are there just the people in Washington and New York,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.620]   they're the ones who are arguing and no one else cares?
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.860]   - No, people do care.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.820]   But I think people in Washington and New York
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.140]   assume that most people are thinking about them
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.420]   far more than they are.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.260]   - I agree.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.680]   - And in the business that I was,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.200]   I remember thinking that what Congressman so-and-so
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.760]   just said in the hallways of Congress
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.700]   was the most important thing.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.900]   And I had to get it out immediately
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.640]   and it was gonna change the world.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.300]   And I realized, oh, people consume a lot slower
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.240]   than they do when you're in the belly of the beast,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.540]   so to speak.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.440]   But no, I think you might find that people
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.080]   are living two separate lives.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   But you'll find that even though the noise
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.880]   is all about what is happening in the West Wing
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.400]   or in Washington right now,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.500]   that seems like all that's going on in the country,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.480]   there is so much more going on in the country.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.800]   A lot of the cities around the country
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.880]   that people might not have given a lot of credit to
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.720]   in the past 30 or 40 years are really blossoming
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.640]   and coming into becoming real centers of culture and art.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.440]   And places beyond just New York City
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.480]   are really exciting places to live with exciting people.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.360]   And that might be news to some people back east,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.200]   but it's so true.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.320]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.400]   Last comment on just the influence.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.480]   I ran the numbers one time on,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.800]   I was looking at the viewership for the cable news channels
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.360]   and it seems like the cable news channels
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.040]   seemingly drive all the conversation.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.760]   Everyone's always either talking about
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.720]   what just got reported on the cable news channels
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.800]   on whichever side of the political spectrum.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.960]   I looked at it and I said,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.980]   with the exception of a few big shows,
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.800]   which might have a million or two million people,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   you know, a big Fox News show or something like that,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   the average audience for a cable news channel
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   is under half a million people.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.040]   And yet this under half a million people,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   they're not sitting and watching it currently,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.160]   it's just on in the background.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.920]   So Nielsen's scraping the fact that it's on,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.040]   but they're not necessarily paying total attention to it.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   In a nation of 300 million people,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.340]   that's really not that much of an impact.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.740]   Most people just don't care about the news.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.960]   Most people don't care about what,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   all of that stuff that's self-importance.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.100]   But when I'm in the middle of it,
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.200]   I think it's all that matters.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.980]   And you've been far more in the middle of it than I have.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.920]   And only getting out of it
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.000]   and completely walking away from it have I seen,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.080]   listen, it's not that important.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.120]   The crisis of the day is not the most important thing.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.520]   So I agree with you.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.080]   Now, I wanna talk about a number of different areas
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.520]   and try to speak practically about our observations.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.400]   And I brought you here to balance me out
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.080]   'cause I have a tendency to be more negative
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.120]   probably than is warranted.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.080]   I struggle with this question of optimism or pessimism
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.160]   because I think that optimism is always a logical solution.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.780]   If we look and analyze,
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.200]   life is getting better in general for most of us
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.680]   on most every metric in general.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.000]   If you look at the course of the history of world,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.480]   millions of people are coming out of poverty,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.960]   things are getting better.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.600]   It's just hard for us to recognize it
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.620]   because we don't understand what it was like a decade ago.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.400]   And we're so caught up in the crisis of the day
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.240]   that we don't see the macro trends.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.320]   So I think that the logical position is to be optimistic.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.040]   But I also observe and see that things have changed.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.020]   I don't know what your reading has been like
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.860]   while you've been on the road,
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.060]   but the most influential book I read in 2018
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.660]   was a book called "The Silk Road."
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.060]   And the author, or "The Silk Road,"
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.460]   the author was a historian
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.620]   and he traced the history of the world
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.500]   in this about 500 pages.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.460]   And it was fascinating
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.260]   because of course he was touching on basic things.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.180]   But what I saw was that the history of the world
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.460]   is constantly a history of problems.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.260]   And figuring out how to bring together this macro trend
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.300]   while being realistic with the micro trends,
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.740]   I find it impossible.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.180]   And I don't know how to do it,
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.100]   especially as looking at the United States.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.940]   - I think you just look at the data
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.700]   over the long period of time,
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.780]   that the trajectory, despite a lot of hiccups,
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.880]   in terms of prosperity, health, is up.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.940]   And I think it's easy to feel pessimistic
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.220]   because we are met with a lot of noise
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.380]   that sounds very scary.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.380]   But we also are heading into this new year
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.940]   that is a year where there's more prosperity
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.980]   than there ever has been.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.260]   And I know that it's not maybe doled out, so to speak,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.180]   in a way that some people would appreciate it to be.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.860]   But I think the trend lines are going up.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.520]   We have access to more goods and services
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.000]   and there's more trade happening between nations
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.300]   than there ever has been before.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.380]   And with more trade comes more peace,
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.900]   not ultimate, not eternal peace, but some.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.140]   And so I can only be optimistic on a grand scale,
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.080]   but still go through the year being pessimistic
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.620]   about maybe the way that the culture is heading
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.940]   or the way that, the priorities the country is focusing on.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.700]   But in the long term, I can only feel good.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.340]   - When you traveled across all the corners of the country,
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.380]   did you observe one America?
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.080]   Did you observe two, multiple?
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.940]   How do you put together the fabric of this nation?
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.500]   - Less divided than we're given credit for.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.140]   The one thing that I found amazing and could not believe
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.060]   was, this is back when I was reading the news,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.620]   all the essays saying,
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.360]   we are the most divided we've ever been
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.020]   and we're heading for some kind of fracture, a civil war.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.060]   Y'all, everybody, most people are like pretty chill
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.060]   with their neighbors.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.380]   There was no sense that the people I was meeting
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.820]   or talking to of any kind were gearing up
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.560]   to get their muskets and pitchforks
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.800]   and heading for the hills to fight the civil war.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.180]   This was not in anyone's mind.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.640]   Like I said earlier, they're thinking about
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.660]   what their weekend plans are with their family
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.480]   and the idea of no one has the effort to go forth
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.320]   and fight a civil war.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.680]   Like this is not a thing in people's minds.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.240]   I think it's a thing for those who live their life
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.080]   through Twitter.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.140]   And as a person who used to do that,
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.920]   it's easy to think that twitter.com
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.400]   is the only universe that exists.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.440]   It's right in your face.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.080]   It's there throughout all of your day.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.280]   The morning you wake up
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.680]   and then when you go to bed at night,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.660]   but that is not the world.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.600]   But it seemed like the people writing those essays
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   were living in that universe.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.160]   You just gotta take a deep breath and step back
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.440]   and realize that that is not happening.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.280]   That is not.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.960]   So that's the biggest, I think, myth that I saw.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.180]   It's not nearly as divided.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.660]   On policy, yes, absolutely.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.360]   And we're about to go through another presidential
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.400]   election cycle and it's gonna be wild
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.640]   and it's gonna be crazy.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.480]   And I would recommend any listener
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.880]   to just consume your media wisely.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.240]   Do it in a controlled fashion.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.880]   Don't let it control your entire day.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.000]   Take a half hour a day to read the news
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.200]   and then that's it.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.220]   - Right, right.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.800]   So when I look at the country,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.040]   I agree with you in terms of generally.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.000]   I think there's a lot less fracturing
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.220]   of what it means to be an American.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.280]   I think, in general, if you look at wars,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.040]   the politicians declare wars,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.400]   but normal people don't go to war.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.800]   They don't wanna go to war.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.280]   If the people who actually go to war
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   were the ones that would vote for it,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.320]   we wouldn't be in any wars.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.640]   But it's the politicians that go to war
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.920]   and they send everyone else's kids off to war.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.100]   And I think, to me, that just seems generally true
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.340]   in most countries, most places in the world and most wars.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.760]   But I do think that there's a lot happening economically.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.360]   I think there's a pretty significant divide
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.040]   happening economically.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.520]   And it's all across the country.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.960]   There are different discussions of it.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.520]   Some people talk about it at the coasts
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.780]   versus the interior.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.000]   A lot of discussion can be made
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.640]   of the city versus the country.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.420]   You can talk about it on the level of academic achievement.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.480]   But it seems to me that there are a lot of people
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.880]   who are really doing well
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.920]   and a lot of people who are really struggling.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.480]   And the rich are getting richer
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.760]   and the poor are getting poorer.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.960]   And that seems to be challenging to figure out,
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.480]   how do we fix this?
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.360]   What were your observations economically?
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.760]   - Well, over the past five years,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.440]   I'd say we've gotten very used
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.000]   to looking at the stock market
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.920]   and it going up, up, up, up.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.060]   And that makes it really exciting for us
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.880]   to log on to whatever our bank account is
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.360]   where we have our stock brokerages
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.040]   and look at the trend line going up.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.840]   And so we might've gotten into the habit
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.380]   of checking it every day.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.680]   And in the next year ahead or the next few years,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.000]   I'm no prognosticator,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.360]   but maybe it won't be so.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.320]   Maybe it won't only go up.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.040]   So while we've gotten used to checking it all day,
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.440]   it might not be nearly as fun.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.480]   And that might, talking about short-term pessimism,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.640]   really get us down.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.900]   And I think it's important for people to,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.740]   in this time of uncertainty,
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.160]   look back at your long-term plan
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.800]   and make sure you're comfortable and confident in it,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.660]   and then rest your hope on that
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.080]   and not on your daily habit of checking the stock market.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.920]   But to your question about the divide,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.700]   I think the data are showing
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.440]   that while there is divides in certain areas,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.000]   poor people that are in poverty,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.160]   still the standard of living is increasing.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.880]   - And so I would still say that it's still,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.680]   people are doing better year after year.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.520]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.360]   And so the classic argument, which I would affirm,
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.320]   is what matters is not so much the difference
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.480]   between the rich and the poor,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   in terms of the nominal difference.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.320]   What matters is what is the standard of living.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.580]   And so the poorest among us today,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.840]   even on a global basis, the poorest among us today
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.940]   are richer than we've ever been.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.680]   Which brings me to my big concern.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.560]   And I sometimes question, Chris,
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.480]   if I'm just too much of a pessimist.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.300]   I certainly do.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.560]   But when I look at it culturally,
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.680]   one of my biggest concerns culturally
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   is I see us feeding greed and covetousness
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.880]   in the culture and envy.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.080]   The besetting sins of the US American culture
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.800]   that I would say right now are primarily those three,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   which are all together, covetousness, greed, and envy.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.240]   And we seem to be, in my observation,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.240]   just indulging this very dangerous idea of saying,
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.240]   well, let's take from other people.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.640]   And we seem to have become a culture of takers,
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.360]   rather than a culture of people
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.720]   who recognize the opportunities we have
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.680]   and want to engage in those.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.380]   We've become much more focused on our jealousy
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.420]   of what our neighbor has,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.000]   and how can we get some of it for us, get me some,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   rather than how can we produce something
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.560]   that our neighbor might wanna buy from us.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.260]   - I think you hit on something very important
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.080]   about covetousness and envy.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.400]   I think we're reaching an envy epidemic right now.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   And I think the access to constant use of smartphones
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.600]   is having something to do with this,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.960]   where people are spending their entire day mixing,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.360]   looking at what everyone else is doing,
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.920]   and then expressing their best live on Instagram
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.700]   or Facebook, and then feeling envious of it.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.320]   Has this ever happened to you?
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.600]   You just spent the most amazing day with your family
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.280]   where you took an adventure climbing a mountain
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.140]   or having a picnic,
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.840]   and it was just so pleasant and beautiful.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.640]   And then at the end of the Sunday evening,
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.600]   you check Instagram and you see somebody else
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.960]   had a good time, and then you feel bad
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.360]   about them having maybe a better time than you have.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.200]   We do that.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.360]   And you mix that with the constant access
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.200]   of online shopping.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.600]   I think we are seeing a time
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.120]   when people are living lives of envy,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.840]   and that is poison.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.800]   And I hope people are becoming more aware
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.280]   that they need to put up barriers,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.960]   just like you did on your phone,
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.860]   to protect themselves from these feelings.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.600]   'Cause these are very base human feelings.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.680]   There's a reason why ancient ethical
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.280]   and religious codes mentioned it.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.260]   - Right, right. (laughs)
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   - Like the big ones, the 10 commandments.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.700]   Because the people from 3,000 years ago
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.180]   were dealing with the same stuff we are,
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.340]   and this is not going to go away and not change.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.300]   - Right, right.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.020]   But I get concerned about what that's doing
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.620]   in people's lives.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.380]   I fear it's leading, especially,
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.560]   so here's what I see.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.980]   And I think there's good sociological data to this.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.540]   The book that, probably my book of the year in 2017,
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.060]   was I read Charles Murray's book, "Coming Apart."
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.300]   It was called "Coming Apart, the State of White America,"
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.700]   from 1960 to 2010.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.740]   - 10.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.900]   - And in that book, Murray posited the argument
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   that, in essence, there are two brand new social classes
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.660]   in the United States of America.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.100]   An upper class elite that had never before existed
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.220]   in the United States of America,
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.140]   and that upper class elite was not measured
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.180]   in terms of nominal wealth,
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.500]   because there'd always been rich people in the United States,
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.100]   but rather it was measured in terms of a cultural,
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.900]   a distinctive culture, an elite culture,
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.980]   which may or may not come with wealth.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.220]   And then he also posited that there was a new lower class
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.220]   that had been built.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.140]   Again, not in terms of poverty,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.940]   but in terms of a distinctive lower class culture.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.980]   And that this was the change from 1960 to 2010
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.060]   that was marked in US American society.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.500]   And what I was, frankly, horrified to discover
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.260]   was that I am part of the upper class elite.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.780]   I always thought I was a common man.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.660]   And then I read his book and I took his test
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.500]   and I was shocked to find out that, wait a second.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.260]   - You were in the bubble, as it were.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.340]   - I was in the bubble.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.620]   And that was sobering to me,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.060]   because I've always prided myself
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:03.940]   of not being in the bubble.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.500]   I've always tried to be exposed to other things,
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.900]   but I was squarely in the bubble, my wife too.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.460]   And then I realized how in the bubble that we really were.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.260]   But I've seen this expressed more and more.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.420]   And let me give you just an example from my history.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.220]   When I was in college, I spent some time in Nicaragua,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.500]   which is the second, or at least was at the time,
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.260]   the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.380]   Haiti, of course, being the poorest.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.180]   Nicaragua, basically at the time,
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.020]   had six and a half million inhabitants,
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.780]   six million of which were desperately poor
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.300]   and half a million of which were desperately rich.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.860]   And just a massive caste system in terms of wealth.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.540]   And I stayed with this family for a week out in the Campo.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.340]   And it was a nice enough house
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.020]   compared to the rest of the village.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.180]   We had concrete walls, but we had dirt floors.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.340]   And it was very basic.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.980]   And many of the houses in the village,
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.540]   dirt floors, rusty tin roofs,
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.500]   walls that you could see through.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.420]   We had a latrine.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.100]   We poured a bucket of water over our heads for a shower.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.740]   Extremely basic.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.140]   And I would wake up in the morning with chickens
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.500]   under my bed.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.620]   They would come in and scratch around
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.140]   on the floor in the living room.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.580]   And I watched every night.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.740]   I watched the Nicaraguan family I was staying with.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.020]   They had, I think, five or six children.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.260]   I watched them sit and watch telenovelas
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.100]   for about three or four hours,
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.060]   which were coming from Buenos Aires,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.820]   from all of the rich cosmopolitan cities.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.060]   And I'd watch them sit there
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.660]   and watch these telenovelas for hours.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.100]   And here we are sitting in plastic porch chairs,
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.020]   which is what the world's poor sit in,
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.700]   in a dirt hut, watching telenovelas
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.900]   from the upper class high rise.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.220]   And I thought, this is so destructive.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.340]   This is utterly destructive.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.540]   Because instead of these people actually doing something
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.980]   or having the time to do it,
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.060]   they're sucked into this entertainment culture
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.300]   that's all about things that are completely unattainable.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.380]   And yet the same thing I see happening today.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.660]   And so I stand in line in poor areas of the United States,
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.140]   where you can see that poverty
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.220]   is very, very evident all around.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.220]   And there everyone is flipping on Instagram,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.620]   next, next, next, celebrity this, celebrity that,
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.540]   things that are totally unattainable.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.900]   And it's really troubling to me
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.340]   because I don't see how, without a cultural transformation,
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.180]   which I think has to start at the base,
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.660]   I don't see how that leads to good things.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.820]   I don't know how to fix that.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.740]   - Well, I think with the divide,
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.940]   you're talking about, as you put it, an elite divide.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.940]   And I think we saw a lot of evidence of that frustration
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.780]   in the 2016 election.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.620]   - Absolutely.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.420]   - Where people did not feel listened to.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.900]   They did not feel that their views were put,
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.140]   at least cast in the way that they thought that they meant,
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.580]   or at least misinterpreted, you know.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.380]   But they felt like they were not being represented properly
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.940]   in the culture centers of the country,
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.820]   in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, right?
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.940]   And I think that there was so much frustration about that,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.940]   that for some people is why they voted the way that they did
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.660]   and then expressed themselves in the way that they have
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.380]   over the past couple of years.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.700]   - Right, right.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.500]   So what do you see happening, kind of just culturally,
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.060]   or socially, or religiously?
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.860]   Or these, 'cause I struggle to talk about economics,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.300]   'cause I think economics is downstream
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.460]   of culture, in a sense.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.900]   First of all, I don't think you can compare economics
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.740]   to the stock market, because most people don't own stocks.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.700]   The average person just simply doesn't own stocks.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.940]   And so you can't look and say,
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.220]   well, the stock market is doing well,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.780]   so that automatically is indicative of the economy.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.180]   They are related, but they're not directly related.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.460]   I think the stock market has a much bigger influence
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.940]   on the elite, the wealthy elite who own stocks,
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.480]   rather than on the majority of the US American population.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.260]   But I do think economically, you can, of course,
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.660]   look at things like employment,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.860]   you can look at things like wealth, et cetera,
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.140]   and those are important.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.340]   But that's downstream of, in my opinion,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.800]   culture, of what's happening in a person's life.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.780]   'Cause today, I defend, without reservation,
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.620]   that if you are willing to work hard,
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.300]   you can get a job, you can earn plenty of money,
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.300]   and you can become wealthy.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.900]   There is nothing standing in the way of you,
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.500]   in the sense of if you have the character
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.540]   to do those things.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.540]   I talk to people all the time, employers, business owners,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.200]   they cannot find good help.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.900]   They can't find people who will show up to work on time,
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.060]   not be drunk or high when they get there,
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.660]   and will do the job that they're told to do.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.620]   If you just do that, then you have opportunity.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.300]   And then once you're earning income,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.780]   it's never been cheaper in some ways, on some measurements,
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.420]   never been cheaper, easier to live cheaper.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.940]   I mean, here you are living in a van.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.580]   Anybody could live in a van.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.140]   You can buy most of the things in life very inexpensively.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.300]   You can have access to things that the kings of the world
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.340]   didn't have access to.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.220]   - You're being so optimistic, Josh.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.820]   - Right, well, here's my point for pessimism.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.620]   The problem is, you have to have character.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.260]   You have to have, I don't know what other word,
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.180]   you have to have some get up and go.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   And if you're sitting around, you know,
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.620]   smoking weed in a hovel,
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.160]   thrilled with the fact that now marijuana is legal,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.160]   so that you can sit back and destroy any kind of energy
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.900]   that you can put towards your life, how do we,
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.700]   I don't see how you get there
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.700]   without a cultural transformation.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.900]   And I look at that, and that's where I see the weakness.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.540]   The social fabric, the cultural fabric,
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.460]   to me seems very thin at the moment.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.300]   - So one thing that I've seen is people spending a lot
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.620]   of their time focusing on stuff that's happening
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.780]   in Washington, and sometimes not as much
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.580]   that's happening in their living room.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.500]   - Right.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.780]   - And I think this is a very easy thing.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.620]   You can find out, do you spend more time reading
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.860]   or thinking about something happening thousands of miles
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.580]   away in the federal city, or in your home?
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.940]   And if the answer is in Washington,
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.540]   and you're not working in politics,
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.300]   well, maybe you need to think, have a readjustment of that.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.200]   And I would hope that people can focus more
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.580]   on the things over which they do have control.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.300]   And I'm not talking about local politics,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.500]   I'm talking about micro things like themselves,
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.760]   and then their family, and then their community,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.180]   just beyond that.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.820]   And spending more time working on those
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.320]   than thinking about the upcoming election.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:28.740]   People spend a lot, major forces spend a lot of money
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.060]   getting you to want to think about politics a lot,
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.180]   and about elections.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.500]   And it takes a lot to kind of resist that.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.740]   There's a heavy advertising machine,
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.980]   not just for products, but for politics as well.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.420]   - So I hope the same thing.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.240]   - Yeah, but--
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.080]   - I hope the same thing.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.900]   - Right, right.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.820]   - But my question is, are people doing that?
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.820]   - I'm worried, given the power of media these days,
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.120]   in that it's not only in your living room now,
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.460]   but it's also in your pocket, and in your bedroom,
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.900]   and in your bathroom, and wherever else you want to take it.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.080]   These are incredibly powerful forces,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.220]   where people spend, as I said,
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.780]   a lot of money going for your attention.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.180]   And I don't know, in the near term,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.600]   that people are going to be able to resist those forces.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.660]   I know that they are not right now.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.400]   But, as I've come kind of back into society
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.740]   for the holidays, I have noticed,
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.740]   while listening to the radio,
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.680]   or watching television for the first time,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.020]   people starting to feel a bit of uneasiness
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.020]   about the power it has over them.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.360]   And thinking, at least in the beginning stages,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.220]   of thinking how they can take back some of their time,
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.100]   and not be controlled by these forces.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.620]   But I don't see a big cultural shift
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.200]   happening anytime soon, which does worry me.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.380]   I think we'll be more led by external cultural forces
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.920]   that we bring into our homes,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.660]   than the power of our home culture transforming the outside.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.220]   So there's my short-term pessimism.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.640]   - Here's a piece of data in favor of what you're saying.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.960]   You, of course, wouldn't have seen it,
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.980]   because you were living in the woods under a rock.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.780]   But a few months ago, there was a series of articles
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.160]   in the New York Times, and it was talking about
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.660]   smartphone culture in Silicon Valley.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.140]   And basically, the most anti-smartphone place
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.180]   has become Silicon Valley.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.300]   And it's good reporting, I should find the articles for you,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.860]   because you would read them, you should read them.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.300]   But it even went so far to talk about how
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:27.300]   the Silicon Valley parents have virtually a spy network,
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.700]   where they spy on one another's nannies.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.060]   And one of the things that now, mothers and fathers,
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.740]   who are working in Silicon Valley at the big tech companies,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.540]   they hire nannies to take care of their children,
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.040]   and they have their nannies sign a contract
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.640]   that the nanny is forbidden from looking at her smartphone
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.100]   while she's at work.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.820]   And so then, if somebody's at the park,
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.420]   and they see a nanny pushing the kids on the swing,
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.740]   and the nanny's using the phone,
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.500]   they'll take pictures of it, and they have message boards
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.460]   among the mothers and fathers there about,
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.220]   whose nanny is this, I saw them on their phone, et cetera.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.740]   And so if you look at, Melinda Gates has been quoted
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.340]   as saying, "I wish we had waited longer
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.740]   "to expose our children to technical devices."
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.180]   Steve Jobs famously didn't permit devices for his children
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.700]   for some period of time.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.580]   And several other big names in tech,
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.100]   who basically all kind of narrowed down.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.840]   And so, and then similar things on classrooms.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.420]   What you see is in Silicon Valley,
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.340]   as reported in the series of articles by the New York Times,
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.660]   we see Silicon Valley is a press away
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.380]   from computerized classroom teaching.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.540]   And so you see a much more of a turning away from screens,
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.060]   getting children off of screens,
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.740]   using other forms of education.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.780]   But simultaneously, Google and Apple
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.600]   are both constantly trying to get Chromebooks and iPads
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.980]   into every school, and trying to get every single student
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.520]   on their platforms, and the whole idea is,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.900]   we're gonna go with this virtual education.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.860]   Everybody thought, what would be the rich people
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.260]   who have computers, and the poor people who don't,
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.840]   but it's turned into the exact opposite.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.500]   The poor people's children are being raised
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.620]   by their smartphones, and the rich people's children
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.820]   are being raised by actual teachers.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.220]   And so there is a piece of data to your thesis,
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.740]   but this is what adds to my concern,
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.040]   because I don't see how,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.660]   Chris, I've become such a curmudgeon, it's so bad.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.940]   But I don't like to be critical of people,
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.260]   but you can't go out to dinner
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.400]   and find children talking to their parents.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.100]   - Right, yeah.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.540]   - What kind of world are my children gonna live in
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.740]   when children, when their peers don't know
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.180]   how to talk to their parents?
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.980]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.780]   It's a real concern, and you have to set the boundaries
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.820]   in your home for this to work at all.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.320]   No one is going to legislate this, and they shouldn't.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.020]   But, you know, this is what I mean when I say
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.020]   people need to turn more inward to their home culture
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.500]   than turning outward and just bringing the culture in
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.980]   and letting them babysit their children that way.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.740]   I have since, you know, if you read the new book
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.140]   called "iGen," you know, it talks about the generation
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.100]   that comes after the millennials.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.820]   And, you know, the data is still rolling in every day,
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.500]   but it makes me very nervous, you know, about the future.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.100]   And that is a very, like, old man yelling at cloud thing
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.500]   to say. - Of course.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.180]   - Although, if I could say one positive thing,
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.940]   Generation X, I think, is maybe the greatest generation
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.360]   of our time, 'cause they're the only ones, like,
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.020]   not whining or not doing disastrous things
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.500]   and going to work and making the country run.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.740]   I am not Gen X.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.220]   I am a millennial, but I have great respect
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.820]   for the Generation X.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.660]   - Hold on, my son is crawling on a table.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.180]   Hold on. (laughs)
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.900]   Child crisis averted.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.880]   I guess, kind of in summary, Chris,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.520]   I was hoping when I went on my walkabout,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.300]   I was hoping to come to some conclusion
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.660]   about the future of the country.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.780]   I was hoping to come to some conclusion
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.140]   about, you know, positivity or negativity.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.380]   And I know that it's naive to think
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.020]   that it would be all one way or the other.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.600]   Obviously, that's naive.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.100]   Life is not so simple.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.740]   Life is a combination of things together.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.780]   And there's always gonna be advances and declines,
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.920]   and those things are gonna come and go.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.480]   Just don't know what to make of it.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.500]   I still don't.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.340]   I didn't come to any conclusions.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.220]   I didn't come to, the only conclusion I came to,
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.080]   I guess I could say this.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.640]   The conclusion that I came to was,
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.980]   you can create a positive, successful environment
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.460]   in your own microclimate, so to speak, in your own area.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:31.460]   And frankly, my biggest concerns is the cultural,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:36.460]   the declining culture.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.660]   And specifically, I mean, marriage, family formation,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.020]   which leads to success.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.940]   Because with the attacks that marriage run,
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.460]   or these things have long-term effects,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.920]   and they have long-term financial effects as well.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.980]   We could get into that data, but of course,
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.260]   we don't have it at our fingertips.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.920]   But I see it happening all around.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.020]   And what I observe is,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.120]   with the increasing angst about politics,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.020]   perhaps it's just the coastal elites
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.660]   who live and breathe in this world.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.100]   But basically, what I see many of my peers doing
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.420]   is because we've walked away from the areas
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.420]   where we can actually make a difference,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.540]   we spend our time arguing about things
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.420]   we can't make a difference,
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.560]   and that just leads to depression.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.820]   So, like, I'm the king of my castle.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.500]   I can make a difference in my castle.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.660]   I don't have to ask anybody.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.460]   I don't have to apply for a license.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.140]   I have my wife, and I have my children,
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.980]   and I can make a difference there.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.400]   And that difference will ripple throughout
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.060]   the coming centuries in terms of what I do.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.420]   So far be it from me,
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.780]   it would be what a disaster for me to waste my time
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.700]   arguing with people online about things that I can't change,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.300]   and thus ignoring the needs of my own children.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.020]   And yet, and the same thing in my neighborhood.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.300]   I can make a difference in my neighborhood.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.460]   I can make a difference in my business.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.060]   I can make a difference in my job.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.540]   I cannot make a difference on who the next president
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.100]   of the United States is gonna be.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.520]   And so, I observe that that's the only solution
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.540]   I have found, is to walk away from that nightmare
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.940]   and to focus on loving my wife, loving my children,
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.380]   and loving my neighbor,
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.780]   and building the local community that can endure.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.460]   Because that local community is what will build
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.540]   the fabric of the next generation.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.820]   That local community is what will build the fabric
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.300]   of my neighbors and their success, their stability.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   And I can't go across the country and say to
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.260]   all those millions of people what I think they should do
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.140]   if I haven't even gone across the fence
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.740]   to my next door neighbor and said,
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.700]   "How can I serve you?
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.260]   "How can I help you?"
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.100]   That's the only solution I've come to.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.420]   - Well, I think a lot of people could gain a lot
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.980]   by coming to that solution as well.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.820]   Look, I don't mean to say that everybody should
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.140]   completely opt out of reading the news.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.820]   I did it as a personal experiment,
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.260]   and now I can bring it back into my life
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.580]   in a more healthful way.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.180]   But I think we can change our relationship
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.100]   with the national political scene,
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.300]   and not let it dominate us so much.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   And that gives us more time to focus on the things
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.540]   over which we do have control, like you just said.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.340]   And I think that would be, at least for me personally,
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.660]   one of the biggest takeaways from my trip
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.060]   would have been actually very similar to what you described.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.060]   But when I was in the fury of it all, in the other world,
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:33.460]   I didn't give myself the time to think and realize that.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.580]   And I'm grateful for the experience.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.340]   And I hope other people can come to that conclusion as well,
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.300]   and start thinking about ways that they can set up systems
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.180]   that'll allow them to focus on what is more important.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.540]   I really hope people in the next year
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.940]   begin to start thinking about these things,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.660]   and practicing them in their daily life.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.100]   But I do think it's going to be a long, tough road
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.540]   with moments of great reckoning that might be painful.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.580]   And it might feel like a couple steps forward
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.540]   of more steps back.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.940]   But darn it, I'm still gonna be optimistic
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.140]   that we are going to come out of these uncertain
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.940]   and strange times, learn from it,
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.340]   and hopefully build better communities.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.780]   But I know that sounds kind of hokey.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.260]   I know it does, but I can't help it.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.100]   - Here's what I observed.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:22.940]   It does sound hokey.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.300]   - I'm sorry if you--
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.380]   - It's funny, if you look at so many people
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.860]   who study the problems from so many perspectives,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.780]   people arrive at common solutions, and this is one of them.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.940]   There are people from every background
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.700]   who basically arrive at these common solutions.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.540]   I'm gonna ask you a closing question,
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.540]   and just give you a chance to talk about
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.740]   your trip in this way.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.260]   I think one of the most useful things
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.540]   that we could encourage people to do
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.380]   is from time to time to take a sabbatical.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.300]   I believe that the concept of retirement,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.460]   as in work for 40 years,
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.740]   and then retire and play golf for 30 years,
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.660]   is broken because it doesn't, it's broken.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.740]   It was a conspiracy foisted upon the poor
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.460]   by those who were trying to reduce the unemployment numbers.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.700]   But the concept of sabbatical, I think, is so valuable.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   Work a project for a number of years,
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.940]   be it five, seven, eight, nine, 10 years, whatever,
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.140]   and then take a sabbatical.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.460]   Take a year off, take two years, take six months,
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.020]   and do something different.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.900]   And when you go back to it,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.140]   you'll go back to something new, something productive.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.220]   Instead of sitting around playing golf for 30 years,
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.660]   you'll go back to something productive.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.340]   - But to go with a renewed energy, vigor, focus, et cetera.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.820]   That's what I've seen that you've done.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.380]   What is your comment after having been on a sabbatical?
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.460]   - Well, I would say that doing something like this
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.500]   is not possible for everybody,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.220]   and I wouldn't be so privileged as to think that,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.060]   oh, couldn't anybody just take time off?
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.380]   You can, you just have to work very hard to build systems
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.440]   that are beyond the big system,
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.500]   and it's incredibly difficult to do that.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.380]   That said, one thing people can do
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.460]   is take the concept of Sabbath
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.300]   on a more micro level more seriously.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.020]   Anything from an entire day
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.580]   to just having micro Sabbaths during your day.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.600]   For example, used to be,
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.820]   we would take micro Sabbaths all the time.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.100]   And what I mean by that is a bike ride
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.580]   with your girlfriend or boyfriend or your wife,
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.900]   or an afternoon picnic with your family.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.060]   When you would leave your house
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.180]   in the age before cell phones and everything,
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.560]   you were completely off grid during that time.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.100]   And that is no longer the case.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.500]   You are still opening yourself up to interruptions.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.340]   And I don't know about you,
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.660]   but if I'm interrupted,
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.460]   if my headspace is not where I am,
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.500]   then I'm not there anymore.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.660]   I'm gone into the phone or into the news or whatever.
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.460]   And so to your point,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.380]   I would encourage people that if they can't take
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.380]   a real sabbatical to take micro Sabbaths during their day,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.680]   when they are truly with the people they love
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.360]   or alone in solitude,
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.180]   and taking back that time for themselves
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.560]   in a way that we did only a couple of years ago.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.100]   And I think you will find a profound difference
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.040]   in the way that you perceive the world
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.200]   and you're refreshed enough to be able to tackle
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.160]   the hard things that are demanded of us in the future.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.860]   - So you've gone around interviewing people
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.320]   who are opting out.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.280]   What story or what person that you've interacted with
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.760]   so far has really stuck with you and made you think?
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.720]   - One of the first groups of people we met
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.320]   that are known in the personal finance community,
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.680]   the Frugalwoods family up in Vermont.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.440]   A lot of people know them, they've heard of them.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.120]   They saved a large percentage of their income
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.120]   and then semi-retired to a pastoral life in Vermont
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.480]   in the way they wanted to live,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.800]   where they made the terms of their life.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.040]   What they did took an incredible amount of work,
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.920]   but it also took a lot of bravery in stepping out
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.160]   and saying, "We are not going to live
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.420]   as everyone tells us to live.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.240]   We're going to do what we're going to do.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.160]   And there may be consequences to that, but we don't care."
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.760]   And the fact that they fashioned the life
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   that they wanted to build, and everyone's dream is different,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.680]   but they were able to do it because they had the discipline
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.000]   and then went ahead and did it themselves.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.360]   And I would say that they're a phenomenal example
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.880]   of what any normal person could do
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.520]   if, first of all, you know your goals,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.040]   but then work very diligently every single day
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.680]   to reach them both in a micro and a macro level.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.640]   - I look forward to reading the book
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.740]   when you finish writing it.

[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.840]   - That's right, yes.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.640]   - So I've been enjoying watching you there,
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.160]   and I look forward to hearing what's next
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.200]   for you and Christy.

[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.760]   - Thank you for having me on.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.240]   - Don't just dream about paradise.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.360]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
