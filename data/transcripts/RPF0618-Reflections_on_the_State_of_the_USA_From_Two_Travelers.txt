[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:23.220]   and that is a better than Pearl Advisor and that is a better than Pearl Advisor and the other people so for example, not to be vague, but for example, we would not have any device use beyond the threshold of the door in the apartment and when we were home together we were present and home together and we would live this kind of quiet log cabin existence in the middle of Manhattan while we were home and that is really the way we were heading and it just so happens that we ended up taking it into an extreme level by living in the woods in a van for nine months.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:52.500]  , and that is really the way we were heading and it just so happens that we ended up taking it into an extreme level by living in the woods in a van for nine months.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:21.780]   So you have that natural bent or cultivated vent probably to asking questions and learning people's stories. You've traveled all four corners of the country over the last six months. We've traveled a good portion of the country and one of my main reasons for going out and traveling in addition to personal reasons was to get a sense of what's happening in the United States of America. One of the big challenges for me in building Radical Personal Finance is I no longer have a water cooler or a coffee pot to talk to people.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:51.060]  , and it's very easy for me in a normal week to sit in front of my computer and all of my work is solitary. I don't work physically with any coworkers. I just sit in front of my computer and I get together with a few personal friends and some church friends and that's about it as far as my in-person interaction. And what I have learned is that's very dangerous for me because then it leaves me trying to form my understanding of what's happening in the world from Twitter.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:20.340]  , or from YouTube or from NewYorkTimes.com or whatever those kinds of things are and I've struggled to maintain a grip on reality without having coworkers to talk to at the coffee pot. And so today we're going to talk about what's happening in the country and you and I have both been out traveling getting a sense of what's happening. My question for you is what you've observed over the last six months a surprise to you? Is the world about you?
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.080]   Is the world about you?
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   Is the world about you?
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   I'm not sure if that's how you thought it was when you were living in Manhattan or is it very different?
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   The short answer is no I learned a lot first of all let me set the scene of how I we lived. So part of this experience I almost think completely opted out of any exposure to media. I have not read the news in months, although I found I'm exposed to information people just tell me things. I don't feel less informed but I used to read the news on a moment to moment basis and I were reporting reporting the news
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   I was reporting the news.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   You were reporting the news.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   I was reporting the news.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   That used to be the news.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   Well it's not that I was not.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:06:19.240]   or

[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.640]   about politics. That was my job.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.760]   What do you think of Trump?
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.840]   What do you think of Hillary Clinton?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.000]   What do you think of what's going on?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.300]   Well, going out on my own really gave me an opportunity
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   to not ask those questions and see what people say.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.180]   In nine months, no one brought up politics once.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.720]   And I talked to a lot of people.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.140]   Really?
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.960]   I let them guide the conversation.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.280]   Right.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.180]   Not a single person mentioned what was going on in Washington.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   Now, they might have just been polite,
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   They're not going to be able to tell you what's going on in Washington.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   They're not going to be able to tell you what's going on in Washington.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   They're not going to be able to tell you what's going on in Washington.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   They're not going to be able to tell you what's going on in Washington.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:08:15.840]  , because I was new.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:15.920]   But I spent a good amount of time with people, maybe a series of days.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:15.980]   There is so much more to talk about.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.020]   And they have an interest in talking about it, but it didn't have anything to do what was in the newspaper.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.120]   And I found that phenomenally refreshing, but also fascinating as well.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.180]   Right.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.180]   So, frankly, Chris, I don't know how to analyze this.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.240]   So, I also, when we were traveling, I also was very cut off from much of the media.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.520]   I've had massive problems disconnecting myself from my phone.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:17.580]   I've had massive problems disconnecting myself from my phone.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:17.780]   I've had massive problems disconnecting myself from my phone.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.120]   In order to get anything done, I'll tell you how extreme I've had to be.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.180]   In order to get anything done, I'll tell you how extreme I've had to be.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.280]   So, for years, I've taken off social media.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:18.380]   So, for years, I've taken off social media.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.580]   I used to be addicted to YouTube.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:18.680]   I used to be addicted to YouTube.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:18.980]   I took off YouTube.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.080]   I took off YouTube.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.180]   Then I took off all the social media apps.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.280]   Then I took off all the social media apps.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:31.320]   Then I took off all the social media apps.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   It got so bad that for me to get something done, I had to completely eliminate my browser, my web browser from my phone.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:47.640]   So, for the entirety of our traveling around the country, not once I didn't log on to Facebook.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:47.700]   So, for the entirety of our traveling around the country, not once I didn't log on to Facebook.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:47.780]   So, for the entirety of our traveling around the country, not once I didn't log on to Facebook.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:47.840]   I haven't logged on in eight months at this point.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:47.940]   I haven't logged on in eight months at this point.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.040]   I haven't logged on in eight months at this point.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.140]   I didn't log on to almost anything.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.220]   I didn't log on to almost anything.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.280]   I didn't log on to almost anything.

[00:08:48.920 --> 00:09:00.100]   like

[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:56.620]   No, people do care, but I think people in Washington and New York assume that most people are thinking about them far more than they are.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.620]   I agree.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:06.620]   And, you know, in the business that I was, I remember thinking that what Congressman so-and-so just said in the hallways of Congress was the most important thing and I had to get it out immediately and I was going to change the world.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620]   Right, right, right.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:15.140]   And I realized, oh, people consume a lot slower than they do when you're in the belly of the beast, so to speak.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.140]   . . .
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:25.000]   small

[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:12.820]   The

[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:12.820]   The

[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:12.820]   The
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.260]   renders the word "new" which means "new" in English.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.020]   The average audience for a cable news channel is under half a million people.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:19.660]   The average audience for a cable news channel is under half a million people.

[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:23.660]   The average audience for a cable news channel is under half a million people.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.300]   And yet, this under half a million people don't, they're not sitting and watching it currently.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.220]   It's just on in the background so Nielsen's scraping the fact that it's on, but they're not necessarily paying total attention to it.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.620]   In a nation of 300 million people, that's really not that much of an impact.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.940]   Most people just don't care about the news.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.660]   Most people don't care about what all of that subject matter is.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:41.660]   Most people just don't care about what all of that subject matter is.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:12:10.980]  , but when I'm in the middle of it, I think it's all that matters.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.220]   But when I'm in the middle of it, I think it's all that matters.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.540]   And you've been far more in the middle of it than I have, and only getting out of it and completely walking away from it, have I seen.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:11.620]   And only getting out of it and completely walking away from it, have I seen.

[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:11.620]   So I agree with you. Now, I want to talk about a number of different areas and try to speak practically about our observations.

[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.500]   I don't know what your reading has been like while you've been on the road, but the most influential book I read in 2018 was a book called Silk Road.

[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:20.940]   and I don't know how to do it, especially as looking at the United States.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:45.220]   I think you just look at the data over the long period of time that the trajectory, despite a lot of hiccups, in terms of prosperity, health is up.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.220]   I think you just look at the data over the long period of time that the trajectory, despite a lot of hiccups, in terms of prosperity, health is up.

[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.900]   And I think it's easy to feel pessimistic because we are met with a lot of noise that sounds very scary.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   And I think it's easy to feel pessimistic because we are met with a lot of noise that sounds very scary.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   But we also are heading into this new year that is a year where there's more prosperity than there ever has been.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   But we also are heading into this new year that is a year where there's more prosperity than there ever has been.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:14:13.100]   I think the trend lines are going up. We have access to more goods and services and there's more trade happening between nations than there ever has been before.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.100]   And with more trade comes more peace, not ultimate, not eternal peace, but some.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:20.860]   And so I can only be optimistic on a grand scale, but still go through the year being pessimistic about the future.

[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.340]   Absolutely.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:52.340]   And, and so, you know, I would still say that it's, it's still, you know, people are, are doing better year after year.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:19:18.380]  - Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.380]   And so, the, the classic argument, which I would affirm is the, what matters is not so much the difference between the rich and the poor in terms of the nominal difference.
