[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.280]   All right, moving on.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.640]   We got a question here from Andrew.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.240]   Andrew says, I'm starting a PhD.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.680]   How would you approach a PhD knowing what you know now
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.400]   regarding deep work, et cetera?
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.360]   Andrew, assuming you're looking for an academic job,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.160]   assuming that's why you're doing a PhD,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   care a lot more about the research topic right now.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.280]   When you're very new, you've got to think,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.240]   where is there heat right now just beginning
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.760]   to emerge in my field?
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.800]   And I want to be working on something like that
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.360]   with the best possible people who are
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.440]   helping to develop that field.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.840]   I underestimated this, I would say, in my PhD program.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.560]   I didn't think about it.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.120]   I just said, I'll deal with the job market
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.320]   when I deal with the job market.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.860]   But really what you want to be doing,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.520]   if your goal is to get an academic job,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.080]   is to say, I want to align myself
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.400]   with someone who's doing something very hot right now.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.900]   Because here's what's going to happen
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.320]   when I enter the job market.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.080]   They're going to say, we want whatever
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   your advisor's name is.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   And then the response will be, well, she's not available.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.600]   She already has a job.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.400]   They'll say, all right, well, can we
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.840]   get basically like a clone of this person who also
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.880]   knows how to do that work?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.360]   Like, great, who is her student?
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.840]   Let's get that person instead.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440]   That's where the really good job offers come from.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.640]   That's what opens up options.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.720]   So care a lot about what research you're working on.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.680]   And then get in the habit of working on research
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.760]   every single day.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.200]   I'm going to suggest the first three hours of every day.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.880]   The first three hours of every day,
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.160]   you're reading stuff relevant to a paper, article,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.040]   or essay you want to write, or you're directly writing
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.880]   a paper, article, or essay.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.600]   So three hours a day, every day, you're always doing work.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.760]   That adds up.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.240]   Produce, produce, produce.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.720]   OK, so align yourself with the hottest topic you can.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   Someone who's doing great work on a field that's emerging
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.440]   really makes such a difference.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.920]   We really underplay topic.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.480]   Research topic is so important on the job market.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.760]   It's not just, here's a generic talent.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.400]   It's like, we're hiring for this topic.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.480]   And then B, three hours, three hours every day.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.680]   And also, in your writing, don't do what I just did,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.120]   which was enumerated one, followed by B.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640]   That's the type of stuff that's not
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.160]   going to go well in your article for whatever academic journal.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.680]   All right.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.080]   He's getting his PhD in film studies.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.480]   And I was wondering what your thoughts on even
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.800]   on that film study kick with books and stuff.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.760]   Do a lot of people have PhDs in film studies?
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.640]   No, but it's a department at a lot of universities,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.760]   but not every university.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360]   So it's not as widespread as English or something.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.840]   But film studies is a great example.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.320]   I mean, basically, in film studies,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.360]   you need to be aligning yourself with an emerging framework
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.680]   or critique that seems to have a lot of heat around it,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.840]   is what I would say.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.080]   And then you need to start reading all that and writing
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.840]   in that as early as possible.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   Align yourself with someone who's
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.080]   doing really great work with that new framework
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.280]   or type of critique and master it.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.120]   And you've got to be doing reviews and essays
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.400]   pretty early on, is what I would say.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.200]   Yeah, film studies would be cool.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, I read that textbook.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.560]   It's a complicated field, man.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.880]   Yeah, that's why I was curious.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.840]   Yeah, it's all complicated.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.360]   I mean, it's like any other field, I think, right now.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   So there's theoretical frameworks that get popular,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.720]   and then they infuse lots of different fields.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   Like film studies is very susceptible to that.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.160]   So whatever is big at the time-- so if we were talking 15 years
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.200]   ago, you're going to get a lot of post-colonial theory
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   or queer theory.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.720]   And now there's a lot more specifically
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   postmodern critical theory subsets
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.560]   that are really injecting themselves through film study.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.920]   So probably what you should do in film studies
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.040]   is look to an emerging theoretical framework that's
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.320]   generating a lot of heat in another major field that
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.840]   hasn't yet made it to film studies
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   or is just making it there, and then be one of the people
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.200]   that helps usher it in.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.120]   That's a pretty sure path to academic jobs.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.840]   All right, Andrew.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
