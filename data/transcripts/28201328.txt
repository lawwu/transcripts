[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Welcome, friends, to this episode
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.160]   of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.920]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.500]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.180]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.040]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.440]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.660]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.760]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.760]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.880]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.400]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.840]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.000]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.880]   Well, listeners, I'm super excited to talk to you today
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.240]   about something that, frankly,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.100]   I gave very little thought to as an early homeschooler.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.560]   And I have a friend to talk with today.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   You get to listen in on our conversation.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.760]   Kelly Wilt is joining me.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.080]   Kelly is also a member of the Classical Conversations
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.800]   Multimedia Curriculum Development team.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.900]   And we have lots of cool conversations.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.080]   And I thought it'd be fun for you guys to listen in
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.020]   on this conversation about family mission statements.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.720]   Kelly, how long have you been homeschooling?
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.120]   - Oh my goodness, Lisa.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.960]   - Like forever.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.580]   People ask me that and I think,
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.760]   well, longer than you have time to hear about.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.240]   - Yes, it's hard to believe.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   It seems like hardly any time at all
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.080]   and forever all at once, 15 years this year, Lisa.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.040]   - Oh my word.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.520]   - So God has been so faithful
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.360]   because at the beginning of this journey,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   if I had thought about the length of it,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.240]   I think I would have been intimidated,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.000]   but God has been so faithful to us.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.200]   - Yeah, I would have to say that too.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.300]   Now I look back and I think,
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.840]   oh, wow, when you said 15 and I said,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.000]   oh, wow, that's a long time.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.880]   And then I thought that my oldest daughter
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.840]   will be 30 in a few months.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.020]   So I must have been homeschooling for 25 years.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.000]   But I still love it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200]   I still do it.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.040]   I still have a passion for it.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.800]   God has placed homeschooling on my heart.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   And I think not just because I love my children
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.480]   and I love other people's children,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.400]   I've been blessed to tutor many other families' children.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.880]   It's not just that I love the children.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.500]   I really am so committed to homeschooling
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.280]   because I love parents and I love encouraging parents.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.040]   I love helping them to see that God has called them
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   to do an absolutely scary but wonderful thing
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.480]   and that they can do it.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.420]   And so that, y'all, is totally the reason
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.700]   I wanna talk about mission statements today
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.680]   because I was being completely honest.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.960]   Our family, when we jumped into homeschooling,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.460]   we jumped in with both feet and the full assurance
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.200]   that God was calling us to do it.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.520]   But we had no clue about a mission statement.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   And so we, Kelly and I, are gonna together
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.920]   kind of deconstruct that whole idea
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.520]   of having a family mission statement while you guys listen.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.180]   And hopefully, there'll be some takeaways for you.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.320]   And I suspect that you may come to believe
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.880]   that a mission statement might just be the thing
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.760]   that your homeschool is missing
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.160]   that will give it life and purpose, but we'll see.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.400]   Let me ask you, Kelly, does your family
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.480]   have a family mission statement?
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.960]   - Well, Lisa, let me say our family
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.640]   is very similar to yours in that,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.420]   when we first began homeschooling so many years ago,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.560]   mission statements were not in vogue.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.200]   That was not a term that we were familiar with.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   And so in my mind's eye, I think I had a very unfocused view
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.880]   of what homeschooling would be to our family.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.520]   And one of my sons is a photographer,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.000]   and so often, he will hand me his camera,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.640]   and I will look through the lens,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.380]   and everything will be blurry.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.920]   And he'll say, "Focus, Mom, focus!"
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.900]   And so I will turn that lens under his direction,
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.720]   and the picture will come into view.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.400]   And at the beginning of our homeschooling,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.860]   I think it was very similar in many ways to that process.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.860]   I thought in my mind, I knew where I wanted us to end up,
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.380]   but I'll be honest and say that I was not certain
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.180]   at moments how we would get there.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.000]   And so there was always this question in the back of my mind,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.880]   am I doing the right things?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.020]   Are we moving in the right direction?
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.800]   And classical conversations played a huge role
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.480]   in helping to establish that focus
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.260]   in our family for our journey.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.720]   So I would say at the very beginning, no.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   Now over time, as our vision as a family
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.200]   has sharpened for what homeschooling
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.140]   actually is for our family,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.820]   we have come across some phrases and some words
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.580]   and sentiments by studying God's Word,
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.240]   or even through our reading,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.220]   our common reading that we do together as a family
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.840]   that I think have given us more clarity as a family
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   to what homeschooling is and what it can be for our family,
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.740]   not only in the years past, but in the years to come.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.980]   - I really like that.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.780]   I like the analogy that you made
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.980]   to looking through the lens of a camera.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.380]   And yeah, you can see things,
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.780]   but it's not as sharply focused
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.820]   as you thought it was gonna be.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.500]   You know that when you look through that
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.140]   at something beautiful, this always happens to me.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.100]   We will drive up to the Blue Ridge Parkway in the fall
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.220]   to look at the leaves,
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.620]   and they are just so stunningly beautiful.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.860]   And I take a picture, but when I come home,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.860]   the picture is never, I never feel like exactly,
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.560]   that it's exactly what I was looking at.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.660]   And so somehow I'm not capturing
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.420]   the full beauty that is there.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.820]   And so I really appreciate what you said.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.580]   Sometimes looking, focusing, adjusting the focus
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.640]   a little bit can bring things into sharper relief.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.880]   Okay, so you said you didn't have one when you started,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.500]   but you eventually saw the light, so to speak,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.620]   and realized that a family mission statement
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.880]   might be a good thing.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.940]   And as you grew in your understanding
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.920]   alongside your family of what it could be,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.680]   that that seemed like a desirable thing.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.460]   What I was thinking when I realized
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.420]   that we really needed to address this,
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.980]   I started trying to think,
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.980]   why might a family want a family mission statement?
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.900]   And I want you to help me think through that.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.160]   I came up with a couple of things.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.900]   A family mission statement
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.700]   gives us as a family an identity.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.640]   It's something that stamps all of us
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.240]   as belonging together in purpose.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.340]   And that's the other thing that a family mission statement
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.540]   can give your family.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.540]   It can very clearly state what you all see
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.840]   as the purpose of your home, not just your homeschooling,
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.180]   but what is God's purpose for you as a family unit
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.380]   in the world?
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.420]   Why did God ordain from the foundation of the world
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.480]   that you be part of this family?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.840]   I think that having a family mission statement
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   acquaints every member of your family with the mission.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.220]   What is God calling you, not just to be,
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.060]   'cause that's your identity,
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.060]   but what is God calling your family to do together?
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.580]   What are you thinking?
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.580]   Why might a family want a family mission statement?
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.340]   - Well, I feel like a driver
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.940]   who is looking through the rear view mirror with a car
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.300]   in reverse just a little bit, hindsight is 20/20.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.100]   But I think now looking back to when we first began
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.900]   homeschooling, a mission statement would have been so helpful
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.340]   because I think you're right.
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.180]   I think that it gives a family a shared meaning.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.340]   It gives you a shared purpose,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.100]   but I think it also establishes a family culture.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.020]   We have some things that we say as a family and jokingly,
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.780]   when our boys were younger, now they're young men,
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.580]   but we, my husband and I determined
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.200]   we wanted them to be hardworking.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.820]   And so very flippantly, we would say,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.500]   wilts don't whine, we do things.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.700]   - Oh, I love it.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.700]   - It began as this refocusing tool that we would use
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.180]   where, oh, they would be in the middle of putting together
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.180]   an any chart for a book maybe they didn't enjoy as much,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.440]   or they would be working on an outline
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.120]   or working on a difficult assignment
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.860]   or committing something to memory.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.940]   Obviously something that would take time
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.900]   and energy and effort.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.540]   - Right, and determination, yeah.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.540]   - That's right, we would start to notice
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.500]   that the attitudes would take a turn south.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.260]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.720]   - So my husband would look at me and he would say,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.920]   wilts don't whine, and I would say, we do things.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.600]   And it was so funny over the years,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.160]   it has become a catchphrase in our family
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.500]   to the point that when we're in community,
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.840]   I've heard my child say, our youngest say to herself,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   wilts don't whine, they do things.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.960]   (laughing)
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.000]   - What a great mantra though.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And what an important way to teach little children
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.320]   a great spiritual and character truth
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.700]   in a fun way, but that makes you all part of the same team.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.920]   Because it wasn't that you were saying,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.400]   Jonathan, stop whining, or Libby, you know better than that.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.040]   It's, this identifies us all.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.980]   I'm part of this family that doesn't whine, it does things.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.960]   How lovely, I like that.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.840]   - Well, and you know, thinking about this,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.600]   I think way back at the beginning
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.660]   of our homeschool journey, having a mission statement
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.420]   would have also helped us to determine our why.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.700]   Why were we doing this?
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.060]   Because you know, I just was jokingly talking
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.960]   about my children doing difficult things.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.820]   Well, Lisa, you and I both know,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.820]   homeschooling itself on most days is a difficult thing.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.300]   And so having that statement would have helped me
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.900]   to focus my mind and my heart,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.820]   just like I tried to do with my children,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.800]   so that I could stay the course.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.380]   Because you know, looking back, one thing I know for certain
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.960]   is that God called us to this path.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.860]   And to stay committed to something that is difficult
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.820]   takes fortitude, it takes perseverance,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.560]   it takes determination on the most difficult of days
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.100]   to stay the course and to continue to move forward
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.320]   so that God can complete the work that He's called you to do.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.160]   And so having that focused statement,
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.940]   I think would have done for me and my homeschool momma heart
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.000]   the same thing that saying, "Wilts don't whine,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.040]   we do things for my children."
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.340]   - I love that, I love that.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:55.300]   Another thing that having a family mission statement can do
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.220]   is help us form goals, help us formulate goals
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.600]   for our family.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.200]   What kind of impact are we gonna have on the world?
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.100]   If a world impact is part of your mission statement,
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.620]   then what will you do?
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.440]   It actually helps to flesh out
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.400]   or to give you something to flesh out.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.800]   Not just the whys, but the whats,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   and then the hows of what your family is going to do.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.880]   As you move through.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.480]   So we've talked a lot about why a family might want
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.580]   a family mission statement, okay.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.920]   But really, I want us to get super practical
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   because I can remember Kelly as a new homeschooling mom
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:54.360]   and I had a five year old who was itching
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.920]   to learn everything and thought that she already knew
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.120]   most of it.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.400]   And then a two and a half year old that just wanted
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.880]   to be with us wherever we were and whatever we were doing.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.440]   And I remember thinking, "Oh glory, I've got to teach
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   "this little soul how to read and all about numbers
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.920]   "and I want her to be curious about the world.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.480]   "I want both of them to be healthy and happy
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.840]   "and I want them to know about God and I want them
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.120]   "to learn how to live in a family."
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.640]   Oh, I was so overwhelmed some days.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.440]   I mean, isn't coming up with a family mission statement
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.240]   just a bridge too far?
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.520]   Isn't that just too much for families starting out?
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.400]   - You know, I remember those days where my husband
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.600]   would come home from work and I would hand him a baby
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.360]   while I was stirring spaghetti sauce on the stove
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.080]   and I would say, "We made it, we're all still alive."
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.560]   And that was the goal of the day.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.120]   You know, I think that as I have learned more
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.600]   and as our family has grown, I've realized that
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.560]   as our family grows, so has our mission.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.880]   Our understanding of our mission has grown,
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.120]   our understanding of what it can and should be has grown
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.800]   just as my children have.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.680]   And so when my boys were super little, I would say,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   because I had two very distinct personalities.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.240]   I had a first born perfectionist who would build
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.120]   elaborate block towers and then I had my second born
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.040]   who delighted in knocking every single one of them over.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.080]   And so there was always just an underlying conflict
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.120]   going on between the two boys.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   And so I would say to them, love God, love each other,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.960]   daddy, mama, sister, brother.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.860]   And we would say that because at that point
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.880]   in our homeschool journey, those were the goals.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.680]   I wanted my boys, and this was before their sister
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.240]   even came along, so they were ready for her
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.280]   whenever she came.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.040]   But I wanted them, first of all, to love God.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.720]   I knew that was a goal from the beginning.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.280]   That was a distinctive that I wanted for our family.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.680]   And I wanted them to love each other well.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.400]   Now that looked very different when I had a six year old
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.920]   and a three year old, than it does now as I have young men
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.260]   who are approaching manhood to live independently
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.280]   of our family, which seems so bizarre to say
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.520]   because those block knocking over days
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.580]   just seemed like yesterday.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.160]   But now I see the relationship they have.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.600]   They do love the Lord.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.000]   They do love each other.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And when I walk past our son who is still at home's bedroom,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.760]   and I hear him in conversation with his brother,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.760]   I see that God used that little saying to cement a value
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.800]   in their hearts and minds to love God
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.480]   and to love each other well.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.520]   And so even though at that stage in the game
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.640]   when they were small, we did not have
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.100]   a formal mission statement.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.920]   The sentiment, the values definitely were there
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.220]   and took root and were ingrained
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.160]   even when they were little guys.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.340]   And now I get to enjoy the fruit of that
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.180]   as I see their near adult relationship with each other.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.940]   What a gift.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.360]   - Man, I love that.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.780]   I love that.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.780]   Love God, love each other.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.260]   I love that.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.540]   I love that because we had little sayings
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.460]   in our family too that we grew up in.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.880]   Some days it was just a one-off that you just said
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.660]   and it developed a life of its own.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.340]   Maybe it had a rhythm or a cadence
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.760]   or in a lighthearted way spoke a deep truth
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.200]   that you guys tended to live out.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.740]   And so those are so, so fun to hold on to.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.520]   And I bet your kids still remember those things.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.860]   This is what I want to say about families
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.180]   who might feel like, oh, now I have to come up
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.100]   with a mission statement and do all this stuff.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.620]   Here's what I want to tell you.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:28.860]   A mission statement, I believe,
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   is worth the quote-unquote trouble for three reasons.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:39.260]   Okay, I know I sound like a loss of tools of writing paper.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.100]   Okay, for three reasons, at least three reasons.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.180]   Here's one thing.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:49.180]   A family mission statement can help you get started right.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:55.000]   It can help you distill the things
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.480]   that are truly important to you,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.060]   that God has laid on your heart.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.100]   It will help you articulate, like Kelly said, your why.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.720]   Why has God called me to this?
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.900]   But it will help you get started right
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.540]   so that in the middle of a really bad day,
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.580]   you will be able to go back to your mission statement
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.580]   and say, but what our family is about is loving God
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:31.300]   and learning how to love others and filling in those blank.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   And that brings me to the second reason
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.620]   that a mission statement is a really good thing.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:41.340]   It will continually bring you back to home base.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.020]   Those of you listeners who've been homeschooling
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.640]   for a long time know that even though
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.000]   we're everyday educators and we are learning
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.920]   alongside our children, we are still sometimes
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.920]   led astray by the eye candy of what other families are doing
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.100]   or what seems like a really great gimmick.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.360]   It's flashy or colorful or fun.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.660]   And we get spread thin or pulled
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.860]   in too many different directions.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.300]   A family mission statement will always bring you back
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.040]   to home base, will always bring you back
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.460]   to the foundations of why am I doing this?
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.540]   What am I called to do in my home
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.600]   with my children and in the world?
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.820]   And here's another thing.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.120]   The third reason I think a family mission statement
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   is so wonderful is that it will calm you.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.380]   It will give calmness to your homeschooling
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.440]   and to your family life because your family mission
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   statement will actually help refine your choices.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.800]   There are some things, you cannot,
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.060]   have you ever been to a homeschool book fair?
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.060]   Oh my gosh, for people who love books,
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.900]   it is just like I sometimes go in
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.600]   and just sort of spin in a circle.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.340]   I'm just like, I don't know what's a good thing
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.180]   to look at first.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.120]   There's so many good things and there's so many choices
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   and there's so many good choices.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.020]   But too much of a good thing is not too good.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.340]   It is still just too much.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.300]   And so you gotta have something that will help you
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.540]   refine your choices and find the things,
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:33.140]   the activities, the emphasis, the books,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.340]   the avenues of study that really further
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.340]   your family's mission as God has led your family to see it.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:47.680]   And that's why I think a mission statement is so important.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:56.460]   I can't, I really do think it's awesome to have one.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.660]   Let's talk a little more practicality.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.460]   Who should write this?
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.520]   Kelly, when you guys started coming up
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.620]   with more of a statement, did you and Kim,
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.460]   your husband write it together?
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.100]   Did you write it and get him to pass off on it?
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.000]   Or did you involve the whole family?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Well, I involved our whole family and let me tell you why.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Because I wanted this to be a focus for all of us,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.860]   not just something that mom had imposed on our family.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.560]   I wanted them to feel that they were a part
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.020]   of our family culture because they are.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.540]   Each person in your family is unique
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.740]   and uniquely given to you to fulfill God's purpose
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.580]   for your family in this world.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.580]   And so involving each of them, to me,
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.900]   was the right path to take.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.080]   And I would encourage young families
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.060]   who are listening to this podcast,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.060]   you may be in the age right now where you have
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.140]   a mixture of ages, maybe even a three-year-old
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.380]   and our two-year-old who just likes to blurt out things
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.560]   like I love pizza, frogs are gross.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.780]   You just never know what things they're going to observe
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.180]   and want to make known.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.620]   I would encourage you to sit down
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.780]   even with those little list of babies
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.020]   and really listen to everyone's contributions
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.780]   for your family statement.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.900]   Because behind that I love pizza statement,
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.980]   there may be a little one who is actually saying,
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.940]   I love pizza because our family spends time together
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.500]   around the table.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.820]   I love pizza because it's something that we make together
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.900]   in the kitchen that's fun.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   There may be an underlying why or a how
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.980]   that's just under the surface.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   And so allowing each member of the family to contribute
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.220]   validates each member of your family as part of a whole.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.900]   And I think in that sense,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.740]   the process to get to a mission statement is as valuable
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.100]   if not more valuable than the product, the end result.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.060]   Because you were in conversation with those people
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.660]   who sit at the very center of your heart
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.340]   talking about what sets you apart in this world?
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.340]   What is your family's role in this world?
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.820]   And how do you want your family to grow
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.020]   in this world that God has made?
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.700]   And those are definitely valuable things
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.940]   that even the smallest members of your family
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.860]   should hear you speak aloud because it gives them weight
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.260]   and it gives them meaning and it helps them
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.620]   even from those youngest days to have understanding
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.540]   about what is valuable to your family
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.260]   and how God has uniquely created you to come together
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.300]   and to serve him in this world.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.180]   - That's cool.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.180]   And realizing that God has put you all together
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:13.580]   in a specific family for a specific purpose
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.420]   is kind of awe-inspiring.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.420]   And even for little children to think God chose us
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.900]   to be together on purpose so that we could learn
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.140]   to know him more and love him more and love one another.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.540]   But he may have given your family
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.180]   something unique to do in the world.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.980]   And so pulling your family together to sit down
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.220]   and have a conversation about, okay, guys,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.940]   what is ours to do?
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:56.780]   What is ours to do in our little community
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.860]   that maybe if we don't take up the task, nobody will do it?
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.060]   What is ours to, and it gives me chills
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.060]   to think about that because what a lovely thing
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.980]   for your children to realize from an early age
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.060]   is that God has intentionally planned good works
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.660]   for them to do.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.980]   And he planted them first in a family
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.980]   so that they could know and learn and grow to know him
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.900]   and love him and be prepared for the good works
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.060]   that he has for them to do.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:39.060]   So what if our listeners are thinking now,
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.540]   'cause I'm here to tell y'all,
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.380]   if you've been homeschooling five or six years and think,
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.900]   well, I just missed that boat.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.980]   I mean, I've just been messing around for five or six years.
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.180]   I don't know what I'm gonna do now.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.100]   It's never too late.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.060]   And you know what, guys, if you've been at this for a while,
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.460]   you might have a better idea than ever before
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.540]   what your family's mission statement could be
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.180]   and maybe should be given what you now know
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.740]   about your family.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.300]   But I suspect there's some people who are listening
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.860]   that think, well, I never thought about having
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.620]   a family mission statement.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.140]   Or if I thought about it at all,
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.300]   I thought that's not for me.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.900]   But now I think it might be for me.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.260]   It might be for us.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.900]   Where do we get ideas?
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.220]   Where do we get ideas for cultivating
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.940]   or writing a family mission statement?
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.640]   How do we know what ought to be included?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.940]   I have, I wanna share with you
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.940]   that writing a family mission statement
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.580]   is actually one of the things
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:55.380]   that our brand new piece of material,
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.340]   Scribblers at Home, Recipes from Lifelong Learners,
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.920]   writing a family mission statement
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.060]   is one of the very first activities
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.620]   that is advocated for families and scribblers.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.700]   And so some of you, if you have
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.380]   the Scribblers resource already,
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.020]   if you look on pages two and three,
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.060]   that's where we talk about a family mission statement.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.660]   There's some questions that we know
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.100]   that families might want to begin thinking.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.940]   And new families, I understand that you might be overwhelmed.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.600]   Your big question right now might be,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.340]   but what do I want my children to know?
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.460]   I'm not sure, what should I want my children to know?
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.700]   But there's some things, there's some other questions
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.180]   that I would advocate you asking first.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:53.020]   Questions that might lead you gently toward
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.720]   what you want to enjoy with your family.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:01.140]   And like I said, this is in Scribblers on page two,
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.500]   but I'm just gonna mention these questions really quickly.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.020]   They will give you something to think about
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.380]   if you are beginning to work on a family mission statement.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.500]   What is your family's purpose?
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.620]   Now maybe you've never thought about that before.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.900]   Spend some time seeking the Lord
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.860]   and talking with the people in your family
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.380]   and really try to figure out what is it?
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.540]   What is our purpose?
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.640]   Why are we together?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.440]   What are your family's priorities?
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.460]   What are your family's priorities?
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.660]   I suspect that most of us would say that knowing God
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.020]   and bringing our children into relationship
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.060]   with the Lord Jesus is one of our highest priorities.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.460]   But for some families,
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.200]   physical fitness is a very high priority.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.740]   For some families, spending time with extended family
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.160]   is a priority.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.580]   For some families, it's learning how to plant a garden
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.740]   or fix a leaking faucet
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.680]   or work with your hands.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.780]   What are your family's priorities?
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.780]   How does education fit into your purpose and priorities?
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.620]   That question will begin to help you
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.180]   make homeschooling decisions.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.680]   But homeschooling decisions on purpose,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.820]   not on accident or not on
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.740]   'cause that's what everybody else was doing
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.500]   or because that's what I thought I was supposed to do.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.140]   Number four, do you have a family mission statement
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.400]   which is a family purpose?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.360]   What you could consider, what makes your family unique?
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:50.340]   How would you, what are your identifying characteristics?
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.020]   How will you identify yourself?
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.300]   When our family, when our oldest daughter was born,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.080]   she wasn't, she was fairly precocious in speaking.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.620]   So she was not too very old before we realized
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.100]   that she was picking up on our love of sarcasm.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.220]   And so she, when her sister came along,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.620]   she was cut from a different piece of cloth
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.940]   and we realized that that sarcasm
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.400]   did not come naturally to her.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.120]   And if that was gonna stay a love language for our family,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.460]   we had to initiate her into it.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.520]   So what makes your family unique?
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.480]   But how, what's an identifying characteristic of your family?
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.520]   How will you love one another?
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.880]   Ooh, how will you each give and receive love?
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.240]   That's an important thing to know about your family.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.640]   What traditions do you have now
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.720]   and what traditions would you like to begin?
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.620]   These are just some beginning questions
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.620]   that might help you narrow down your family mission statement.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.060]   Kelly, I want some ideas from you too.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.300]   Where do we get ideas of how to craft our statement?
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.140]   What kind of stuff are we supposed to put in there?
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.740]   - Well, that is a great question.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.000]   And I think the questions that you've just listed
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.780]   are a great place to start because I think for me,
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.260]   at the beginning of this journey,
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   I definitely would have needed inspiration,
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.880]   even begin thinking about the scope
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.860]   of what homeschooling would mean for our family.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.080]   Like I said, those early days very much felt survival-based
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.940]   and really I wanted our family to thrive
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.560]   in their homeschooling journey.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.220]   I did not want our days to feel thin and drawn.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.980]   I wanted them to feel rich and full.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.960]   And so at the beginning, I had to look past
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.140]   what our current place was.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.760]   Almost like I was saying before,
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.500]   when I would look through my son's camera
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.880]   and look at a far off place and draw focus,
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.020]   I think in those beginning days,
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.620]   I had to really, in my mind's eye,
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.820]   pray for God to reveal a future to me
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.820]   that was rich in wisdom and goodness and truth
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.580]   through my little people who were just
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.780]   at the very beginning stage, who wanted to sit in my lap,
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.060]   who wanted to hear stories,
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.520]   who wanted to go and dig in the dirt in the backyard
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.820]   and find worms and all of those things
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.220]   that make childhood so wonderful
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.960]   because there's discovery through play.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.480]   As a mom, I had to think, be forward thinking
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.040]   about where that would lead them.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.480]   What kind of people did I want them to be
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.700]   in this world for the Lord?
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.020]   What was, like you said, what were the tasks
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.900]   that would be given to them to do
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.900]   on this side of eternity to glorify God?
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.400]   And so I love that list of questions that you just shared
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.660]   because there is so much wisdom to be found
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.660]   in thinking deeply before you get to a place of expectation,
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.380]   thinking deeply in preparation
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.640]   because I think so often we can be very tempted
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.500]   to shoot an arrow and then draw the target
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.420]   and declare ourselves successful.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.220]   And quite often, if we would just take time
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.940]   to prepare and to pray,
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.520]   actually I probably should reverse that,
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.060]   to pray and prepare to think how God
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.460]   will multiply our efforts because we've taken time
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.200]   to commit that process to Him.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.140]   So I love that list of questions.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.660]   And I love also in the Scribblers at Home book
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.140]   how there are also conversation starters
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.420]   on that very same page to think about
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.740]   not only what your family may need,
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.260]   but what do you want to do with your children?
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.900]   I knew when we began this journey
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.380]   that I wanted to escape the paradigm of education
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.780]   that I had been in my past.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.660]   I knew I might not have known what homeschooling could be,
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.980]   but I had a pretty good idea of what I didn't want it to be.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.120]   And so I had to pray and commit that to God and say,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.940]   okay, Lord, help me not only to run from something,
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.300]   help me to run toward you and use this as a tool
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.780]   in my children's lives so that they could know Him.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.060]   And as we say here in CC,
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.700]   to know Him and to make Him known in this world.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.660]   So those questions that are at the bottom of page two also
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.380]   are really helpful.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.580]   And particularly the final one at the bottom of that list,
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.220]   how can you cultivate teachable moments,
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.540]   was a turning point for me as a homeschool mom.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.540]   Because in my former life, before I was a homeschooler,
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.540]   I was a classroom teacher.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.780]   And so when we began our family,
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.780]   I was very wary of being my profession with my family.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.660]   And so I think at first I shied away
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.220]   from those teachable moments
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.460]   because I wanted my children to have some rest.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.860]   And the truth is what I needed to do was pray for God
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.440]   to reveal those moments to me
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.900]   so that I could show Him to them in those moments.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.860]   So I really, I love the fact that these questions
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.860]   are included so that we think what is unique to our family?
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.140]   But not only what is unique to us,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   but what do we want to achieve through this process?
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.580]   So good, so that we're not shooting an arrow
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.660]   and drawing a target.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:54.060]   We draw that target and then we're able to take aim
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.420]   because we know exactly where we're headed.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.860]   And that is so valuable.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.220]   - It really is.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.900]   I love what you were saying about including your children
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   and recognizing that your family mission statement
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.260]   is going to impact your children.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.240]   And I got to thinking,
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.880]   it's not just impacting your children while they're little
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.120]   as you begin to homeschool them.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   It is going to impact your children as they grow up
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.300]   and as they leave your home.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   What is it that your children, that you want them to become?
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.460]   Like you said, let's consider what do we want them
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.380]   to grow to be lovers of God?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.700]   But who are they and who has God made them to be?
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.420]   And I think that they can draw some identity
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.360]   from this family mission statement.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.100]   I think that they can draw some direction
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.100]   from the family mission statement.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.220]   I think that having a family mission statement
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   provides our children a grounding in who they are in Christ,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.460]   in who they are in the family
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.620]   and in who God is molding them to become.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:20.620]   And what a great gift to give our children as they grow up.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.160]   I love it.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.220]   It impacts our children even as they grow up and leave home.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.580]   - Kelly, you've been such, as always,
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.220]   such a good conversation partner
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.860]   as we've kind of wrestled through
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.100]   a family mission statement and how to repent
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.380]   from not having one and now maybe for the listeners,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.560]   how to do as we wish we had done.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.900]   Just talking about the value of it
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.740]   and how it can be a tool that the Lord uses
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.980]   to refine us in our homeschool as we really do follow
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.540]   His path has been really good.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.060]   I have one last question for you.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.200]   I'm gonna ask you the question and give you a minute
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.380]   to think as I tell our listeners about some other
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.900]   really good thing that I want them to know.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.620]   Here's my last question.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.620]   How are you, Kelly Wilt, an everyday educator
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.820]   and will you always be one?
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.100]   You think about that.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.140]   I'm gonna ask you.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.580]   Listeners, I wanna tell you about a little more maybe
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.940]   about something that you've heard rumors of,
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.660]   a brand new foundations through challenge
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.940]   for math curriculum called the Math Map.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.360]   Some of you may have heard that such a curriculum
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.620]   is being developed by Lee Bortons,
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.460]   the founder of Classical Conversations.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.460]   It is specifically designed to teach homeschool parents
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.660]   the language of math.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.600]   And once we learn the language of math,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.380]   we're going to be able to share that language
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.760]   with our children.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.500]   And now you might be saying, what does learning math
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.420]   have to do with learning a language?
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.780]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.780]   Like a foreign language, math has very specific vocabulary
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.100]   and concepts and notations that are just as unfamiliar
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.240]   to us at first as a foreign language might be.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   With the Math Map, you can discover and become more familiar
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.620]   with this language of math.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.460]   Right now, Classical Conversation members can access
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:43.460]   an exclusive sneak peek of the beta release
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.980]   of the Math Map, Naturals.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.440]   And you can find this on CC Connected.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.980]   As you walk through the lessons in Math Map, Naturals
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.460]   and become more familiar with the language of math,
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.220]   you're gonna be better equipped to teach your kids
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.400]   and have great conversations with your children about math.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   Now here's the deal, Math Map, Naturals will not stay
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.140]   on CC Connected forever.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.940]   So you be sure to get on there and work through it
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.180]   while it's still available.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.100]   To access Math Map, Naturals,
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.220]   log on to your CC Connected account,
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.220]   navigate to the Learning Center and search for the Math Map.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.740]   I think that you're gonna love it, I really do.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.900]   Now, Kelly, I'm back to you.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.740]   I wanna know the answer to the question,
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.840]   are you an everyday, how are you an everyday educator?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.700]   And will you always be one?
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.820]   - Oh, that's a really great question.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.720]   So I will start by telling you
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.260]   our family's mission statement,
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.060]   our working mission statement at this point in the game.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.780]   And I will say to people who are listening right now,
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:04.780]   at this point, we are 15 years into what will probably be
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.620]   almost a 20 year journey for our family.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.800]   So we have homeschooled for quite some time.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   And so it's taken me to this point to sharpen our focus
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.100]   to the place where I have these thoughts.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.420]   But this is our family's working mission statement.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.560]   The purpose of our family is to know God
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.620]   and to make Him known, sound familiar?
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:36.640]   By seeking truth, promoting goodness and celebrating beauty
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.800]   in and through the world He's created.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.460]   So I would answer your question, Lisa, with this.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.060]   I am an everyday educator,
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.720]   and this is how I will continue to seek to be one.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:56.820]   My prayer is that I will look for God in creation.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.420]   Everywhere that I look, I see Him.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.260]   And I will pray, like I mentioned before,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.220]   for those teachable moments.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.420]   Not only what I can teach my children,
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.660]   but what God can continue to teach me.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.580]   Because we are all on an education journey,
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.460]   not only as homeschool families,
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.860]   but as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.300]   And so as He continues to reveal Himself to us,
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.440]   we can know Him more deeply,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.140]   and then we can reflect Him in this world.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.380]   So yes, my goal is to be an everyday educator
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.260]   all the days that He gives me.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.960]   - That's awesome, and I suspect did nothing less.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.580]   Thank you for sharing today, Kelly.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.420]   Listeners, thank you for joining us.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.380]   I hope this has given you food for thought.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.100]   And I encourage you, as always,
