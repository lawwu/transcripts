[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.420]   that chapter which we read at the beginning in the book of Job, chapter 28.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.420]   And we are going to look in particular at the two questions asked and the answer given
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.200]   in verses 12, 20 and 28.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.620]   But where shall wisdom be found?
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.740]   And where is the place of understanding?
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.860]   Hence then cometh wisdom, and where is the place of understanding?
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.020]   And unto men he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.140]   evil is understanding.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.780]   Now it is probably true to say that this book of Job is one of the oldest books in the world.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.020]   Job was a man who lived at the very dawn of history, and the record which we have here
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.980]   therefore is one of the earliest records that is known to men.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.020]   And that is what makes this book such an interesting one and such a profound one.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.460]   It belongs to the so-called wisdom literature of the Bible.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.460]   Now the whole of the Bible is a book of wisdom.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.020]   The Bible is a book which is concerned about life.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.660]   It is a very practical book, that is why there is so much history in it.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.780]   It must never be regarded as something abstract, theoretical, academic.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.020]   The Bible is the manual of the soul, it is the handbook of life, and everywhere, always,
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.860]   it is to be found dealing with life.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.100]   Now here I say we come to look at one of the oldest of the books that is in this old book,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:14.900]   and we shall find that it is full of instruction and full of light for us.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:25.940]   It helps us, as I want to try to show you, that it is always contemporary, that though
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.980]   it is very old, it is always up to date.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.180]   Now this chapter that we are looking at is one of the crucial chapters, one of the most
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.300]   important chapters in the whole book.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.580]   The book has got a theme, as you know, it has got a thesis.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580]   It is the great problem of suffering.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.020]   Job, this man of God, could not understand why his circumstances had taken such a turn,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.540]   and why he found himself in this terrible condition.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.460]   His sons and daughters killed, much of his goods had been destroyed, and he himself suffering
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.980]   from the most agonizing, terrible condition of his skin.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180]   And his friends come along, you remember, to talk to him, to try to help him, but make
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.060]   things much worse, and they are all together trying to understand this thing which is happening
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.060]   to Job.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.020]   Well, now, in this chapter, this great theme is really dealt with in a very profound manner,
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.900]   and we are given the answer not only to Job's particular problem, but to a much larger and
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.060]   to a much bigger problem.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180]   Very well, let's look at it together.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.340]   Now as we read the chapter, you all must have been struck by two things that are in it.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.940]   There are many other things, but there are two that stand out on the very surface.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.260]   The first is the remarkable knowledge that people possessed in those days.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260]   Surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they find it.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.620]   Iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stone.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.900]   Now, this was written many, many, many centuries ago, but they seemed to know quite a good
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.380]   deal then, didn't they?
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.580]   I am only referring to this as we pass along, because I suppose the chiefest characteristic
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.220]   of the modern man is his pride in his knowledge, and not merely his pride in his knowledge,
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.940]   but the patronizing way in which he tends to look back upon everybody who has ever lived
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.980]   in this world before this century.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.580]   Ignoramus is, knew nothing.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.140]   Now this is one of the modern man's troubles.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.100]   It's why his world is as it is.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.900]   He's so proud of his knowledge and so confident in it, and tends to think, as I say, that
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.300]   nobody as it were had ever really lived until this present century.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.940]   Of course, we've got vast knowledge.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.300]   I am in agreement.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.540]   We all know that.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.940]   But let's not be foolish.
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.940]   Let's not imagine that there was no knowledge until we came on the scene.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.020]   You know, men and women knew a great deal many, many long centuries ago.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.580]   They knew a good deal about iron and brass and gold and rubies and diamonds.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.460]   There's a sort of contemporary ring about this chapter, isn't there?
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.420]   Well, that's not my theme tonight, but it's something worth noting in passing.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.900]   It doesn't do us much harm to be humbled now and again, does it?
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.780]   We are not quite as wonderful as we sometimes tend to think.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.420]   Let's not lose our heads, my friends, because we've sent a man up into outer space.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.060]   People have known a great deal in past ages.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.740]   But the second thing is the thing to which I want to call your attention tonight, and
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.380]   that is that the real problem confronting mankind is always the same.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.140]   Oh, I know the world has changed a great deal since the time of Job.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.540]   We needn't waste our time in talking about that, need we?
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.860]   Job had never heard of Major Gagarin, never heard of him.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:17.620]   But you know, the problem in the day of Job was the greatest problem of today, the same
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.620]   problem.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.700]   Now, this is something which is, of course, quite basic and fundamental.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.100]   We will persist in thinking that we are different and that our problems are so different.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.620]   Haven't you noticed the terminology?
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.020]   How we give ourselves away in our phrases and in our clichÃ©s?
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.700]   The problem of the twentieth century, the problem of the post-war world, the problem
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.980]   of this scientific age.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.540]   Isn't that it?
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.540]   That's what we like to talk about, our problems.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.260]   And the impression which we are giving, of course, the whole time, and we do so because
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:00.060]   we believe it, is that our problem is of a type and of a kind that the human race has
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.480]   never known before.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.420]   And because our problem we think is new, well, we must have a new solution, we must
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.420]   have a new answer.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.100]   That's why people are no longer interested in Christianity.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.020]   That's why they wouldn't dream of coming like this tonight, doing what you are doing
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   and reading this book.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.020]   Impossible, this, how can that conceivably help us?
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.820]   It's out of date, it isn't contemporary, it doesn't know the modern problem.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.860]   Well, you see, I'm taking you back to this oldest book and to this particular chapter
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:36.220]   because its central message is this, that the problem of the time of Job is our major
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.020]   problem today.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.980]   There's no change whatsoever.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.260]   The problem of man is identical with what it has always been.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:54.420]   Now then, let me put this in its truly modern setting and context.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.300]   Why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.520]   Why is there tension?
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.700]   Why is there strain?
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.220]   Why is there unhappiness?
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.900]   Why are things as they are between the nations?
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.460]   Why this division and why this preparation for war and the piling up and the messing
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.580]   of these horrible instruments of torture?
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.300]   What's the matter?
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.820]   Why are our papers, even in this country, so full of these problems?
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.380]   You can't pick up a paper without reading about a murder or a theft or a robbery or
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:33.820]   a divorce or a separation or some little children being neglected by selfish parents and the
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.940]   children themselves, lawless, disobedient, juvenile delinquents, impossible to maintain
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.020]   any kind of discipline in the schools and so on.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.380]   What's the matter?
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.980]   Restless young people.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.020]   What's the matter with the world?
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.380]   Why are things like this?
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.700]   Now that's the question, isn't it?
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.180]   Now, it's because we've got the answer to that question here in this 28th chapter of
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.940]   the book of Job that I'm calling your attention to it.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.380]   You know the complete answer is given here.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.020]   Now there's nothing new about this problem.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.380]   Man has always been like that, always.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.260]   It has its little variations.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.020]   Sometimes this problem is bigger than it was a century ago, but then there's something
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.980]   which reverses that, basically, fundamentally, the world has always been a difficult place.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.260]   Life has always been difficult.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.060]   There has been no change at all.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:34.820]   And the problem of problems is the problem that is posed, considered, and answered in
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.820]   this chapter.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.500]   Now then, let's analyze it together.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.740]   Why are things, I say, as they are?
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.460]   Why is life as it is this evening?
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.220]   Well, here's the first answer.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.780]   That man doesn't recognize the difference between wisdom and knowledge.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:01.660]   That man, if you like, is not aware of the difference between understanding and the possession
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.220]   of information.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.780]   Now, that is really the whole thing.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.140]   There is your problem in a nutshell.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:20.580]   The difference between learning and wisdom, knowledge and understanding.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.860]   Now that's the theme, as you've noticed, in this great chapter.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:30.260]   Now let's have a look at this, because this, I say, in the last analysis, really does give
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.860]   us the full explanation of the state of our world tonight.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.860]   That's the whole thing.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.980]   That's the whole trouble.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.260]   Now then, let's look at it like this.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.180]   Look at these two things.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.820]   On the one hand, learning, knowledge, information.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.820]   Now what is this?
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.340]   Well, we all ought to know about this.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.620]   This has been the thing that has charmed and fascinated men, especially during the last
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.820]   hundred years.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:04.140]   It is our proud boast, as I say, that the advances we've made in knowledge, in almost
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.220]   every realm and department, have been phenomenal.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.860]   And of course they have.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.140]   I'm not here to dispute facts.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.740]   It's no part of the preaching of the gospel to dispute or to deny facts.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.340]   And it is a sheer fact that the advance and increase in knowledge in the last hundred
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.980]   years has been quite unmatched and unparalleled.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.580]   And the modern man is particularly proud of that, as I say.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.900]   Now, it's interesting just to look for a moment into the history of all this.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:37.780]   It really began, you know, at what's called the Renaissance, towards the end of the 15th
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.540]   century and thereabouts, proceeding to the 16th century.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.860]   The Renaissance, the revival of learning.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.460]   There had been a dark era in the history of the world, the Middle Ages, with much darkness.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.260]   And life, you know, had been more or less stagnant for many, many centuries.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.380]   But now, things began to move.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.060]   Man began questing.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.820]   Columbus discovered America.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.460]   Now that was a shattering thing to do.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.940]   It was a revolutionary thing.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:13.580]   It opened up new horizons, discovered a new world, discovered that the world was round
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.580]   after all.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.380]   Now, here, you see, man began, as he thought, to shake off the shackles of the past.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:27.340]   He lost his blinkers and he began to go out and to search after knowledge.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.100]   Now this is the great quest then for learning and for knowledge.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.940]   And you're familiar with the story.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.460]   It happened in many, many realms.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:40.460]   They rediscovered again the great wisdom and philosophy of Greece and the great literature,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.460]   the great drama.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.460]   This was wonderful.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.020]   They were rediscovering knowledge.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.460]   But then they began to search and to examine.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.500]   Anatomy began to develop, the knowledge even of the human frame.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.820]   How little men knew about their own bodies before this time.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.780]   Physiology began soon afterwards.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.580]   A study of the human frame, getting to know something about the heart and the lungs and
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580]   all these things.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.180]   People used to believe in odd spirits before.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:11.420]   But now they really began to understand the working of men's own constitution, muscles,
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.420]   nerves, heart, and all the various functioning.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.700]   Wonderful.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.340]   But it went on all along the line.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.860]   The discoveries in so-called pure science were quite remarkable and astonishing.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.860]   Telescopes discovered.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.180]   Therefore, they were able to understand and find out things about the planets and all
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:35.180]   these things, and the moon and its function, and the sun, and how it was that the earth
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.020]   went round the sun and not vice versa, and so on.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:45.300]   Now all this, you see, is a part of this great story with which we are all so familiar.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:52.780]   And then the phenomenal inventions that have resulted from all this.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.980]   The discovery of how to harness the power of steam, steam engine.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.780]   Landing and locomotion revolutionized.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.580]   Then of course the internal combustion engine, still more marvelous.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.780]   Now rockets, sending a man up out of the reach of gravity and all the rest of it.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.420]   Well, of course, this is all simply tremendous.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.420]   This is knowledge.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.460]   We've acquired information.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:22.780]   And then of course the quite remarkable discoveries in the realm of the prevention of diseases,
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:30.780]   inoculation, the treatment of diseases, these so-called miracle marvel drugs of this century
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.780]   and so on.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.220]   Well, here it is, you see.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:38.380]   And the modern man looks at all this and he says, "Isn't it wonderful how ignorant our
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:44.100]   forefathers were, or how small their world was, how confined it was."
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.780]   You see, they didn't know these things.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.980]   They were ignorant of it all.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.460]   And here he is, the modern man.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:58.580]   He looks at all he knows and all he has discovered and this vast knowledge and information that
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.780]   he possesses.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:08.340]   And he tends to think this is the point, that this is everything, that this is the answer,
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.700]   this is the thing that is desired, this is the thing that is rarely required.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.140]   And as I say, he feels that it is, and that he has therefore arrived, he's superior to
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.660]   all that have gone before him.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.900]   And that therefore with all this, he's got possibilities that they didn't have, he's
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.500]   capable of doing things they couldn't do, and he cannot but feel, he's trying to persuade
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:36.420]   himself that with all this he's on now to solve the remaining problems and all is soon
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.420]   going to be well.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.260]   Now then, it's just here, you see, we need to ask our questions.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.340]   What is it that modern man has really got?
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.940]   The answer is he's got knowledge.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.940]   He's got information.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.860]   He's got encyclopedias.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.060]   He's got dossiers.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.660]   He's got books of facts, such as men never knew.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.660]   It's happening, it's developing and advancing every year.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.580]   A man who was studying for a degree in any department 40 years ago, he looks at a modern
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.720]   textbook and he feels very glad that he got qualified then and he didn't have to try the
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   examinations.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.300]   Now, this is happening, as you know, all along the line.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.060]   The knowledge, the information, your libraries are having to be expanded, you've got to have
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.060]   microfilms now.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.860]   There are so many books that you can't contain them all.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.100]   And man says, "Isn't it wonderful?
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.860]   Isn't it marvelous?"
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.540]   But is it?
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.540]   Is it?
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.620]   What's it led to?
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.140]   What's it really done to man himself?
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.980]   What has it done to the world?
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.820]   Now, isn't this the question we ought to be asking?
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.940]   And thank God some people are beginning to ask it.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.100]   Where's all this leading us?
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.020]   What's all this really giving us?
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.980]   Are we superior as men to our forefathers?
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.020]   In other words, we are beginning to realize that there is a difference between knowledge
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:03.560]   and wisdom, information, understanding.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.220]   You see, all this knowledge that we've gathered and garnered, what's it producing?
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.780]   Well, it's producing a world of terrible tension.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.340]   It's making people ask, some of the scientists are asking, "How much longer are we going
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.340]   to live?
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.860]   Have we got another 10 years?
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.300]   Is some fool going to press a button, let off a bomb or something?
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   Is it going to be the end?"
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.380]   Now, that's not a very wonderful world to live in, is it?
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.580]   Now, you see, in the light of all this knowledge and information, we've got now to face the
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.220]   facts and say, "What's it done?
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.220]   What's it led to?
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.260]   What does it achieve?"
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.500]   And you look out upon the present scene and you discover it to be what I described at
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.620]   the beginning.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.980]   Very well then, what is the trouble?
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.460]   Oh, the trouble is, you see, that while man has all this knowledge and information, what
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.940]   he lacks is wisdom, understanding.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.260]   He's done this, that, and the other, but where shall wisdom be found?
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.380]   Where is the place of understanding?
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.980]   Whence then cometh wisdom?
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.260]   Where is the place of understanding?
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.260]   That's the question.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.760]   Well, says somebody, what is the difference between the two?
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:15.200]   What is the difference between knowledge and wisdom, information, awareness of facts, and
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.360]   understanding?
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.000]   And the answer is surely something like this, isn't it?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.360]   This is what wisdom means.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.400]   Wisdom is the ability to use and to harness the knowledge of facts which you've arrived
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:39.040]   at in such a way and in such a manner as to promote man's best and highest interests.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.080]   That's wisdom.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.880]   Wisdom is the capacity and the power to know what to do with your facts and with your knowledge
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:52.360]   and information, to use them and not abuse them, to master them instead of being mastered
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.880]   by them.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.960]   That's wisdom.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.600]   It's very difficult to define wisdom.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.480]   There's all the difference in the world between a very knowledgeable man and a wise man.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.320]   I believe it's true to say, the members of the legal profession at present will forgive
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.920]   me if I'm wrong, but I'm prepared to debate it with them, there's been many a great advocate
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.280]   who's been utterly hopeless as a judge.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   That's a part of the difference.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.200]   A man may have great knowledge of the law, but he may be very bad at applying it and
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.480]   using it.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.840]   That's the kind of distinction.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:34.440]   A man who has vast information is not always the best man from whom to seek advice.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.240]   The two things are very different.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.960]   But what does it mean in this more particular sense?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.200]   Well, it means something like this.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.040]   Wisdom and understanding mean, and you see there it is, the word understanding really
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:20:00.360]   is the key, it is the difference between knowing about facts and knowing their significance,
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.360]   really understanding.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:07.920]   Now the tragedy of the modern man is he knows many things about himself and about life and
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.120]   living, but he doesn't understand.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   What doesn't he understand?
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.840]   Well, he doesn't understand himself.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.320]   He's almost turning himself into a machine.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.120]   All his thinking is in terms of this knowledge and information and all the gadgets and all
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.280]   the things that make life easy and pleasant and so on, but he doesn't realize the truth
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.400]   about himself.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.600]   Man in a way has never had a lower view of himself as judged by biblical standards than
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   he has today.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:47.520]   You know, a man is not just an animal who's in this world to eat or to drink or to indulge
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.520]   in sex.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.240]   That's not man.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.720]   But the modern man tends to think of himself like that.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.920]   What's the value of all this marvelous knowledge we've acquired and these brilliant inventions?
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.480]   Well, you can now get from London to New York in five hours or something.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.000]   That's what it gives me.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.600]   Well, that's marvelous.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.880]   I can get now from London to New York in five hours.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.400]   It used to take three months and more, even a couple of hundred years ago.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.480]   I can get from London to Glasgow in an hour and a half, and by train it takes seven, eight
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.480]   hours and so on.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.880]   Well, this is marvelous, says the modern man.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.040]   But is that really man?
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.720]   Is man just a creature who flits from here to there?
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.960]   Does life really just consist in getting from one place to another in a record time and
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.920]   doing it in much less time than somebody else?
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.120]   Is that life?
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   Is that man?
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.640]   But isn't that how we are tending to think?
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.040]   Wonderful food we've got.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.520]   Wonderful entertainments we have.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   Marvelous gadgets.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   Press buttons.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.200]   People used to have to sweat before.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.000]   You press a button and it's done.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.960]   You sit down and you watch it all.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:05.280]   And man seems to think that the ultimate for man, utopia, is the condition in which a man
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.940]   does nothing and everything's done for him.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.640]   And he just sits back and he enjoys himself.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.880]   But my dear friends, is that man?
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.280]   You see, if you're content with knowledge and information, that'll be the end of your
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   argument.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   But that isn't wisdom.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.080]   Wisdom says, "What is man?"
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.360]   What is he?
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   What is man as a being?
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.200]   What's he doing in this world?
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   What is life?
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.240]   Now, these are the questions that wisdom puts.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   Wisdom says, "Well, I don't care how long it takes me to get from London to New York.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   What is of concern to me is this.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.400]   How do I live when I'm in London or New York?
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.920]   What sort of a man am I?
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.640]   Not how quickly can I be carried in some sort of vehicle.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.920]   Why should I be carried at all?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.840]   What do I do when I get anywhere?
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   What's life about?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   What am I here for?
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.480]   What's it all mean?
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   What's it all leading to?
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.880]   And how can I live in a manner that I can look at myself in the mirror at night without
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.360]   feeling I'm a fool and a cad?
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.000]   How can I put my head down on the pillow and rest in peace, not be afraid that I'm going
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.720]   to die suddenly?
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.760]   How can I look into the face of death and not have a fear?
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.880]   How can I look into an unknown eternity and not be filled with terror and alarm?"
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.640]   These are the questions.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.880]   These are the questions that wisdom puts.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.600]   You can have a great information, but you can be very unhappy.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.560]   Wisdom looks for peace, peace of mind, peace of heart, the quiet mind.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:40.360]   Oh, the poor modern man, the slave of his own discoveries and inventions, how restless
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:47.160]   he is, poor fellow, to spend a night at home alone and to think he'd regard as the height
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.960]   of boredom, always must be going out somewhere, rushing after this or that, turning this on,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.200]   looking at that.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.680]   He doesn't know what it is to be at peace with himself.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.120]   He doesn't know what it is to have a quiet mind, a contented heart.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:09.000]   Contentment, joy, satisfaction, these are the things that matter in life, says wisdom.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.480]   But not only that.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.840]   Wisdom is that which enables you to understand something of what is happening in this world,
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.600]   and all its contingencies and eventualities.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.080]   When they meet the wise men, they don't take him by surprise.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.320]   You see, if you haven't got wisdom, if you've just got knowledge and information, and something
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.880]   happens, you don't know where you are, you don't know what to do.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.280]   But the wise men, he's pondered it all.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.960]   He's been thinking.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.720]   And he's got a view of life.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.240]   He's got an understanding.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.280]   So that when untoward events take place, he's not completely knocked off his balance.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   No, no.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.920]   He says, "We're living in a world like that.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.720]   It's always been like that.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.520]   It always will be like that."
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.840]   He's a man who's read, he's thought, he's meditated, and he's pondered.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.400]   So he's not upset.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.000]   He's got a balance, because he's got a balanced view of life.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.560]   And thus he's enjoying his peace of conscience, and thus he's ready for death and everything
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.480]   that lies beyond it.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.520]   Well now then, here is the point that is made, you see.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.640]   There is an eternity of difference between knowledge and wisdom, between mere information,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.480]   knowledge of facts, and true understanding.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.080]   And the tragedy of the world tonight is that men don't know this difference.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.640]   They're mad on knowledge.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.920]   They have no wisdom.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.360]   This book of Job has already put this point, puts this point rather later on in chapter
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.120]   33, when the man Elihu begins to speak.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.480]   He makes a very profound remark.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.340]   He says, "Great men are not always wise.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.840]   You can be a great man in this world, but not wise.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.400]   You can be a man of great information, a man of great gifts.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.100]   You can have wonderful faculties.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.200]   You may be a great speaker.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.400]   You may be a great artist, a great scientist.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:00.040]   But great men are not always wise, neither do the aged understand judgment.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.600]   It's an extraordinary thing, says this man, but that's what I've discovered, and it is
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.320]   equally true tonight."
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.240]   Very well then, knowledge is something that may very well enable a man to govern everybody
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.520]   and everything, but himself.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:22.400]   There are men of vast information who are tragic failures in their own personal lives.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.160]   There are men who have great knowledge of the law and can give wonderful judgments,
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.400]   but there have been many such who couldn't control their own thirst and their own lusts
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.240]   and passions.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.400]   There are men of great information in the realm of medicine.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:43.800]   They can advise people almost on anything, but there have been some of them in my own
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.520]   personal knowledge who have been tragedies in their own personal relationships and in
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.800]   their own married lives.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.280]   Great men are not always wise.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.840]   To have vast knowledge and information does not of necessity lead to wisdom.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.560]   So my friend, the question for you to face is this.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.460]   Not how much knowledge do you possess, how much wisdom have you got?
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.800]   Not so much what can you do with these things outside yourself.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.200]   How do you manage yourself?
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.480]   You know, there's a profound word about this in the book of Proverbs.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:24.840]   It says, "He that controleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city."
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.500]   In other words, it's a picture, you see, of a great general.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.080]   He can take a city.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.520]   He's a wonderful man at strategy and tactics, and he knows how to conquer great generals
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   on the other side.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   He can take a city.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.800]   Yes, says the book of Proverbs, but you know, if that man can't control himself and his
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:46.040]   own temper, he is finally a failure and may well end in disaster.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   Alexander the Great died at a very early age, and according to the books, he died of a mixture
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:00.760]   of drinking too much and venereal disease.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.640]   He that controleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:12.920]   Alexander the Great, the world conqueror, didn't have much wisdom, and he ended in
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   defeat.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.720]   Well, there is the first thing.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.360]   The modern man doesn't know the difference between knowledge and wisdom, but let me hurry
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   on.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.240]   He doesn't realize the priceless value of wisdom either.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.720]   This follows, of course, from the first.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.360]   Here it's put in a very graphic form.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.760]   Here is man searching for gold, searching for iron.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.240]   He'll search for diamonds, rubies, precious metals.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.680]   He's very interested in these things, and you notice the way, in this wonderful way
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.960]   in which we are told about his great skill and his ingenuity as he does so.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:54.160]   Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   It's man doing this.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.840]   And then he goes on describing the wonderful achievements of man and his amazing ingenuity
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.000]   and his wonderful industry.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.120]   He setteth an end to darkness.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   He goes into caverns.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.320]   You see, you've got to sink a shaft to get at these things.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.920]   He's discovered that it's there in the bowels of the earth.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.520]   Now that everything's dark, well, he sinks down a shaft and he takes light.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.240]   He setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection, the stones of darkness
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.000]   and the shadow of death.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.240]   But he doesn't stop at that.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.240]   The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant, even the waters forgotten of the foot.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   They are dried up.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   They are gone away from men.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.320]   As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, and under it is turned up as if it were fire.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.680]   The stones are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   Then listen.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.720]   This is, he says, what man has done.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.960]   There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.800]   The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.720]   But man gets there.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.320]   The wild beasts and the very sure-footed, they can get to most places.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.880]   They've never been there.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.480]   But man putteth forth his hand upon the rock.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.400]   Haven't you seen him doing it?
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.040]   Now, this is not bulldozers.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.760]   They hadn't got them then, but they've got their way of doing it.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.520]   You see, in the same way as they've got the power to build the pyramids in Egypt and the
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.480]   sphinx and so on, these men, they've got it.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.280]   They could turn a mountain upside down.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.560]   He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.960]   You know, these people really did know a thing or two, didn't they?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.600]   I hope I'm reducing your pride in the twentieth-century men a little bit if I'm doing nothing else
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.600]   tonight.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.520]   These men could turn mountains upside down.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.240]   He cutteth out the rivers among the rocks.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.000]   Aqueducts, they called them.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.120]   And they could do it.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   And his eye seeth every precious thing.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   Listen to this.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.520]   Look at the risks he takes.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.720]   You see, he says, gold, oh, gold, it's so precious.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   I must get it.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.160]   Pearls, we must get them.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.480]   So he bindeth the floods from overflowing.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.000]   You see, as you delve into the bowels of the earth, water keeps pouring down.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.720]   And you'll very soon be drowned if you don't do something about it.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.520]   So now he sets up a sort of barricade.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.400]   He sets up a kind of obstacle to the overspreading of the waters.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.920]   Then he gets a drainage system.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.120]   He bindeth the floods from overflowing.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.480]   And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth the light.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.760]   Now that's a very graphic and wonderfully poetic description, isn't it, of engineering
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.680]   and of mining.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.160]   But man does all this.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.440]   He risks his life.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.720]   He risks being drowned.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.320]   He risks the fall of rocks upon him and being crushed as he's down in the mines.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.000]   But he says it's worth it.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.440]   There's gold down there.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.520]   And even the gold dust is valuable.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   And there are rubies there.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   There are diamonds.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.800]   Why, he says, I'll risk anything for that.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.080]   Man believes in that kind of riches.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.680]   And so he goes down.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.160]   He displays this extraordinary ingenuity, this cleverness, this brilliance.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.320]   He can harness everything, hold back everything that's against him.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.600]   And he gets at his treasure.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:03.120]   And so he tells us of the value and the significance that he attaches to these precious metals
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.840]   that are in the bowels of the earth.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.700]   But here's the question, isn't it?
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.960]   Does he do the same with respect to wisdom?
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.720]   Does he do the same with respect to understanding?
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.200]   Oh, yes, he's marvelous.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   He'll build his rockets.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.000]   A man will risk his life and go up in it.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.880]   Major Gagarin, Lieutenant Shepard, marvelous, risking their lives.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   Yes, as these men risk their lives with the floods down in the depths of the shaft.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.520]   They'll risk their lives.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   Why?
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.360]   Well, we'll get to know something about Venus and about the moon and about Mars.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.600]   And we'll be able to travel still more quickly.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.320]   And then we'll be able to get our television much more perfectly because then it'll be
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.060]   hit up there and hit back again.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.200]   It's going to be marvelous.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   It's worth doing.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.200]   We'll risk his life.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.400]   And up he goes in his capsule, wonderful, and the whole world holds up its hands in
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:59.080]   astonishment and in amazement.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.320]   But do you see the same interest in wisdom?
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.420]   Do you see the same concern about understanding?
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:14.040]   Do you see the same readiness to give mind and heart and money and toil and sweat and
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:23.760]   research to living a clean and decent life, to being a good husband or a good wife, to
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.240]   giving your little children a chance in life instead of breaking their little hearts because
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:36.280]   of your selfish lusts, and living with one another as we ought to live in peace and enmity
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   and concord?
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   Oh, no, no.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.020]   You see, the world hasn't changed.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.560]   Men then would give everything for these riches, the knowledge that they want, which will give
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.980]   them the things they're interested in.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.280]   Why don't they do the same with regard to wisdom?
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.200]   Why don't they do the same with regard to understanding?
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.640]   They'll delve into the bowels of the earth to get gold.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:08.320]   They'll go up in rockets into the outer space in order just to discover some further facts.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.060]   Why won't they read this book which tells them all about wisdom?
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.120]   Why won't they study this Word of God that tells a man how to live and how to die and
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.560]   how to enjoy eternity?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   Why not?
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.760]   There you see the trouble.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.020]   Man displays that he doesn't realize the value of this.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.700]   But the value of this, my dear friend, as this man puts it, is this.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.100]   The price of this is above rubies.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.660]   Talk to me about gold and about brass and about iron and about your diamonds and your
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.660]   rubies.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.100]   I agree, they're wonderful, they're very precious, but you know it's a very artificial
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.100]   value.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.740]   They're precious because there are not many of them.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.260]   That's about all it comes to.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.500]   It's just a sort of carbon in the end, you know, but there isn't much of it, and therefore
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.340]   we say, "Oh, how precious, how valuable.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.460]   I've got it and somebody else hasn't got it."
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.900]   And we rave on it and we'll risk everything.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.100]   But the price of this is above rubies.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.100]   Why?
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.220]   Well, this enables you to do something that rubies can't make you do.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.780]   To be wealthy doesn't mean that you're wise.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.820]   To be wealthy doesn't mean even that you're happy.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.940]   Did you read of that poor millionaire this last week?
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.940]   I think it was.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.660]   He's the richest man in the world, I read.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:25.660]   But I read that he'd confessed in an interview that he was really very disturbed about the
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:31.740]   fact that he'd made a failure of his five marriages.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.260]   That man's beginning to think all honor to him.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.260]   He's quite right.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:41.860]   He said he'd trade all his wealth if he could only succeed in having a happy marriage.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.060]   That man's beginning to get wisdom.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:51.980]   What's the value of all his wealth to him if he doesn't know the simple, clean, glorious
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:58.380]   joy of a happy married life and bringing up children?
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.380]   Poor rich men.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:07.180]   The little man living in his cottage with his wife and his little children knows something
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.140]   that he doesn't know.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.340]   He's got something that is beyond the price of rubies.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.140]   All the gold of the world isn't equal to this.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.060]   No, no, my dear friend, but not only that.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.780]   This what else does it give you?
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:30.420]   Well, it not only gives you real life in this world, but it prepares you for the next.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.940]   What's the matter with men?
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:38.700]   Doesn't he see that that next world is getting very near to him at the present time?
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.180]   Your information and your knowledge is more than likely to blow up your world.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.660]   Well then you ought to be considering, "Where am I going?
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.740]   What about the next world?"
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.380]   Diamonds don't answer the question.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.340]   Gold doesn't answer the question.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.740]   Rubies don't answer the question.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.580]   Mars doesn't answer the question.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.940]   This and this alone answers the question.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.140]   That's why this is above the price of rubies in value.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.620]   You know, to possess the rubies of all the world won't help you on your deathbed.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.780]   It won't help you at all to die, but wisdom, it will.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.180]   It will give you the answer.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.460]   You'll go through the river of death triumphant and glorious.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.180]   You'll know where you're going.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.460]   Of course, he's right.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.340]   For the price of wisdom is above rubies.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.220]   The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.220]   Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:35.500]   Oh, the world is as it is tonight because the modern man doesn't know the value of
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   wisdom.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:43.900]   He's raving about things that are finally useless, and he is rejecting with scorn and
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.860]   with sarcasm the wisdom that is above rubies in value.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.940]   But come, I've got a third charge to bring against him.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:58.780]   The world is as it is because the modern man doesn't realize, even when he's made to
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:06.540]   think about this wisdom, that he can never attain it in and of himself.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.620]   You see, sometimes he's forced to think about it, like the men I've just been quoting.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.780]   And sometimes when a war comes, everybody's made to think of it.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.780]   Wisdom.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.780]   Or a death.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   Or an illness.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   Or a disease.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.620]   I've known many a man who started thinking truly about wisdom for the first time in his
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.180]   life when he gets his first attack of coronary thrombosis.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.620]   I've known many a man who really had never thought about life and about true living until
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.700]   that first attack.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.300]   And there on his back in bed, he began to say, "What's it all about?
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.300]   What am I doing here?
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.300]   How am I spending my time?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.100]   What's it all leading to?"
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.900]   He began to consider wisdom.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.180]   Yes, but you see, the question now is, how do you approach it?
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.980]   How do you think about it?
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.060]   And here man goes wrong again.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.300]   Because according to this teaching in this chapter, he first of all tries to understand
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.420]   things that he's not meant to understand, and that he can never understand.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.660]   Here it is, you see.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.660]   God has spoken.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.660]   God has made his decrees.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.780]   Then did he see it and declare it.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.740]   He prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.340]   Unto men, he said.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.600]   Now there's the division.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.260]   The moment man does begin to think, he goes wrong immediately by trying to think, I say,
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.300]   about things that he'll never understand.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.580]   He now tries to understand God.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.340]   That's what Job and his friends were doing.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   That's the theme of the book.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.740]   They were saying, "Well now, why does God behave like this to us?
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.140]   Why does God do this?"
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.540]   But that's a question you're not meant to understand.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.780]   If you think you can understand the mind of God, well, you're already hopeless.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.780]   You never will.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.180]   God is everlasting and eternal.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.120]   He's infinite and he's absolute.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.140]   But men will, and I want to know.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   I want to know this.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.380]   If God's a God of love, why does he allow war?
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.940]   If God's a God of love, why are there spastics?
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.180]   If God, I want to understand, here's a little pygmy man, and he wants to understand the
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.020]   mind of the eternal God.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.400]   He wants to understand God's governance of this world.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.100]   He wants to understand God's ways in every respect.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.980]   And he never will.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.060]   He's tackling the wrong problem.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.260]   Don't you notice how we all tend to do that?
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.700]   Man instead of trying to think about himself and to understand himself, always starts with
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.500]   God and tries to understand God.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.940]   Start with yourself, my friend, before you try to pit your mind against God's ways.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.020]   Tell me about your own ways.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.820]   Why do you keep on doing that thing that gets you down and makes you feel ashamed afterwards?
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.620]   Answer me that first.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.740]   When you can tell me why you behave as you do and live as you do, then, but not until
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.620]   then will you be entitled to try to understand the ways of God.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.780]   No, no, you're not meant to.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.660]   There's an answer to all that in Deuteronomy 29, 29.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:59.060]   The secret things belong to our God, but the things which are revealed belong to us and
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.020]   to our children.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.500]   We are not meant to understand certain things.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.220]   They're beyond us.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.260]   Our minds are too small and they're sinful to boot.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.180]   And we cannot understand.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.340]   We are only meant to understand the things that are revealed.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:19.060]   But man, in his pride of knowledge and in his arrogance, says he's going to encompass
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.340]   God himself.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.140]   He sent a man into outer space.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.900]   Why shouldn't he examine God with a microscope, therefore?
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.180]   Fool that he is.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.900]   He'll soon learn his limitations.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.020]   God granted he may do so before the final calamity comes.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.100]   But then he makes a second mistake.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.620]   Having tried to discover what he's not meant to know, he tries to do so with methods that
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.540]   are totally inadequate.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   But he'll never succeed.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   Listen to the answer given.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:51.260]   "Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of the living."
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.580]   Now man thinks he can find this wisdom.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.820]   He's confident he can.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.300]   He can put his world in order.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.220]   It was League of Nations a few years ago.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.780]   It's United Nations now.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.380]   It's something always this or that.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.380]   Man's always going to...
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.380]   He can bring wisdom.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.460]   He can solve the problem.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.460]   You can't do it.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.460]   No, no.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.660]   It cannot be gotten in that way.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.460]   "Well, surely," says man, "I've got the power.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460]   Where shall I try?
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   Well, now, then, where is this wisdom?
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.460]   Here's the question.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.460]   Where shall wisdom be found?
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.100]   Where is the place of understanding?
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.340]   Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of the living.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.420]   Very well," he says, "if it's not in the land, let me try somewhere else.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.620]   Where can I turn to?
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.500]   Ah, the depths.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.740]   I'll turn to the sea.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.860]   But the depth says it is not in me, and the sea says it is not with me."
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.980]   "Well," says man, "surely gold can buy it.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.300]   Gold can buy anything.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.580]   You can get on in the world if you've got plenty of gold.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.140]   You can get on to the best clubs.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.660]   You can meet the best people.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.980]   You'll meet royalty probably if you've got enough money.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.980]   Gold!
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.340]   Gold is going to do it.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.260]   Listen, it cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.420]   It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx or the sapphire.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.220]   The gold and crystal cannot equal it, and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.980]   of fine gold.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:09.300]   No mention shall be made of coral or of pearls, for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.900]   You go and offer all these things.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.380]   Say, 'Well, will you take this?'
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.460]   'No,' says wisdom, 'I'm not to be bought.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.180]   You'll never get me with your money, nor with all your wealth.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.340]   It's not in the sea.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.340]   It's not on land.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.940]   It cannot be bought with money.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.620]   Do you know not even can it be found in the air?
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:29.500]   Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air."
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.460]   That's where man is turning now, isn't it?
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:36.020]   He's discovered everything on the land as if he's been down in the depths of the sea.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.740]   Air, outer space, conquering the force of gravity.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.940]   Now then, once we get up there, then we'll know how to live and we'll solve our problems.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:45.940]   You won't.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:55.100]   "It is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close even from the fowls of the air.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.660]   It's not to be found in this world.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.500]   Well, surely, says someone as a man gets older, he gets wiser.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.100]   No, he doesn't, says this book of Job.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:09.580]   Days should speak, and the multitude of years should teach wisdom, but they don't.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.660]   Old men can be utter fools.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.420]   They go into a second childhood.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.660]   Age isn't going to give it me.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.860]   Well, what is going to give it me?
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.260]   I don't find it on land.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.700]   I don't find it on the sea.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.380]   I don't find it in the air.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.380]   Money won't buy it.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.100]   Age doesn't bring it.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.820]   Is there anything that's ever heard of it?
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:31.660]   Is there anywhere where I can turn to find an answer to my question?
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.700]   And I'm told there's only one, verse 22.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:47.260]   "Destruction and death say, 'We have heard the fame thereof with our ears, but no more.'
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.700]   No living man can give it me.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:53.700]   The treasures of the sea can't, the treasures of earth, the treasures of heaven.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.700]   No, no.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.540]   There's only one answer that I can get.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:06.820]   Death and destruction say, 'We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.'"
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:07.820]   What does this mean?
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.500]   Oh, I'll tell you what this means.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.500]   The commentary on that verse is to be found in the 16th chapter of the Gospel according
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.740]   to St. Luke.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:23.900]   The parable at the end of the chapter is about Dives, a rich man, and Lazarus, a poor man.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:29.220]   And you're given the picture, you remember, of the rich man in Hades.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.220]   And there he is.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.620]   He'd lived sumptuously all his days, a great man in the world, probably regarded as a very
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.620]   wise man and important man.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.980]   But he's dead, and he's in Hades, and he's in an agony.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:44.400]   But you see, this is the thing that we are told about him.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.820]   He wants to pass from where he is to where poor Lazarus is in the bosom of Abram.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.180]   He can't be done.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:58.620]   Very well, then, he said, "If I am hopeless, if nothing can be done for me, do something
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.700]   about my brethren that are still left in that old world out of which I've just come.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.580]   Send somebody to them.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.180]   My brothers are still living as I was.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.180]   I thought I knew.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.180]   They think they know."
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:16.460]   You see, death and destruction had taught this man something that life and all his knowledge
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.460]   hadn't given him.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:22.300]   Yes, death and destruction do say, "We have heard the fame thereof with our ears."
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.540]   They can't give it, but they'll tell you about it.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.100]   They do know something about it.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.100]   Gold won't help you.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.100]   Silver won't.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.100]   Rubies won't.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.100]   The depths won't.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.100]   The heights won't.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.500]   Death and destruction say, "Yes, I can tell you.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.740]   I know something about it.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.260]   I've heard of it."
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.260]   They can't tell you about it.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.260]   They can't save you.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.740]   They can't give it to you.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.500]   But with Lazarus they can.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.940]   But with Diabes, they can tell you something about it and you'll feel, "Oh, that I could
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.580]   go back and tell people.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.740]   Oh, that somebody could be sent back and give them this wisdom before it's too late.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.940]   Go back and warn those brethren of mine."
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.740]   But that isn't enough, you see.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.740]   That's all.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.740]   No, no.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:07.020]   Man has got to learn that he can never find it.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.480]   Do what he will.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.860]   And so he comes to the last point.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.860]   Modern man will continue as he is and his world will continue as it is and become worse
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:28.700]   until man realizes that there is but one way to find it and to obtain it.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.020]   And here is the answer.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.940]   Behold the fear of the Lord.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   That is wisdom.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:42.320]   And to depart from evil is understanding.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.760]   Wisdom is alone with God.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   Nowhere else.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.000]   "Whence then cometh wisdom?
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.920]   Where is the place of understanding?
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.200]   Seeing it is hid from all, the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   earth."
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.880]   Here is the answer.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:04.180]   "God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof."
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.140]   And then he goes on to give you his arguments as to why this is true.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.580]   He did see it and declare it.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:16.060]   He prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.680]   It's with God and with God alone.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.840]   And it is the gift of God.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.900]   This is what man has got to learn.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:29.660]   "To men," he said, "behold the fear of the Lord."
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.140]   That is wisdom.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:37.580]   And to depart from evil is understanding.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.860]   What does this mean?
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.060]   My dear friend, it is as simple as this.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:51.180]   You have got to submit yourself utterly, entirely, and absolutely to God and his way.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.780]   There is no wisdom apart from that.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.820]   All else is but learning.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.580]   All else is but knowledge and information.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:06.380]   If you want wisdom, if you want understanding, there is only one place in the universe you
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.020]   can find it.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:13.220]   Not in your libraries, not on the earth, not in the sea, not in the heavens.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.900]   Money can't buy it.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.180]   Thank God for this.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.220]   It's the free gift of God.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:27.480]   You can have it for nothing, without money and without price.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.020]   You don't even need ability.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.340]   You don't even need to be a great man.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.700]   You can be an ignoramus.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.280]   You can be an ignorant person.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   You can be a fool.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.220]   But he'll give it to you as a free gift.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:46.100]   The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.100]   What does this mean?
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.020]   Well, you see, the fear of the Lord doesn't mean a craven fear.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.220]   It doesn't mean that you go cowering into a corner.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:59.220]   It means that you just recognize that God is God and you bow before him.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.220]   Oh, here it is.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.860]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   Well, because men who'd been made in the image of God and made perfectly and was put by God
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.260]   in a perfect world ceased to fear God.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.260]   He stood up.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.260]   He said he wanted to be a God.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:19.620]   He listened to the devil and calamity came down upon him and it's continued ever since.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:20.620]   What has man got to do?
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:27.180]   He has nothing to do but to reverse Genesis 3, what men did at the fall.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:33.300]   Instead of standing up to God and saying, "I demand the fruit of this tree of the knowledge
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.420]   of good and evil.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.780]   I want to know as much as God knows."
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:44.380]   Instead of saying that, you get down on your knees and you say, "I'm a fool.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.380]   I'm ignorant.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.380]   I'm poor.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.380]   I'm wretched.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.380]   I'm blind.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.380]   I'm unclean.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.380]   I'm lost.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.020]   I deserve nothing but eternal torment.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:58.860]   Oh God, I realize it's all due to the arrogance and the pride of my intellect and my belief
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.860]   in myself."
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.860]   You humble yourself before God.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.620]   That's the fear of the Lord.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.740]   In other words, you go to God and you say, "I don't know.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.780]   I don't know where I am.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.900]   I don't know what I am.
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.900]   I don't know how to live.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.900]   I don't know how to die.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.700]   I don't know how to face you in the judgment.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.420]   I don't know what to say about the life I've lived."
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:21.500]   "Farewell," says God, "you're now in the very place which I demand before I give you the
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.500]   gift of wisdom."
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.500]   Our Lord put that, you see, in these words, "Except ye be converted and become as little
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.620]   children."
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.340]   Little children.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:38.700]   The modern man with all his vast and gigantic knowledge has just got to admit that he doesn't
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.780]   know what really matters.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.820]   That whether he's a great man or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.820]   He's a fool.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.820]   He knows nothing.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.820]   He's got to come down.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:46.820]   He's a little child.
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.140]   He says, "Well, yes, the Bible's right.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.420]   I obviously need to be born again.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.940]   My thinking's all wrong.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.380]   I've got to start from scratch, from nothing, from nowhere."
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:00.300]   In other words, you realize that all your learning and knowledge is utterly useless
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.900]   and you submit yourself to this revelation.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.780]   You believe this is God's Word.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.740]   And you believe it when he tells you that you are a sinner, that you're damned, and
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:15.460]   that you deserve hell, that you can never put yourself right.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:22.780]   And you believe it when it goes on to say that in spite of that, God so loved the world
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:28.420]   that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.580]   everlasting life.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.700]   Believe in Jesus as the Son of God.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.740]   Believe in the virgin birth, the miracle of the Incarnation.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:38.700]   But I don't understand you say, "Don't try to become a little child.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.140]   You haven't got wisdom.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.140]   Receive it as a gift.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.260]   Believe it as you are because God says it.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:49.540]   The fear of the Lord, submission to his revelation, to his plan of salvation."
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.780]   But you say, "I don't understand how Christ could receive my punishment."
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.380]   Don't try to understand it.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.380]   Believe it.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:02.140]   And then you'll soon begin to understand it and you'll rejoice in it as the greatest
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.020]   and the most wonderful thing that's ever happened.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.860]   You submit yourself to the fear of the Lord, submission to the Bible, to the revelation,
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:15.220]   to the truth concerning God's way of salvation in Christ, Christ being made the sin offering,
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:21.020]   my sins laid on him, God punishing them, delivering me, forgiving me freely, making me his child.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.860]   This is wisdom?
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:30.140]   The fear of the Lord, man acknowledging his ignorance and his utter inability and helplessness,
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.940]   and coming as a little child.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.860]   The fear of the Lord that his wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.540]   You see, the moment you submit to this and believe it, you say, you ask for forgiveness,
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.700]   you acknowledge your sin and all your arrogance and failure.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.780]   You say, "I want to leave all that and all that it belongs to.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.860]   I want to be your dutiful child.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.220]   I want to live to your glory and I want to spend my eternity in your holy presence."
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.220]   That's it.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:08.620]   The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil, that is understanding.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:15.740]   And oh, my friend, if you but believe this, believe me, you'll begin to understand life.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.300]   You'll understand yourself.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.820]   You'll begin to live truly.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   You'll have contentment.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.180]   You'll have satisfaction.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.180]   You'll have peace.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.180]   You'll have joy.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.100]   You won't be afraid if they send all the bombs off together.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.860]   You'll no longer be afraid of death.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.860]   You'll no longer be afraid of the judgment.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:36.380]   You'll even long at times to be in that glorious eternity that God is preparing for all his
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.380]   children.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.380]   That's it.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.380]   Very well, then.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:49.660]   Are you prepared to say tonight with a gracious bonner, "I heard the voice of Jesus say,
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:56.060]   'I am this dark world's light.'"
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:03.260]   Look unto me, thy dawn shall rise, and all thy days be bright.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:09.980]   I came to Jesus, and I found in him my star, my sun.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:18.740]   And in that light of life I'll walk till traveling days are done.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.260]   Have you the wisdom?
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:28.060]   You can have it as a gift freely from God at this very moment if you but acknowledge
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:37.700]   your lack of it, your need of it, and take it and accept it as the free gift of God in
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.700]   his way.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:50.300]   Oh, go in for wisdom, the wisdom of God in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.300]   Amen.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:58.180]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
