[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - By 1945, we were so pissed off at the Japanese.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   We had destroyed their Air Force,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.580]   we had destroyed their Navy, we had destroyed their Army.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.440]   The population of Japan was down
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.920]   to about a thousand calories per person
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.800]   of the worst kind of stuff, buckwheat and weeds
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.340]   and whatever they could find.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.960]   And yet they wouldn't surrender.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.920]   And they still had a million men on the ground
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.420]   in Western Manchuria.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.220]   They only had about a year's worth of bullets left.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.360]   We knew that much,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480]   but that's a long time with a million men.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.120]   With that in mind, and because they felt
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.600]   that the Soviet Union was still neutral
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.440]   on the Eastern Front,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.920]   because it had basically fought the war in Europe.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.560]   We didn't win the war in Europe, the Russians did.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.300]   We didn't enter the war on the ground until June, 1944,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.560]   by which time they were already moving forward
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.060]   against the German forces that had attacked them in '41.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.140]   So we didn't win the war in Europe, the Russians did,
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.380]   but the Japanese just wouldn't surrender.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.580]   And I mean, you could read the documents about the bombs.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.340]   General George Marshall, who was leading the war,
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.560]   was in charge of all the forces,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.980]   had this idea that maybe if we could use these bombs
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.780]   on the beaches before we landed
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.020]   to kill any Japanese defense that was there,
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.700]   maybe they would get the message and be shocked,
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.920]   he said, and to surrender.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.660]   But from the Japanese point of view, as it turned out later,
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.740]   it's a myth that the bombs won the war.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.540]   They contributed to winning the war,
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.240]   but they didn't win the war.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   What won the war was when Stalin finally was convinced
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.540]   that there were such things as atomic bombs.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.080]   He was half convinced these were American pieces
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.920]   of disinformation, that we were feeding the espionage
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   to the Soviet Union to make him spend a lot of money
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.760]   and waste a lot of time for something that didn't exist.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.800]   When the news came back, which it did almost immediately
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400]   from Hiroshima and then from Nagasaki,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.360]   that these things existed, he called Igor Krutatov in
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.240]   and said famously, "Comrade, give us the bomb.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.340]   "You have all the resources of the state at your disposal.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.680]   "Give us the bomb as soon as you can."
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.720]   But up until then, he wasn't so sure.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.280]   He had told Truman and Potsdam that they would invade
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   Manchuria with fresh Soviet forces on the 15th of August.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.840]   And Truman was trying to get him to agree to invade at all.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.600]   And then when word came from New Mexico
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.520]   that the bomb had worked, which it did right in the middle
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.480]   of the Potsdam Conference, Truman then was trying
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.840]   to get Stalin to come in as late as possible
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.120]   because he figured the bombs would end the war
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   before Stalin could take over enough of Japan
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.200]   to divide the country the way Europe was divided.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.680]   He didn't want a Soviet zone and an American zone
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.440]   and a British zone.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.800]   He knew we could do better with the Japanese
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.240]   than the Soviets would do.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.080]   But Stalin, having heard that the bombs really worked,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.120]   moved up the date of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.920]   to the 8th of August between Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.360]   and invaded early.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.260]   I found it very interesting that the conventional air forces
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.900]   on our side staged the largest firebombing raid
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.740]   of the war on the 14th of August after the Japanese
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.580]   were in the middle of their surrender negotiations.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.420]   The air force wanted to get credit for winning the war
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.860]   and they wanted to hold back the Soviets
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.020]   who were advancing down from Sakhalin Island
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.360]   to the northern islands of Japan
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.160]   as well as inward from Manchuria.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.900]   So our bombing was in northern Japan.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.340]   It was like a way of telling the Soviets,
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.700]   "Back off, buddy, we're not gonna let you in here."
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.980]   And then the Japanese leadership, the military leadership,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.420]   which had been adamant that they would fight
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.220]   to the last Japanese, the 100 million, they called it,
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.140]   turned and finally realized that it was futile.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.160]   And with the fresh Soviet army coming into Manchuria,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.260]   with the United States and the British coming in
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.020]   from the west and the south, they were surrounded
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.140]   and there was no reason to continue.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.320]   But the bombs had their effect.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.640]   The Japanese emperor used the bombings
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.300]   of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a reason for entering politics
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.380]   for the first time in Japanese history.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.820]   He had always been a spiritual figure,
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.900]   but he wasn't allowed to kind of vote or veto
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.820]   the political arrangements.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.180]   He stepped forth and said, "We must sue for peace."
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.140]   And in his final imperial re-script on the 15th of August,
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.260]   recorded and played out to the people by radio,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.500]   he said, "A new and most terrible weapon of war
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.300]   has led us to think the unthinkable,
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.180]   and we must now lay down our arms."
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.800]   So the bomb had its effect,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.900]   but it wasn't what we thought at the time.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.900]   The scale of the bombing with one bomb in the case,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.100]   let's say, of Hiroshima was not that different
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.780]   from the scale of the fire bombings
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.180]   that had preceded it with tens of thousands of bombs.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.820]   The difference was it was just one plane.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.380]   People don't seem to realize,
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.940]   and it's never been emphasized enough,
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.660]   these first bombs, like all nuclear weapons,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.440]   were firebombs.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.460]   Their job was to start mass fires,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.760]   just exactly like all the six-pound incendiaries
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.680]   that had been destroying every major city in Japan by then.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.980]   Every major city above 50,000 population
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.380]   had already been burned out.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.020]   The only reason Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.580]   were around to be atomic bombed
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.900]   is because they'd been set aside from the target list
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.500]   because General Groves wanted to know
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.860]   what the damage effects would be.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.300]   The only way that he could study that,
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.500]   obviously the bomb that was tested in the desert
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.560]   didn't tell you anything, killed a lot of rabbits,
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.040]   knocked down a lot of cactus, melted some sand,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.520]   but you couldn't see its effect on buildings and on people.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.900]   A lot of Americans said, "Thank God for the atomic bomb
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.080]   because our voice came home."
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.380]   The actor Paul Newman was a friend of mine,
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.140]   and Paul was an 18-year-old bombardier
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.380]   on a two-man Navy firebomber
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.920]   training for the invasion of Japan.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.080]   He said to me once, "Rhodes, I'm one of those guys
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   who said, 'Thank God for the atomic bomb
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.400]   because I probably wouldn't have come home
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.780]   if we'd invaded the Japanese Hum Islands.'"
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.660]   And a million men said that.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.040]   And the truth is there were so many Japanese
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.920]   who would have been killed if we had invaded
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.320]   that even the killings of the two bombs
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.880]   would have been dwarfed by the killing that happened.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.860]   For the first time in the history of war,
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.040]   more Japanese civilians were killed in World War II
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.580]   than had ever been killed in a war before.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.120]   War was beginning to become what it has since become,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.760]   which is a war against civilians, basically.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
