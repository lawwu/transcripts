[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:15.280]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.280]   John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water; but there standeth one among you whom
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:31.640]   ye know not; and I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.640]   unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.680]   is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.160]   We return, in other words, to our consideration of this great statement made here concerning
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.400]   the baptism with the Holy Ghost or the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.160]   We interrupted our consideration of this theme.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.000]   We last considered it on the 6th of December.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.240]   But now we come back to it again.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.720]   Let me remind you of our reason for considering it in this detailed way and manner.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.600]   It is here, of course, in the very beginning of the Gospel of John.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.080]   We have been reminding ourselves at considerable length that, after all, what we are offered
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:37.600]   by the Gospel is to receive of the fullness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and grace
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   upon added to grace.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.400]   Here is what Christianity means.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.200]   The great question for us is to know whether we have received and are receiving increasingly
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.600]   of this fullness.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.360]   Now John the Evangelist goes on immediately to introduce us to that preliminary ministry
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.200]   of John the Baptist.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.880]   And it is in that way he leads us to an understanding of what it is that makes possible for us to
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.200]   receive of this fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   And it is none other than this very thing which we are considering.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.920]   The difference between John's ministry and that of our Lord, according to John himself,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.760]   is that whereas he, John, baptized with water, our Lord would baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.640]   There is nothing, therefore, that is more important for Christian people than that we
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.960]   should be clear in our minds as to what this means.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.440]   Taking the view which I do, that the great trouble today in the Church, including evangelical
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.120]   people, is that we are living hopelessly below the New Testament standard and pattern, I
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.560]   urge the consideration of this all-important doctrine upon you.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.480]   If I were to be asked to name what is the greatest of all our sins at the present time,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.160]   I would say we are beyond any question that it is the sin of quenching the Spirit.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.440]   We are content with a neat little religion.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.600]   It is Christianity, I am granting that.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.400]   But the question is how does it stand up to the picture that we have presented to us in
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.120]   the New Testament itself.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.440]   There is nothing more important than this from the standpoint of our own personal experiences
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.120]   and from the standpoint of the whole witness and effectiveness of the Christian Church.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.600]   And here it is put before us at the very beginning of John's Gospel.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.840]   This is to be the characteristic of Christ's people.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.040]   Now then, let me remind you of the principles we have been laying down.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.000]   We have laid it down, first of all, that a man can be a Christian without having received
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.860]   this baptism of the Spirit.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.280]   We do not identify it with regeneration.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.600]   We do not say that it is something that happens to all Christians at regeneration.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.880]   And we have given our scriptural reasons for saying that.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.280]   Secondly, we have emphasized that it is something that happens to us, not something that we
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   do.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.040]   It is something that happens to us.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.920]   Christ baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.560]   It is his action.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.720]   And so it is something that happens to us.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.140]   And we have seen numerous examples of that again in the New Testament and in the subsequent
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.520]   history of the Church.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.260]   The third point was that it is something clear and unmistakable.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.280]   You do not take it by faith in the sense of saying, "Well, I feel no different, but
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.760]   having asked and believing, I must have had it."
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   It is not that.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.140]   It is unmistakable.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.760]   It is clear, as it was clear and unmistakable on the day of Pentecost, as it was clear and
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.680]   unmistakable in the household of Cornelius and all the other examples.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.320]   It has always been clear in the testimony and the experience of the saints of the centuries.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.360]   It is the outstanding characteristic of every great revival of religion.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.260]   You know whether you have been baptized with the Holy Ghost or not, and other people know
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.260]   it as well.
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.860]   It is clear and unmistakable.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:43.060]   And then our last point was the fourth, that what this really means is the direct and unusual
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.620]   action of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:54.260]   The work of the Spirit can be divided up into two main sections, the indirect and the direct.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:01.300]   The customary, the normal, if one may use such a term, activity of the Spirit is the
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.900]   indirect one.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.540]   He speaks through the Word to us, preaching, conversation, circumstances, events, and so
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.020]   on.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.060]   That is the normal work of the Spirit, and the normal work of conversion is what I would
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.020]   call this indirect work.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.700]   Of course, regeneration is direct.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.260]   It is his own secret operation down in the depths of the soul.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:31.940]   But speaking generally, we say that the work of the Spirit normally is that indirect.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.540]   But here it is the direct.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.100]   It is this special.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.100]   It is this unusual.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.540]   Now, that statement in Romans 8.16 puts it so well.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.980]   The Spirit also himself beareth witness with our spirits.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.660]   It is his action, and it is a direct action.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.020]   I gave you, again, an exposition of that, and gave you quotations from some of the great
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.580]   writers of three hundred years ago to support that.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.460]   That in addition to the ordinary, there is this extraordinary.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.980]   And that is why I say again that you can be a Christian without this.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.300]   This is something additional.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.700]   And then the last point we made was that it is not primarily a matter of character or
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.480]   of moral qualities.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.340]   People always get confused at this point.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.060]   They tend to confuse this with sanctification.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.120]   Sanctification is concerned about character, about moral quality.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.420]   But this is not primarily.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.740]   And we illustrated that from the example of the Corinthians, the Corinthian church.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.740]   The state of the church is displayed in the first epistle, for instance.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.100]   And yet there were people who were rejoicing in the manifestations of the baptism with
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.340]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.540]   So we must not think of it primarily in terms of moral character.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:04.380]   We must not get confused with Ephesians 5.18, which is concerned solely with sanctification.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.620]   It is such a tragedy that confusion has come in at that point.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.500]   When you are baptized with the Spirit, you are filled with the Spirit.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.200]   But you can be filled with the Spirit without being baptized with the Spirit.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.940]   It is for us to go on being filled with the Spirit.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.440]   It is our duty.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.180]   We must not quench the Spirit.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.740]   We must not grieve the Spirit.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.140]   That is the normal Christian life.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.380]   But here is something over and above that, this given element, this outpouring.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:44.020]   Now then, that brings us to the point of saying again, and elaborating this, that beyond any
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:51.180]   question the primary purpose and function of the baptism with the Spirit is to enable
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:09:00.740]   us to be witnesses to the Lord Jesus Christ and to his great salvation.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.820]   So if we bear this in mind, I think it will help to clear up that confusion that people
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:10.220]   get into in confusing this with sanctification.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.100]   This is primarily a matter of witness.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.100]   Now let me give you some proofs of what I am saying.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:25.700]   Take for instance what our Lord himself told the disciples before his ascension.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   You got it at the end of the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the last chapter of Luke's
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.300]   Gospel, in chapter 24.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.340]   Our Lord is now appearing to the disciples in the upper room.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.740]   And we are told, "Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.780]   Scriptures and he said unto them, 'Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.980]   to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.580]   sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.'"
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.900]   Now then, that's the teaching and they have now got it and understood it and grasped it.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:12.380]   And then he goes on, "And ye are witnesses of these things."
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.940]   And they were of course.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.380]   They had been with him, they had heard the preaching, they had seen him crucified, they
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.420]   had seen him buried, they had seen him risen from the dead with the empty grave, and here
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.540]   he is actually speaking to them in the room.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.820]   They are witnesses.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:33.780]   But he goes on and says, "And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you, but
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:41.900]   tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high."
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.940]   They've got the facts, they believe them, they know them.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:52.100]   But before they can be effective witnesses, they must receive this baptism with the Holy
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.100]   Spirit.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.500]   And then of course, you get virtually the same thing stated again in the first chapter
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.420]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.700]   And being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.300]   from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which saith he, ye have heard
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   of me.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.860]   John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.860]   days hence.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:23.780]   Then, verse 8, "But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you."
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.780]   Power, you see.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.780]   What for?
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:32.660]   "Well, and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.820]   and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.820]   Witnesses.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:43.780]   Now, that's the main purpose of the baptism with the Spirit, to make us witnesses, powerful
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:49.180]   witnesses to the Lord Jesus Christ and his great salvation.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.580]   And of course, you go on through the New Testament and you find that this thing is repeated.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.460]   Take, for instance, the Apostle Peter standing before the authorities.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:05.340]   We read in Acts 5, 29 and following, "Then Peter and the other apostles answered and
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.500]   said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.580]   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom he slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:19.180]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, for to give repentance
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.540]   to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:30.140]   And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.940]   to them that obey him."
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.980]   Now, the coming of the Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, is a witness to these
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   things.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.180]   Now, a witness is not something secret.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.540]   A witness is something public.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.100]   A witness is something that is evident.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.740]   And as you see, on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, when the Holy Ghost ascended upon
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:58.060]   these disciples and the others, the 120 gathered in the upper room, well, the coming of the
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:04.340]   Holy Ghost was a witness.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.340]   The whole of Jerusalem was stirred and disturbed, and the crowd came together.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.340]   "What meaneth this?" they said.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.340]   "What is this?"
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.340]   That's the witness.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.300]   The coming of the Holy Ghost and his effects upon the Christian people is a tremendous
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.300]   witness.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:21.780]   The apostles therefore say, "We are witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost,
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.260]   whom God hath given to them that obey him."
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.340]   And as I have reminded you more than once already, that was the witness that convinced
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.700]   the apostle Peter that Gentiles could be admitted into the Christian Church.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.780]   It took some convincing.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:44.340]   Peter was a Jew, and even though he'd had a vision, he wasn't quite clear about this.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.860]   The vision had convinced him that he must go with these people to preach in the household
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.260]   of Cornelius, but he wasn't clear about it even then.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:57.660]   But when he saw that the Spirit had descended upon these people, even as upon him and the
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.500]   others at the beginning, he said, "Who was I that I could again say this, or refuse them
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.100]   water?"
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:10.060]   The witness of the Spirit, obvious, external, convinced the apostle.
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.340]   And so it is right through.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:18.340]   Now there's another very interesting statement of all this in the second chapter of the epistle
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.660]   to the Hebrews.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:28.260]   The writer is exhorting these people to take heed lest they slip away from these things.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.860]   He says, "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:39.260]   to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?"
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.300]   Then listen, "God also bearing them witness."
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   How?
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.820]   "He will fulfill both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   Holy Ghost, according to his own will."
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.740]   That's another way in which this is stated.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:03.300]   The purpose, the main function of the baptism with the Holy Spirit is to witness, to enable
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:08.860]   God's people to witness in such a manner that it becomes a phenomenon and people are
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.340]   arrested and are attracted.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:19.580]   And in the tenth chapter of that same epistle to the Hebrews, in verse 15, we have the same
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580]   thing.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.060]   "For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified, whereof the Holy
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.100]   Ghost also is a witness to us."
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.420]   That carries exactly the same meaning there.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.040]   Well, very well.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:42.820]   We must therefore hold in our minds, I say, this great, vital, central principle, that
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:51.780]   the baptism with the Holy Ghost is essentially concerned with our witness, to make us witnesses,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.980]   to make us powerful witnesses.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.700]   Now, how does he do this?
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:04.780]   Well, that leads me to what I would call the fifth big division of this whole subject.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:13.180]   What are the marks and signs, or if you prefer it, the results of this baptism with the Holy
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.180]   Spirit?
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.100]   There is no difficulty about this.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:23.820]   It is seen very clearly in all the accounts that we have of the baptism with the Spirit
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.380]   of various people.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:32.000]   Get it perfectly, of course, in Acts 2, in the case of the disciples themselves.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.700]   And you see the difference that the baptism with the Spirit made to them.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.540]   But then you get it in all the other examples and illustrations given everywhere in the
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.620]   New Testament.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.020]   You get it, as I have been showing you, in the epistles.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.020]   It is implicit.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.620]   It is at the back of all the epistles.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.700]   You do not begin to understand the epistles of the New Testament unless you know something
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.100]   about this doctrine of the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.060]   As I put it on one occasion, I believe, how many churches do you know today to whom you
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.420]   need to write the first letter to the Corinthians?
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.060]   Where there were excesses because of this.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.100]   Now, that is the background.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.860]   And so, even in the epistles, it is implicit.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:24.380]   But in addition to that, you get it in the testimonies and lives of innumerable saints
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.740]   throughout the long history of the Christian Church.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.100]   I have quoted some to you.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.020]   I am going to quote more to you, in order that people may see that this is not some
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.620]   new strange new doctrine.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.820]   This is New Testament Christianity.
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.580]   This is what has been true of the Church, especially in all the great revivals that
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.820]   the Church has been privileged to experience and to enjoy.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:52.220]   Now then, what are the marks, what are the indications, what are the signs, manifestations,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:58.380]   if you like, of this baptism with the Spirit?
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.860]   I am going to give you general principles.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.020]   Obviously, there are variations from case to case.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.500]   That is common sense.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.700]   All experiences are not identical.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.100]   They are identical in their character, but they are not identical in their degree.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:24.340]   And this is the most important point again, because it works in two ways.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:30.860]   Some people tend to think that unless you have had the maximum experience, as it were,
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.380]   that you have had nothing at all.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.740]   Well, obviously that is wrong.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.420]   It can depress people.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.980]   There are people who may feel that they have never received this baptism with the Spirit
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.260]   because they have not had certain particular experiences.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.260]   That is quite wrong.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.420]   That is quite false.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:55.220]   We must look at the principle, we must look at the various manifestations as a whole.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.900]   And then, having looked at them as a whole and bearing in mind that there is variation
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:06.940]   in the degree, we shall be able to test ourselves and to examine ourselves.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.340]   Now then, what are these principles?
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.140]   Well, I would say that we can divide them up in two ways.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:20.540]   Certain things which are in us, certain subjective experiences, and then the objective, the things
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:26.220]   that become evident and obvious to those who know us and who are outside us.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.740]   I think that is the most convenient classification.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:40.820]   Now starting with this personal, subjective, experimental consciousness of the individual,
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:47.340]   what is it that happens inevitably when one is baptized by the Lord Jesus Christ with
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.340]   the Holy Ghost?
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:59.260]   Well, first and foremost, I think we have got to put this, a sense of the glory of God,
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:05.820]   an unusual sense of the presence of God.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.980]   This is something, it seems to me, that stands out in all the instances in the New Testament
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:19.420]   itself and in the subsequent history of God's people.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.340]   You see, what the Holy Ghost does is this.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:30.900]   He makes real to us the things which we have believed, the things which we have believed
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:37.460]   by faith, the things of which we have a kind of certainty, but it is a kind of indirect
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.780]   certainty.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.220]   Now the Holy Ghost makes these things immediately real.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.300]   Now let me give you one illustration of this.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.660]   Jonathan Edwards again, I think he brings this out particularly clearly.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:59.020]   He says, "As I rode out into the woods for my health in 1737, having alighted from my
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:04.780]   horse in a retired place, as my manner commonly has been, for a walk, for divine contemplation
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:13.940]   and prayer, I had a view that was for me extraordinary of the glory of the Son of God as mediator
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:23.780]   between God and men and his wonderful, great, full, pure, and sweet grace and love, and
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.580]   meek and gentle condescension.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:34.780]   The grace that appeared so calm and sweet appeared also great above the heavens.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.740]   The person of Christ appeared ineffably excellent, with an excellency great enough to swallow
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:47.740]   up all thoughts and conceptions, which continued as near as I can judge about an hour, and
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:53.820]   which kept me a greater part of the time in a flood of tears and weeping aloud."
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:03.500]   Now my friends, that's what I mean, the sense of the glory of God, the Father and
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.180]   the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:13.300]   Now Jonathan Edwards had believed these things, but as he says, it was extraordinary.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:21.340]   It is possible for us to have an immediate awareness of the glory of God.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.900]   Customarily, we walk by faith and not by sight.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.740]   We believe the testimony of the Scripture, and the Spirit applies it to us, and we know
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.260]   that these things are true.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.060]   But here there is something over and above that.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.220]   You just know that you are in the presence of God.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:48.340]   It's almost impossible, as he says and as others have said, to put these things into
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.340]   words.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.420]   Let me give you one other illustration.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:59.500]   I have quoted Jonathan Edwards, I think beyond any question the greatest philosopher that
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.820]   the United States of America have ever produced.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.180]   That's commonly granted, an outstanding genius.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:13.740]   Let me quote you another man, a man called Thomas Charles Edwards.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:19.460]   He was a man who was the principal of a college in Wales last century.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:27.060]   Again, I mention him because he is the same type of man, an unusually brilliant man.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.780]   Some of you may know his commentary on the first epistle to the Corinthians, and the
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.420]   best education that was available.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.300]   He was a great scholar.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:44.660]   He tells his own experience, it happened to him in a revival in 1859.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.300]   He had heard that he was away from home as a student and as a young man, and he had been
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.940]   reading books on philosophy and theology and so on, and he says that he had got into a
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:59.860]   state in which he was filled with doubts and questionings.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:04.100]   His father was a great man before him and the principal of a theological seminary, but
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.820]   still this young man, he was in trouble.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.100]   He was uncertain, almost, he says, of the very being of God.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.980]   He'd been dabbling so much with philosophy and so on.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.980]   And then he tells the story.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:22.060]   He was home on vacation and he heard it announced in the chapel that on a weeknight the following
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:30.460]   week, two competitively simple preachers from another part of Wales were due to preach in
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.460]   the chapel.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:38.020]   These two men were very much involved in the revival that was then sweeping the country.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.620]   One of them was the instrument used by God to start the revival, if I may use such a
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.340]   term, and the other was his companion.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.280]   They were men in the midst of the revival.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.300]   So this young man decided that he'd go to the meeting.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   And he describes how he went and sat in the gallery.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.900]   And he went, as I say, full of doubts and he was expecting nothing.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.000]   And these two men, after all, were two simple men.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.020]   One had been a carpenter and the other a tailor.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:08.540]   And he had been reading the great philosophers and had been listening to the great lecturers,
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.300]   the leading philosophers of the last century.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.780]   So he went in a somewhat patronizing spirit.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.260]   And as he puts it, he went uncertain, almost, of the very being of God.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.580]   And then he tells us how he left that meeting.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.260]   He doesn't remember all the details, but he says this is the main thing that he does
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:31.460]   know, that when he left that meeting he was more certain of God than he was of even the
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.700]   things he could see with his naked eyes.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.860]   He had met with God.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.340]   He had felt the presence of God.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.820]   He knew that God is.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:51.980]   The glory of God had appeared to him through the ministration of these simple men in that
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.980]   meeting.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.700]   You see, that's a time of revival.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.300]   The Holy Spirit was outpoured.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:03.140]   And this man is carried not only from doubt to belief, but to certainty, to an awareness
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.300]   of the presence and of the glory of God.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.180]   Well, we'll have to leave it at that.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.420]   I could keep you with endless illustrations, almost, of the same thing.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.900]   And accompanying this sense of the glory of God and of his presence, inevitably, is also
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:25.980]   a sense of awe.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:32.460]   You read of people in the Bible who have either a vision of God or who are given something
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.540]   comparable to what I'm talking about, and immediately they're all filled with a sense
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.540]   of awe.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.580]   You remember Isaiah, describing in the sixth chapter of his prophecy how in that year when
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:51.060]   King Isaiah died, he saw the Lord lifted up his vision, and he felt immediately he was
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.060]   a man unclean.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:27:00.420]   Isn't this our trouble, my dear friends, that we talk about God and we believe in God,
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.220]   but do we know God?
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.300]   The glory of God.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:13.160]   You get illustrations of this in the Bible, Moses and the burning bush, the glory which
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.260]   made him stand back, the voice that spoke.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.260]   It's there everywhere.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.020]   John, in the book of Revelation, describes the same thing.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.580]   He fell down as one dead.
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.980]   You remember the apostle Paul having a glimpse of the risen Lord on the road to Damascus,
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.540]   falling down blinded.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.780]   But the Spirit, when the Spirit comes, when we are baptized in this way with the Spirit,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.740]   he makes all this thing vital and real to us.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.660]   There's a kind of luminosity and immediacy.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.540]   It's the great characteristic of being baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:55.220]   Again perhaps we can give you one illustration of this, and I go this time to the case of
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.220]   D.L.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.220]   Moody.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:03.460]   Moody, you remember, had been conscious for some time that there was a lack in his ministry
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.460]   and in his life.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.380]   And he tells us how it happened to him.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.620]   He says, "Well, one day in the city of New York, oh, what a day!
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.780]   I cannot describe it.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.420]   I seldom refer to it.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.940]   It is almost too sacred an experience to name."
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:23.620]   Paul had an experience of which he never spoke for fourteen years.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:31.300]   I can only say, "God revealed himself to me."
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:37.060]   And I had such an experience of his love that I had to ask him to stay his end.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   Now D.L.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:43.460]   Moody was not only a man who had been converted before this.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.780]   He was the head of a mission.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:50.300]   He was a preacher and a successful one, running a Sunday school, a very successful one in
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.940]   Chicago, and his mission church.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.140]   Here is a man, you see, who was as converted as a man could ever have been, and who had
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.700]   a knowledge and an assurance of a kind.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:08.140]   But you see, in the light of this which happened to him in New York City, in Wall Street, it
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.460]   almost becomes nothing.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.420]   "God," he says, "revealed himself to me."
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.100]   And I had such an experience of his love that I had to ask him to stay his end.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:25.820]   As those of you who know his story remember, it was after that that Moody began to be used
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:31.020]   in the way that we know of in this country, in Scotland, and in the United States, and
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.020]   other places.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.820]   It was the turning point in his whole career.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:40.200]   This is the thing that made him the witness that he became.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.980]   But you notice how he describes it.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:53.420]   He puts his emphasis there upon this sense of awe and of majesty, and accompanying it
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.740]   inevitably again is a sense of being humbled.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.900]   This is most important.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.220]   When I come to deal with how to differentiate between the baptism of the Spirit and the
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:12.820]   counterfeits, and there are counterfeits to everything, the devil is subtle and able.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.940]   He can transform himself into an angel of light.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.980]   He is so subtle as almost to be able to receive the very elects as our Lord himself.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.260]   When we come to that, this will be a most important point, that the baptism of the Holy
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:32.740]   Spirit always has the effect of humbling one, because it is a manifestation of God, because
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:40.940]   it is this extraordinary and immediate realization of God's presence, and it humbles.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.780]   Now, this is inevitable.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:48.420]   Let me state this for you in terms of a statement which you will find in the journal of George
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:54.180]   Whitefield for November 5, 1740.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:00.440]   He says, "Mr. Gilbert Tennant preached first, and I then began to pray and to give
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.100]   an exhortation.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:09.220]   In about six minutes, one cried out, 'He is come!
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:19.100]   He is come!' and could scarce sustain the manifestation of Jesus to his soul."
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.060]   This was just an ordinary member of the congregation, remember?
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.980]   This wasn't Whitefield himself, nor Gilbert Tennant, who was also a mighty preacher and
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.980]   used of God.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:34.020]   This was a member of the congregation, suddenly crying out after six minutes, 'He is come!
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:39.860]   He is come!' and could scarce sustain the manifestation of Jesus to his soul.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:47.700]   The eager crying of others for the like favor obliged me to stop, and I prayed over them
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.940]   as I saw their agonies and distress increase.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:57.860]   At length we sang a hymn and then retired to the house, where the men that received
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:04.060]   Christ continued praising and speaking of him till near midnight.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:12.500]   My own soul was so full that I retired and wept before the Lord under a deep sense of
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:22.020]   my own vileness and the sovereignty and greatness of God's everlasting love.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.920]   Most of the people spent the remainder of the night in prayer and praises.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.900]   It was a night much to be remembered.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:36.980]   Now George Whitefield was one of the saintliest men that has ever trod the face of this earth.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:42.340]   He was outstanding in his saintliness, but you see the effect of this experience upon
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.520]   him there, and he'd had it before.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.940]   This was just a repetition of what he'd had previously.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:53.140]   He says, "My own soul was so full that I retired and wept before the Lord under a deep
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:33:06.860]   sense of my own vileness and the sovereignty and greatness of God's everlasting love."
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:13.660]   My friends, if you say and if you argue that every Christian has been baptized with the
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.460]   Holy Ghost, well then I ask you this question.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.220]   How often have you had that sort of experience?
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.400]   Have you ever had it?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.660]   Be careful.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:32.380]   If you postulate that every Christian of necessity has been baptized with the Holy Ghost, I'm
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:37.740]   afraid you'll have to come to the conclusion that there are very few Christians in the
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.180]   Christian church.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:46.420]   This is what happens when a man is baptized with the Holy Ghost, this immediacy.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:53.180]   This is not reason, this is not faith, this is action taking place upon us and to us.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.780]   It's a manifestation.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:06.300]   It is God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit making themselves real to us and living in our very
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   experiences.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   Well then we go on.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:20.980]   The other pronounced characteristic always is an assurance of the love of God to us in
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.540]   Jesus Christ.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.540]   This is most important.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:33.700]   An assurance, I say, of the love of God to us in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.580]   These things are most remarkable.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.260]   On the one hand you see you have such a conception of the glory and the greatness and the majesty
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:47.940]   of God, your own vileness and filthiness and foulness and unworthiness.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.060]   Well you say it must be a most depressing experience.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.060]   It isn't.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:58.580]   For at the same time you have an overwhelming knowledge given to you of God's love to you
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.100]   in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:08.980]   Now I would say personally that this is the greatest and most essential characteristic
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.220]   of the baptism with the Spirit.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.380]   He makes us witnesses because of our assurance.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.180]   That's his way of making us witnesses.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:23.660]   Have I ever told you of what I once read in a paper which, I must confess, searched me
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.440]   to the very depth of my being?
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.800]   It was an account of a meeting held in Glasgow a number of years ago.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.240]   The report of the meeting was given by Alexander Gehry, who was a well-known religious writer,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.040]   but he also wrote on political meetings and so on.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   He described a meeting in the St. Andrew's Hall in Glasgow.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   He was listening to two men speaking, and speaking on the same theme.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.320]   But this is how he put it.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.640]   He said they were both excellent speakers, very eloquent, able men, able to marshal their
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.680]   arguments, state their case, and so on.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.600]   But he said, "I felt there was one great difference between the two men."
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.080]   He said, "The first man spoke as an advocate.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.680]   The second man spoke as a witness."
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.680]   That's the difference.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.160]   The first, you see, was like a barrister.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   He got his brief.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   He was an advocate.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.760]   Here is the case, and he stated it, and stated it so well, and he believed his case.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.160]   But the second man had got something additional.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   There was a plus.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.440]   He was a witness.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.640]   Now the thing that makes a man a real witness is his assurance of these things.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.840]   You can be a Christian without that.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.540]   You can have believed the Scriptures.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.080]   You can have read it and believed it.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.400]   You can have heard it, preached it, and believed it, and you can have a kind of certainty with
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   respect to it.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.440]   But that isn't the thing that made the apostles witnesses.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   Here they are.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.640]   Our Lord tells them, "You are witnesses of these things."
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   Of course they were.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.900]   They had been with him, and there he is in the upper room with them.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:01.640]   But he says, "You know, you can't be witnesses for me until there is absolute certainty."
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:08.320]   And of course, this is the thing that is so evident and obvious in their whole life and
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.160]   experience after the day of Pentecost.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.880]   You notice that even in the first chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, these
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.720]   men, though they've had such instruction and such an opportunity, are still a bit muddled.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.640]   They say, "Are you going to restore the kingdom of Israel at this time to us?"
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.120]   Still that old materialistic thinking.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.200]   There was a kind of uncertainty, but all that disappears after the baptism with the Holy
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   Spirit.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.440]   They are different men.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.280]   They speak with an assurance and a certainty.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.240]   Now let's put it, therefore, like this.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.120]   The baptism with the Spirit is that which gives us the highest form of assurance.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:57.720]   There are, on the whole, three types of assurance possible to the Christian.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:04.780]   The first type of assurance is the assurance that he gets by deduction from the Scriptures.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.680]   This is the commonly recognized form of assurance.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   You've all heard it.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.560]   It has probably been said to you.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.280]   You've been troubled as to whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.760]   And you go in your trouble to a minister or to some Christian friend, and they say, "Now,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.840]   but wait a minute.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.360]   You shouldn't be confused like this.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.520]   The thing is quite simple."
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.600]   They say, "Do you believe the Scriptures to be the word of God?"
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   "Yes," you say, "I do."
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.640]   "Well, very well," they say, "this is what the Scriptures say.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.760]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.320]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   Do you believe?"
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   "I do."
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.040]   "Very well, then, you shall not perish, but you have everlasting life.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.480]   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.960]   He that believeth on him is not condemned.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   You believe?"
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   "I do."
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   "Well, you're not condemned then."
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.120]   "But he that believeth not is not condemned because he hath not believed in the name of
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.600]   the only begotten Son of God."
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.960]   And they say, "Well, there you are.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.460]   If you believe the Scriptures, you've got to believe them."
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.800]   And they say that because you believe, you're not condemned, you're saved.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   You must be saved.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.360]   Don't worry about your feelings.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.160]   Believe the bare word of God.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.400]   And that's all right, perfectly right.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.240]   That is something we all must do.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.880]   But I venture to describe that as the lowest form of assurance.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.640]   It is a form of assurance, but it's the lowest form.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   What is the second?
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:36.800]   Well, the second form of assurance is the kind of assurance that is dealt with in the
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.240]   first epistle of John.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:46.120]   John tells us there in the thirteenth verse of the fifth chapter of that first epistle
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:52.600]   that his whole object in writing to those people was that they might know, that you
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.920]   who believe on the Son of God might know that you have eternal life.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.440]   The whole thing is concerned with assurance.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.560]   Well, how does he give it to them?
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.640]   Well, he gives it to them like this.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:09.560]   He says there are various tests which you can apply to yourselves.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.080]   And you remember the tests.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.160]   Some people have described that epistle as, say it can be called the tests of life, the
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.600]   familiar one, the commonest of all is this.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:26.000]   We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.560]   Now this is a better test than the first one.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.840]   While the first one is valid, the danger is that you may say, "Oh yes, but is this
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.720]   only an intellectual assent that I'm giving?
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.880]   Am I only doing it with my mind?"
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.080]   Now here's a more thorough test because it examines your total reaction to the truth
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.480]   you claim to have believed.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.620]   You love the brethren.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.720]   You can say quite honestly that you'd sooner be with the brethren than anybody else, that
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.920]   you have found that people whom you don't like by nature you can love as Christians
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.680]   because they're with you children of God.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.000]   Love the brethren.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.280]   We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   And if you do find yourself loving the brethren, you can be sure that you are a child of God.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.400]   You know that.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.040]   You know that nothing else would make you love such people and enjoy their company but
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.840]   this fact that it's happened to them and to you and you're aware of this thing that
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.960]   you're sharing together, this participation in the life of God.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.480]   And you apply the other tests as well.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   His commandments are no longer grievous.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.040]   He has given us of his Spirit.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.800]   We have an unction and an anointing and the understanding and so on.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.880]   Well there they are.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.040]   Work them out for yourselves.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.120]   That is what I call the second type of assurance.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   But there is a third type of assurance.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:04.520]   And this is the highest and this is the most absolute and this is the most glorious.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.800]   And it differs essentially from the other two.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   How?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.720]   Well like this.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:17.560]   You notice that in the first two types of assurance that what we are doing is to draw
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.240]   deductions.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.540]   We read the scriptures, we draw deductions.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:30.880]   We arrive at the assurance by a process of reading, understanding, self-examination,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.000]   self-analysis if you like.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.320]   It's a deduction that we draw from the premises given.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.280]   And it's right, it's true.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.560]   But the glory of this third and highest type of assurance is this, that it is not anything
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.360]   that we do.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.540]   It is not any deduction that we draw.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:58.480]   It is an assurance that is given to us by the Blessed Spirit himself.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:07.280]   Now if you like, it is the whole difference between Romans 8.15 and Romans 8.16.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.600]   Romans 8.15 reads like this.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:17.840]   "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage against fear, but ye have received the spirit
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.720]   of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:28.520]   Then 16, "The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit."
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.040]   The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   Our spirit has been crying "Abba, Father!"
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   But over and above that, the Spirit now beareth witness with our spirits.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.680]   He confirms ours.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.880]   He says, "You're right, the Spirit does it."
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.400]   Now this isn't our action.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.400]   This isn't our deduction.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.000]   This is the immediate witness of the Spirit.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.600]   And that is why it is so absolute, and that is why it is so certain.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.000]   And what the Spirit does is this.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.640]   He tells us in the most unmistakable manner that we are the children of God, that God
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:14.500]   loves us with an everlasting love, and that it was because he so loved us that Christ
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.280]   gave himself for us.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   Now how does he do this?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.160]   Well, I've got to come to that later.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.160]   He does it in many ways.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.920]   Sometimes he'll do it through a verse of Scripture, a verse you may have read a thousand
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:29.240]   times, but suddenly it seems to stand out, it's for you.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.120]   He's speaking to you.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.880]   Sometimes it's without even a verse of Scripture.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.200]   It is an impression upon the mind and in the heart.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.480]   You don't hear an audible voice, you don't see anything, but you just know with an absolute
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:51.440]   certainty that it is the Spirit bearing witness with our spirits that we are the children
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.320]   of God.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:03.240]   Let me close on this particular point by putting it to you again in the form of the experiences
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.600]   of certain people.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.460]   Let's start with an old Puritan who died in 1623.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.180]   This is how he put it, Edward Elton.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.100]   I take it, therefore, he says that the witness and testimony of the Spirit here spoken of
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:26.540]   is an inward, secret, and unspeakable inspiration of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God inwardly,
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:32.860]   secretly, and in an unspeakable manner informing our hearts and inwardly persuading us that
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:39.940]   God is our Father, and pouring into our heart a secret, wonderful, and unspeakable sweet
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.900]   sense and feeling of God's love to us.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:49.860]   Not of God's ordinary or common love, but of his special and fatherly love, that God
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:55.540]   loves us with such love as he bears to his only begotten Son, Christ Jesus, in whom we
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.780]   are adopted to be his children.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:03.420]   As the Lord Jesus himself speaks in that excellent prayer of his, John 17, 23, that God loves
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.700]   us, we believing in Christ as he has loved us.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:12.900]   And to this purpose, the apostle speaks plainly, Romans 5, 5, the Holy Spirit of God given
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:21.220]   to us doth infuse and pour into our hearts a sense and feeling of God's love to us in
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.220]   Christ.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:29.400]   Let me read to you, out of the journals of a man called Howell Harris, mightily used
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.500]   of God two hundred years ago.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:42.540]   There was a man who was convicted at the time of Easter, Good Friday, in 1735.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.260]   Then he went through an agony of conviction and uncertainty.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:52.860]   Which Sunday, the same year, 1735, he was given the knowledge that his sins were forgiven.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.860]   He believed, he rejoiced.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:04.940]   Three weeks later, after his conversion, after he had received a quiet assurance of
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:10.540]   salvation, he received a further experience.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:15.180]   He had gone to retire to the clock tower of a certain church.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:20.820]   He went there in order that he might have peace to read the scriptures and to pray.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.620]   And while he was there, this is the kind of thing that happened.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.260]   The biographer writes he recorded everything.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.860]   And after two to three weeks, he recorded everything.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:43.940]   He could do that without any offense to the reader at first because his heart was dancing
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.300]   in the warmth of his first love.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.580]   After two to three weeks, that love burst forth into a flame which melted his whole
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.940]   nature.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:00.420]   The experience of forgiveness which he had had in the church at Talgoth was undoubtedly
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   sweet.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:07.820]   Nevertheless, it left in his heart an indefinable sense of some further need.
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:13.700]   But while he was engaged in secret prayer in the church at Langhasti, that sacred place
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:21.620]   where he had given himself to God, God now gave himself to him.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:27.940]   And there, he scarcely knows how to describe what happens, he piles the richest biblical
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:33.300]   phrases one on top of the other in an attempt to give adequate expression to what he felt
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.820]   and experienced that day.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.620]   That was when his heart was cleared from all idols and the love of God was shed abroad
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.620]   in his heart.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:47.180]   Christ had entered in before, but now he began to sup.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:52.180]   Now he had received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and he began to
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.900]   desire to depart and to be with Christ.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:00.940]   All fears were cast out from once and perfect love took their place.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.780]   And he never forgot that day.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:08.980]   It was from that day that this man again began to be such a remarkable and outstanding witness
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.420]   and testified to the grace and to the love of God.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:20.780]   And he describes how this love of God came upon him in wave after wave after wave.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.500]   Another man called Christmas Evans does exactly the same thing.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.100]   Those of you who have read the autobiography of Charles Finney will know that he says exactly
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.660]   the same thing again.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.340]   Now this is what I mean by this highest form of assurance, the spirit bearing witness with
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.820]   our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:45.420]   It's direct, it's immediate, not our deduction, but this absolute certainty, the spirit telling
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.940]   us that we are children of God.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:53.140]   Let me finally tell you again what I regard as one of the most beautiful ways in which
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.060]   this matter has ever been put.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:01.420]   And it was put by Thomas Goodwin, one of those great Puritans again of three hundred years
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.260]   ago.
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:11.180]   The president of Magdalene College at Oxford during the Commonwealth, a brilliant scholar
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.340]   and preacher, he puts it like this.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:21.500]   This is the difference between what I call the customary assurance of the child of God
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.100]   and this extraordinary assurance.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.900]   He describes a man and his little child, son, walking down the road, and they're walking
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.340]   hand in hand.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.380]   And the child knows that he's the child of his father, and he knows that his father loves
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.660]   him, and he rejoices in that, and he's happy in that.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.540]   There's no uncertainty about it at all.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:48.260]   But suddenly the father, moved by some impulse, takes hold of that child, picks him up, fondles
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.900]   him in his arm, kisses him, embraces him, showers his love upon him.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.220]   And then he puts him down again and they go on walking together.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.500]   That's it.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:05.940]   The child knew before that his father loved him, and he knew that he was his child.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:13.420]   But oh, this loving embrace, this extra, this outpouring of the love, this unusual manifestation
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.300]   of it, that's the kind of thing.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:24.500]   The spirit bearing witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:31.540]   This, I say, is the outstanding characteristic of a baptism with the Spirit.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:37.500]   God, give us grace to examine ourselves in the light of these things.
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.180]   I take it you've all got the first and the second types of assurance?
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:46.100]   Do you know anything about the third?
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:53.620]   Do you know anything of the glory of God, this immediacy, this certainty, this absolute
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:52:00.580]   assurance given by the Spirit that banishes all doubt and uncertainty?
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:09.220]   And you know that God loves you in particular with an everlasting love in Jesus Christ.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:15.940]   Well, we shall have to continue with our examination of these manifestations and results of the
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.140]   baptism with the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.300]   Now let us sing our closing hymn, hymn number 428.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   428.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.580]   Oh, love divine, how sweet thou art.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.460]   When shall I find my willing heart?
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.860]   All taken up by thee.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.500]   428.
