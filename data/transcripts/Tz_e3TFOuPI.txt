[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   It's probably best to just like use the guides that are there to do your own
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.000]   discovery.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Finding what's best is sort of ridiculous.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.880]   For example, if you go to Tokyo and you go to any of the really sushi expert
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.360]   aficionados that I know, if you say, Hey, I want to go to the best sushi
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.360]   restaurant, they're going to erase you from their phone.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.840]   Cause it's just like, you're just a dumb ass to them.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.840]   It's so overreductive.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.120]   I think what they want to say is like, do you understand the nuance and to
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.880]   understand that at any given moment, there might be like five to seven serving
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.000]   the best stuff that night.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.120]   So a lot of it is like the feeling, the price range, right.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.560]   And I think doing the homework never hurts, but the best thing to do is.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.760]   Just to go out there and do it yourself.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.800]   And I think the hard thing clearly is people are on a budget and they,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.640]   they can't go eat out all the time.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   So I think at that degree, it really doesn't hurt to go to the places
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.600]   that are like tried and true.
