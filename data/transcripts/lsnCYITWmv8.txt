[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Very perceptive question has come in
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.120]   from a podcast listener named Matt.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840]   He asks this, "In episode 313, Pastor John,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.580]   "you said that there was one period
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.300]   "when 230 people left your church
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.280]   "and the church didn't grow for years after that.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.180]   "What happened there
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480]   "and what did you learn from the experience?"
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.920]   - Yeah, I often make clouded reference
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.920]   to that season in our church's life
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   and it might be helpful to say a little more about it here
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   and then just a few lessons at the end.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   This is very delicate and I must be careful
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.160]   because I suspect that people who were deeply wounded
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.900]   and deeply complicit in those events
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.380]   will listen to this podcast.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640]   And so I wanna start by saying,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.240]   I don't speak out of any remnants of anger
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.600]   or vengeance that I know of.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.860]   I mean, the heart is corrupt
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.280]   and I'm deceived often about myself,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.680]   but as much as I know myself,
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.340]   my heart is right about this
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.300]   and I bear no one any lurking grudges.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.400]   As much anger has there has been in the past,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.960]   I want those who listen to this to hear that.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.520]   I want to say to the people who listen,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.800]   who know what I'm talking about
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.920]   and were there and were involved,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.320]   I don't want to go to my grave
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.740]   with any bitterness or unforgiveness in my heart.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.580]   Here's what happened.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.980]   Two of our staff members committed adultery together
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.440]   and I was the person who discovered it.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.860]   Only that discovery was circumstantial for several weeks.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160]   In other words, I couldn't prove it.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.880]   This is a horrible position to be in.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.880]   I was profoundly convinced it was happening.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.040]   The close friends of the couple were horrified
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.080]   that such an accusation would be made.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.360]   They saw it as unjust and they saw the beauty
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.480]   of our staff unity being destroyed by me.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.080]   And even if it never would be proved
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.900]   or never could be validated,
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.600]   the staff unity would be destroyed.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.960]   I mean, I had ruined it and believe me,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.080]   I can understand their perspective.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.240]   We had enjoyed something so wonderful together
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.440]   and here was John Piper making these accusations
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.080]   and undermining the very essence
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.680]   of what we had all loved for so long.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.400]   Now that went on for several weeks
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.680]   while tensions increased, not publicly,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.560]   the church as a whole didn't know at this moment,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   but dozens did behind the scenes.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.440]   And then in mercy to everyone, they confessed
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.640]   to an extended season of adultery.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.180]   And you might think that this would reverse
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.260]   everyone's feelings toward me,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.760]   but things never worked that way.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   And for some, I was seen not as now being truthful,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.300]   but as gloating in my vindication.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.820]   Then the process of discipline set in,
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.640]   the elders had long and careful prayerful meetings
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.440]   and I believe we handled it in a right and biblical way.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.760]   But whenever anything like this happens,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   there are people who are always unhappy with the process
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.600]   and the attitudes of those involved.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.080]   And so it was disapproved in many ways.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.440]   And from a distance of 20 years now,
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.400]   I am profoundly thankful for God's grace
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.040]   in getting us through because the two who were involved
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.480]   did not destroy their marriages.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.040]   Their spouses were unbelievably gracious.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.560]   There was restoration, neither couple divorced.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.260]   They are with their original spouse.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.640]   And to me, that is not owing to me,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.480]   it's owing to God in his great grace
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   towards all of us and I thank him for it.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   But the hurt that was caused was simply profound
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.240]   and it came from many different angles.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.840]   Some felt the discipline wasn't handled lovingly enough.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.280]   Some were simply crushed by a man
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.640]   that they had been helped by for so long.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.880]   Some were angered that in the process,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.000]   we decided not to purchase an organ
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.320]   that we were going to purchase
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.760]   and they felt that was an unnecessary fallout of this.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.520]   They felt my attitude wasn't what it should be
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.120]   and on and on, the wounds were many.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.560]   And that's the reason you had this 230 or so people
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.400]   who left the church.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.520]   And as I look back,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.280]   I don't want to claim sinlessness in my attitudes.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.600]   I did my best.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.000]   I feel in general that we followed the biblical guidelines
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.440]   with the right spirit, but the heart is deceitful
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   and I don't want to bring about any barriers
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.560]   by claiming more than I should for myself.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.360]   Lots of good reconciliation has happened.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   People should be encouraged.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.760]   I mean, I have been with the people.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.320]   Lots of counseling happened,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.160]   lots of redemptive work happened.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.040]   And even more recently, I have had meetings
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.920]   even to reaffirm that the air is cleared
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.480]   and we're able to face each other on the last day
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.440]   without any sense that we didn't make this right
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.480]   while we were on the earth.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.560]   So what did I come away with?
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.760]   Let me just mention one,
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.760]   tend your heart, I'm speaking to pastors I suppose now,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.680]   tend your heart and know the souls
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.720]   of your partners in ministry.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.520]   Pursue anything that looks like a cooling or distancing,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.840]   go after it.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.560]   Number two, care for the wives of your staff
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.000]   and listen to them.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.040]   Sometimes their intuitions are better
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.280]   than our discernments as to what might be happening
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   in their spouses on staff.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   Number three, follow the Bible in discipline lovingly
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.560]   and know that the devil will distort everything.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.440]   Number four, don't walk away in the season of winnowing.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.880]   We didn't grow for four, well, three years.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.640]   The fourth year became the year of turnaround.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.720]   We didn't grow at all.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.840]   One was a year of weeping while we just did damage control.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.040]   One was, and healing.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   One was, two were, I would say, two years of who are we,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.960]   identification efforts.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.040]   And then a fourth year where God in great mercy
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   lifted the hand of discipline and we took off again.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.080]   So if I had walked away during that time,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.320]   I have no idea what might become of Bethlehem.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.160]   It just would not have been a thing for a father to do
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.520]   or a husband to do or a shepherd to do.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   It's not what to do when your church is wounded
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.960]   to walk away from them.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.000]   And so don't walk away.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.160]   - Thank you, Pastor John, for that.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.360]   And thank you for not walking away
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.640]   from the church during that season.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.640]   This episode was based on a question
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.080]   from podcast listener, Matt,
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.040]   after hearing episode number 313,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.320]   marriage challenges and Christian ministry.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.800]   That was episode number 313.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.280]   Be sure to check that out.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.080]   Thank you listeners for your attentiveness
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.360]   and excellent email questions like this one from Matt.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.760]   Please continue to send those questions to us via email
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.880]   Tomorrow we're back to talk about
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.640]   what a Christian couple is to do
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.480]   when the memories of past sexual mistakes
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.880]   haunt their wedding.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.320]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.920]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.080]   (upbeat music)
