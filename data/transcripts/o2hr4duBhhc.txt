[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   In the Bruce Effect, when you expose a pregnant mouse at an early critical stage of the pregnancy,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   I think up to about day three, if you expose the pregnant mouse to the order of what is
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.860]   referred to in technical terms as the non-stud male, that is a male who did not father the
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.300]   pregnancy, she will miscarry the pregnancy. She will abort it. Now, that's an insane decision
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.500]   made by the female here, right? Because she's invested quite a lot in this, right? In biological
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.120]   terms and in forming this pregnancy and maintaining it. And yet she drops it on the basis of an odor.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.540]   And this effect is remarkably robust. And what do I mean by remarkably robust? So this will occur
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.620]   on about 80% of exposures. Now, as you know, 80% is 100% in biology, right? I mean,
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.660]   there's nothing that happens at more than 80%. So it's a remarkably robust effect, this dropping
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.740]   of the pregnancy. And we know it's mediated by chemo sensation through the nose.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.580]   For sure. And we know in the following way. So first, it's enough to just bring the odor of the
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.460]   non-stud male. You don't have to bring the male himself, right? So you just can bring bedding from
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.380]   a non-stud male and that will induce the Bruce effect. But of course, the most telling set of
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.300]   experiments is that if in the female mouse, you ablate the vomeronasal organ, you just burn this
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.220]   tiny structure in the nose, and the effect disappears. So the effect is completely dependent on the former
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.980]   nasal organ. And I find this utterly a remarkable effect, right? I mean, because again, because of the
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.380]   extent of cost that the female takes on here, based on this information and smell.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.420]   Now, humans, the sort of the going notion in olfaction is that humans don't have a functional
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.940]   vomeronasal organ. So we don't have that functional organ in our nose. Now I'll point out, we actually do
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.940]   have the pit. So the structure or the outlining structure is there. But the pit that we have is
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.220]   considered vestigial and non-functional. And what about this thing I learned about at Berkeley in
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.300]   integrative biology class that we have something called Jacobson's organ? This is the same organ.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.500]   So Jacobson organs is the vomeronasal organ. It's also called Jacobson because I think Jacobson was a
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:51.220]   military physician in like the 1800s in Holland or something. And he found it in a soldier he was
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.820]   operating on or something like that. But the story comes from something like that. But the Jacobson
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.340]   organ is another name for the vomeronasal organ. These are one in the same, the sensory organ of the
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.540]   accessory olfactory system. And again, the going notion is that the human Jacobson organ or vomeronasal organ
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.580]   is vestigial. It's non-functional. Does that necessarily mean that we don't have these pheromone
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.860]   effects? No, it does not. So first of all, we know that lots of what are considered pheromonal effects,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.260]   namely social chemo signaling in rodents, are mediated by the main olfactory system. We know that for sure.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.220]   There are several examples for this in mice and rats and rabbits and so on and so forth. So A,
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.180]   these can be mediated by the main olfactory system. And I'll come back to that in a second. But first to
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:49.620]   finish the Bruce effect. And second, and I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm willing to take that risk.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:59.300]   For me, the jury is still out on human vomeronasal organ. The decision or the notion
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:08.900]   that it's non-functional relies on about one and a half papers, post-mortem, looking for the nerve
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.740]   that connects this thing to the brain and failing to find it using staining and so on and so forth. But
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.020]   staining post-mortem studies in humans are notoriously complicated.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.700]   Basically, you know, for many reasons, one of them is that the material is just always
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.180]   has gone through, you know, it's not ideally set as it is when you sacrifice an animal and
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:42.820]   and study its tissue. So based on really, really a paucity of studies that fail to find
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:51.140]   this nerve, the notion is that the structure is vestigial in humans. I don't have any evidence that
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:05:00.180]   it's functional, mind you, but I'm just not sure that it's not. But what we do have a suspicion
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:11.060]   is that humans may experience something similar to Bruce effect. So, first of all, humans have an
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.140]   enormous number or ratio of spontaneous miscarriage.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.580]   - Are they occurring more often in the first trimester? Because you mentioned that in the Bruce
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.300]   effect in the mice is in the first three days or so following pregnancy, which in the mouse gestation,
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   as I recall, is about 21 days in the mouse. You're talking about one seventh of total gestation. So,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.020]   I'm not quick enough to, nor is it important to translate, but this would be first trimester.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.780]   - Yes, which is indeed when most miscarriage occurs. Now, humans have, again, a huge number of miscarriages
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.340]   and the numbers, I'll soon share them with you, they sound odd. And the reason they sound odd is because
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.500]   if you have what's sometimes simply referred to as failed implantation, right, this can occur, you know,
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:05.140]   in days one, two, nobody ever knows. Okay, so some papers talk about 90% of all human pregnancies end
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.020]   in miscarriage. This is counting a failed implantation in day one, two, et cetera. More conservative studies
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:21.460]   talk about 50%. Nobody will argue 30%. Okay, so a huge number, a huge number of human pregnancies end in
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:30.420]   miscarriage. Now, out of these, there's a portion that are unexplained, right? So nobody knows why.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.500]   I mean, there are portions that are explained by all sorts of genetic factors, developmental factors,
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.780]   and so on and so forth. But there's also a proportion that are unexplained. And so all I'm saying is that
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:49.140]   there's a statistical backdrop or setting, if you will, for something like a remnant Bruce effect in humans.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:07:00.020]   Now, with that in mind, we approached a group of, we enlisted a group of, they're not really patients
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.340]   and participants in a study of people who couples who are experiencing what is referred to as is
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:14.980]   unexplained repeated pregnancy loss. So formally, if you have two consecutive unexplained miscarriages,
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.700]   then that is sufficient for the diagnosis of unexplained repeated pregnancy loss. However,
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:30.420]   in our cohort of 30, we had couples who experienced 12 consecutive unexplained repeated pregnancy losses.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.300]   So the two is just the formal, all of our cohort was like 12, five, you know, so this is an emotional,
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:45.860]   difficult place to be. And these are couples who are losing their pregnancy for no apparent reason.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.820]   So they've gone through all the tests that you can imagine of, you know, genetic incompatibilities and
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:59.540]   all sorts of issues, clotting, all the known suspects for pregnancy loss. And the medical establishment remains
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:06.260]   totally at a loss as to why these pregnancies aren't holding. And so we hypothesized that,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.780]   that perhaps here, there's something akin to a Bruce type effect. Obviously, it's not going to be the same
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.940]   as in mice, but, but something like a Bruce effect. Now, of course, at that stage, we could not do anything
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:25.780]   causal to test this, right. But what we could do is to see, you know, to seek circumstantial evidence to see if,
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.500]   if where there's fire, maybe there's smoke. And what we did was we tested,
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   all faction and more specifically, the response to male body odor in, in the couples experiencing
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:53.220]   repeated pregnancy loss. And we found a few things. First of all, if you think of the mechanisms behind
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.780]   the Bruce effect, the Bruce effect implies that the female has to have a very clear memory
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:06.980]   of the fathering male, because if she's going to miscarry in response to the nonfather, she has to
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:15.140]   know father, nonfather. I mean, that means that there's a pronounced olfactory memory at the moment
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.860]   of mating. Okay, and in mice, this has been very well characterized and attributed to the anterior
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:30.420]   olfactory nucleus structure in the brain. But you'd have to have this memory in order to make
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.940]   that decision. Now, so to address that, and here you're going to see that you and your childhood
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:43.700]   story from before stand out a bit as skillful, is that the first thing we did was just behaviorally test
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:54.260]   whether these women and control women could identify the smell of their spouse.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:03.780]   And you might be disappointed or, you know, we would all are probably a bit disappointed to learn
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:11.540]   that control women are very poor at this. So you would think that women would be good at identifying
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:22.580]   the body odor of their spouse. They're not. They're not far from chance. However, the women who experience
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:29.780]   uh, repeated pregnancy loss are more than, they're, they're double, um, at their performance level.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:36.180]   So this is not a nuance effect. Uh, women who, who, who, who experience repeated, uh, pregnancy loss
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:42.020]   can identify, uh, their husbands or their spouses, uh, by their body odor.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:48.660]   With much greater acuity than the typical person? Double. A bit more than double. And, and way above
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.180]   chance. Yeah, no, I, I, sorry, I posed it as a question, but I meant, yes, with much greater acuity,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:01.620]   uh, and double is, is a significant, um, improvement. Are they much better at detecting any odor?
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:09.460]   No, they're not. We did the controls and they're not. And then, um, we also measured using fMRI. We
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:17.620]   measured their, their brain response to, uh, stranger male body odor. And there, and, and, and this was
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:23.220]   quite remarkable because, you know, we approached, so this was a full brain analysis. So without a region
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.580]   of interest analysis. So it's not as if you're, uh, tweaking your statistics to look at one part of the
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.140]   brain, you're just looking at the entire brain in the response to male body order and asking,
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.380]   de novo, is there a difference between these two groups of participants? And there was one huge
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:43.060]   difference and it was in the hypothalamus. And so there was a difference in response to stranger male
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:52.900]   body order, uh, between the two groups. Um, so, so olfaction is altered in spontaneous, repeated
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:12:00.340]   spontaneous, uh, pregnancy loss. We don't know this is causal, right? Uh, but, but that was enough
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:08.020]   for us to approach the ethics committee, um, to run a causal experiment. Um, and we're at the beginning of
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:16.740]   that now.
