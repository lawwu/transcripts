[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   What I did was I started in advance of let's go
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.840]   and write down for like two weeks
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.000]   everything I could outsource.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   So similarly, as I was going through anything,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.900]   I just got in my mind, okay, could this go out?
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.120]   Okay, I'm putting a list.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.580]   Once I saw the magnitude of that list,
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.040]   you know, if you think about the cost
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.880]   of hiring virtual assistants,
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.040]   you said it could be anywhere from one to $4,000 a month
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.600]   for a full-time person.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   And there are other options
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.960]   if you want fractional and all that stuff.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.280]   Imagine what you could do with that,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.480]   whether it's spending it just with your family
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760]   or on really big strategic things with your business.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.160]   Maybe you don't have time to buy a small business
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.360]   because you have so much stuff going on
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.400]   in your personal life.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.000]   What if you could outsource a lot of that personal life stuff
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.240]   so that you could go and buy a small business?
