[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540]   In 2021, there was a absolutely crazy deal where if you donated money through
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.060]   Simply Miles to Conservation International, you got a whopping 240
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.580]   American miles per dollar, which effectively brought the price of
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.360]   American miles down to 0.42 cents.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.700]   Which I think mainly by coincidence is the exact same price that they are
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.520]   valued for when you look at Basque Bank earning, but I think that's purely a
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.440]   coincidence. I think it's very easy to make American miles worth at least one
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   cent, if not two cents or more.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.840]   And so I personally know a handful of people who bought millions and millions
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.820]   of miles. I think if you spent $20,000 getting 240 American Airlines points per
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.360]   dollar, you would have ended up with 4.8 million American miles.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.320]   Honestly, I wish I could go back in time and take advantage of this.
