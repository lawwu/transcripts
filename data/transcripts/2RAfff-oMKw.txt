[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420]   Alright, everybody, welcome to Episode 149 of the all in
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.820]   podcast with me again, David Sachs and Chamath Palihapitiya
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.780]   David Freeburg couldn't make it this week, we're going to carry
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.980]   on without him. And it's a difficult week. So just a quick
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.180]   opening statement from me about this episode, like all of you
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.180]   were devastated by the terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.580]   on Saturday. And I just want to start the discussion here with
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.100]   two important housekeeping notes. First, this is obviously
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.540]   a very dynamic situation. And we're dealing with the fog of
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.020]   war quite literally. So we're going to do our best to make
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.340]   sense of what's happening. But things will change between when
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.780]   we tape this episode on Thursday, and you choose to
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.300]   listen to it in all likelihood at some point over the weekend.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.580]   Second, there are going to be some folks out there who claim
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.300]   quite correctly that we are not the experts on this topic. And
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.940]   thus, we shouldn't chime in with our opinions. On the other side,
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.460]   the all in community has told me explicitly, they want to hear us
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.540]   discuss what happened and they want a sense of normalcy. As one
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.340]   loyal listener explained to me last night at a dinner, the fact
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.640]   that the four of you can debate hard topics, listen to each
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.860]   other, and in the end, have a deeper understanding of the
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.620]   world gives me hope every week. That's why I listen. So we'll do
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.060]   what we do here every week. We'll have the hard discussion.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.860]   We'll listen to each other deeply, hopefully. And we'll try
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860]   to understand the world and each other just a little bit more.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.180]   And that's worth it, at least to me and apparently many of you.
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.500]   So with those two quick disclaimers, gentlemen, anything
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.860]   you want to say up front before I recap where we are five days
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.300]   into this senseless brutality.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.460]   I think that was a pretty good intro, Jason. I mean, you're
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.380]   right, we're taping on Thursday, late morning Pacific time, by
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.660]   the time this drops, it'll be Friday. And so a lot could have
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.740]   happened. Also, it's true that the Middle East in general, and
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.020]   this topic in particular is hugely complicated, we will be
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.060]   accused of not being experts. But at the same time, the
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.820]   audience seems to appreciate our opinions as consumers of
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.780]   information who are trying to make sense of the world. Yeah.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.100]   So that's all we can really do.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.500]   Right. And conversations, I think, are how we make progress.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.860]   Any thoughts before we get started here? And I'll recap
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.140]   what's occurred to my any, any opening thoughts before we get
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.020]   into the details here,
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.980]   on behalf of somebody who
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.980]   worked in Israel, have a lot of friends there spent a lot of
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.300]   time there. It's really just a terrible, devastating situation.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.420]   I've really tried to stay off of social media, just because it's
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.620]   allowed me to kind of think a little bit more logically, it's
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.140]   fast and furious right now, I think on x. And it's just a lot
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.340]   of people trying to make sure that their version of the truth
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.500]   is amplified over every other version of the truth, which I
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.940]   think is like a is the point in the cycle where you just have to
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.340]   almost unplug from the matrix a little bit. And find a few
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.860]   places that seem to be just telling things in an even
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.420]   handed way, which I also find on x. And then just kind of
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.300]   reconstruct what happened, why it happened. What do we do from
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.180]   here? I don't know. I don't know. I have a lot of thoughts
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.660]   on a lot of the peripheral issues. But the core issue is
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.500]   just, I'm just stunned that this happened. I don't even know
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.780]   how this is possible that this happened.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.660]   Like Jamath, I'm not trying to get too weighed in too deeply
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.220]   into the tweets. But
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.180]   I did notice you, by the way, have stopped tweeting. You've
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.020]   done a couple of retweets, but you pause this week, a lot of
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.540]   your tweeting.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.100]   Yeah, I mean, I think you're processing time to listen and
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.380]   learn and process what's going on. Right? That's not a great
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.460]   time to be having hot takes. I have posted a few things. First
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.020]   of all, Jason, you've made the analogy to 9/11 being in New
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.580]   York right now. I think that that is the comparison that's
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.860]   been made is that this is Israel's 9/11. I think that's a
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.660]   justifiable comparison in two respects. One is this was a
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.380]   terrorist attack. It was an atrocity. This was a massacre of
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.140]   civilians. Even if you're somebody who believes in the
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.540]   Palestinian cause, you should be able to recognize that these
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.860]   were war crimes. Yeah, the videos are coming out, the
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.900]   stories are coming out. In particular, the rounding up and
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.980]   slaughter of 260 attendees at a music festival was really beyond
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.100]   the pale. They're clearing some of these farming villages and so
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.060]   forth. And finding the bodies, the young families basically
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.220]   killed. Anyway, we don't need to repeat all of the details here.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.500]   But this was, I think, an attack on civilians that is
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.220]   reminiscent of 9/11 and has affected the Israeli people in
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.660]   a similar way. I think the other analogy to 9/11 that's worth
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.340]   discussing is the reaction to this or what Israel's going to
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.100]   do and what the reaction is by US political figures. You heard
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.780]   people like Nikki Haley basically saying to Netanyahu
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.900]   finish them. It wasn't exactly clear whether she was just
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.340]   talking about Hamas or the whole Gaza Strip or maybe Iran. And
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.020]   then if there was any ambiguity about that, you just had Lindsey
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.220]   Graham come out and say level the place, meaning referring to
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.980]   all of Gaza. Yeah, it's crazy. I'm very concerned that one of
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.660]   the purposes here of the terrorists was to provoke an
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.740]   overreaction like the US engaged in after 9/11. Remember, we were
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.900]   viciously attacked, we were wounded. We then lashed out and
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.020]   plunged into two decades of wars in the Middle East. What was the
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.260]   result of that? We lost thousands of lives or own
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.620]   soldiers, we spent trillions of our treasure. Millions of people
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.100]   on the other side died. And at the end of the day, we only
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.340]   changed the geopolitical map of the Middle East in ways that
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.420]   were ultimately unfavorable for us. Iran became a more powerful
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.300]   country. The region became destabilized. And we squandered
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.940]   the sympathy that the United States had and its moral
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.140]   position that we had after 9/11 in the eyes of much of the
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.700]   world. So the US I think, fell for the trap that I think bin
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.740]   Laden laid, which was to provoke us into an overreaction. I think
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.700]   that is one of the goals of terrorists is to create such an
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.980]   outrage, such a provocation that they will bait the other side
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.420]   into an overreaction. I'm quite concerned that could happen
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.820]   here. I think that our US leaders should be, as friends of
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.940]   Israel's should be counseling a cool headed response. I think
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.620]   braying for war with Iran or suggesting that the entire Gaza
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.820]   Strip should be leveled would be doing exactly the wrong thing.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.140]   It would ignite the Arab street.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.220]   And to your point, at least, perhaps that was the goal here.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.300]   And we're trying to figure out what is the goal of this attack
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.860]   that was planned for years. And perhaps that was the goal is to
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.660]   try to take all the hard for peace and progress that has been
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.060]   made in that process over the over the last couple years,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.380]   Abraham Accords, and you know, stability, and then just, you
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.020]   know, really create a full scale escalation.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.620]   I think that's right. I mean, look, I think Israel is within
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.060]   its rights to dismantle and destroy Hamas. Hamas is an
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.860]   organization that in its charter has said they're committed to
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.780]   the destruction of Israel, they've now committed this
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.980]   atrocity. Again, it was, if they had just limited their attack on
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.260]   uniformed Israeli officers and military, I think that would be
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.140]   one thing, but they went much further than that. The vast
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.980]   majority of the casualties here are civilians who were murdered
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.380]   in atrocious ways. So I think there are terrorist organization
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.300]   in Israel as well within its rights to destroy them. However,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.460]   the question is how you do that. Yeah, like, a lot of terrorist
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.300]   organizations, Hamas can kind of melt away into the population
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.980]   of Gaza, they've apparently have these elaborate tunnel networks,
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.020]   they've got bunkers. So it's not clear that you can destroy them
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.220]   from the sky through bombing. Those kinds of bombs would lead
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.980]   to a lot of civilian casualties, which will inflame the situation
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.380]   and turn a world opinion against Israel. At the same time, if
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.100]   they go in with ground forces, that seems like a really tough
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.740]   situation as well, because Hamas is waiting for them, and they
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.340]   will have to fight a guerrilla war in a very tightly packed,
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.700]   dense urban area where Hamas likely has anti tank weapons,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.180]   weapons that we've seen that have been so effective against
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.340]   armored vehicles in Ukraine. Again, if the fighting gets too
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.300]   hot, they can disappear into these tunnel networks, there's
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.860]   going to be IDs everywhere, it's going to be a very, very tough
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.660]   fight for the Israelis. So I think they're in an incredibly
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:57.020]   tough spot. I'm not quite sure what the right reaction is for
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.620]   them. But I do think that if the reaction is this, let's call it
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.100]   the Lindsey Graham level the place reaction, I think that
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.980]   could set off a much wider regional war or even a world
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.020]   war. And that is not something that's ultimately going to help
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.220]   Israel. And I hope that our leaders are wise enough to be
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.180]   counseling against that.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.700]   I get the sense that they're not going to go that hard. And if
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.700]   you look at the American response to 911, you know, going
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.940]   into Afghanistan and dismantling al Qaeda, a noble mission, and
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.500]   we didn't have any more terrorist attacks on America or
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.700]   very, we thwarted most terrorist attacks, there were attempts,
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.820]   actually. And our intelligence was very strong over the last
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.340]   couple of decades. And we haven't had another one of those.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.140]   But you're right going into Iraq. And then, you know, what
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.780]   was the last decade about being in Afghanistan,
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.580]   we went into Iraq, we went into Syria, went into Libya, we
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.900]   stayed in Afghanistan for 20 years, it should have been a
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.020]   quick surgical strike to take out al Qaeda and their Taliban
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.660]   hosts, and then we should have gotten out.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.500]   And even that is incredibly difficult as a mission, as
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.700]   you're pointing out here, you know, Hamas can just fade away
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.740]   into the Gaza Strip, and into into Palestine. And, you know,
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.820]   who knows, Shema, I guess where we're at right now is trying to
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.940]   make sense of why this happened, and what the next couple of
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.620]   weeks might look like, right. And so your thoughts.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.060]   I think Israel has every right to defend itself, and they
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.380]   should eradicate Hamas. This is not like we woke up and found
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.340]   out that they were a terrorist organization yesterday, or on
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.580]   Sunday. We've known this for years, they've been labeled as
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.900]   such. People have been monitoring their money flows for
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.020]   years, we know where they were funded. But the thing to keep in
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.540]   mind is that those 30,000 Hamas terrorists have also been
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.820]   keeping 2.2 Palestinians hostage for the last 20 years. And of
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.660]   the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza, half are kids. And so
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.980]   David's right, the thing to keep in mind is, as barbaric as what
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:10.580]   happened to the Israelis were Israel, in its actions, could
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.500]   cause tremendous civilian casualties, which will just
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.460]   further inflame the ability to find a long term peace in the
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.260]   Middle East. That's really tragic. And that's probably part
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.580]   of Hamas is kind of sadistic calculus, which is they they
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.700]   probably expected this kind of a reaction, and they probably
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.420]   don't care at the end of the day. So it's important to
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.980]   separate Palestinians from Hamas, but I understand and I
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.860]   know where Israel is coming from, because we face the same
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.380]   reaction after 911. The question that I have is, Israel is the
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:52.700]   most sophisticated military and intelligence organization in the
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.340]   world. And the reason is because when everybody talks about
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.420]   priorities, Israel only really has one priority, which is to
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.620]   safeguard the Israeli people survive. And they've been
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.540]   essentially in a conflict zone with this sort of Damocles
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:17.580]   since the founding of Israel. So there are three organizations
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.220]   that really have to figure out what happened here, right?
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.220]   There's Mossad, which is the Foreign Intelligence Service of
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.820]   Israel. There's Shin Bet, which is the domestic security
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.980]   apparatus. And there's a man which is the military
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.420]   intelligence group. And it's like, how did this happen?
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.860]   Because this should have been priority 123 and four, right?
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.740]   And it has always been for them. Other countries, the
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.300]   safeguarding of their people is not necessarily always number
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.020]   one, right? And then things happen. And then you reprioritize
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.860]   it. In many ways, that's what happened in 911. I guess at some
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.700]   level in America.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.460]   I mean, we had all the signal before that. And when we did the
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.340]   911 commission, and we found out they were going to flight
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.980]   school here, you know, and it was pretty clear that it was an
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.060]   intelligence failure for America.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.700]   Those are the two big thoughts that I have, which is there's
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.060]   just going to be so many civilian casualties, what will
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.820]   that do to actually, I think that that has a huge negative
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.180]   impact on the long term chances of peace, because then radicals
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.860]   will use that information to further or to attempt to
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.380]   radicalize the next generation of Palestinians or other Arabs
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.540]   or whatever. And so I worry that the progress that was made in
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.420]   the Abraham Accords, all the normalization goes off the
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.500]   rails. And that's tragic, because most of these people,
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.980]   the overwhelming majority of all people everywhere, they just
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.540]   want peace, they just want to live a peace and life, take care
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.900]   of their family, raise their kids. So that's really tragic.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.660]   But then the other the other part of my mind is like, how
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.420]   could this have fallen through the cracks? And, and why were
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.020]   the most sophisticated intelligence organizations caught
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.820]   flat footed here?
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.500]   Yeah, it is going to be a lot of information that will come out
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.060]   over time and lessons. And by the way, the reason why that
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.020]   second piece is important is not to point the finger at anybody.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.260]   But it's the de escalate because of what sacks it earlier, which
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.620]   is that when people who can articulately gird for war, are
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.500]   given the bully pulpit, and you see American politicians now
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.540]   braying and girding for war. I don't think they fully recognize
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.540]   the consequences of that they're not doing a full accounting of
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.740]   what America has lived through in the last quarter century. And
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.820]   now to induce other countries to try to do the same, I think is
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.140]   so dangerous. And so if we can understand where these cracks
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.940]   are, at least we can de escalate those specific individuals
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.180]   attempts to escalate. And if we don't do that, we're going to
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.020]   find ourselves in a really complicated war. And I don't
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.220]   think anybody wants that nobody wins.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.020]   Nobody wins. Yeah. I mean, at this point, really, the
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.340]   returning of the hostages seems to be the most important, you
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.780]   know, high order mission that has to occur. After that,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.580]   clearly dismantling Hamas and this terror apparatus. But you
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.100]   know, having started to spend some time, you know, in the
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.700]   region and talking to people over there. And again, I'm no
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.020]   expert, but I have been talking to people who've been working on
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.180]   this, you know, got people who've been working on trying to
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.020]   create peace in the region for their entire lives. And this is
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.820]   definitely a setback. But I'm an optimist. And I actually think
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.260]   that in some ways, this is going to create a climate where people
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.460]   are going to really fight to try to resolve the situation, or at
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.100]   least contain the situation, to state solution, the Abraham
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.140]   Accords, and I think they're this is going to renew people's
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.540]   commitment to peace in the region. And I know many, many of
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.540]   the countries over there are really aghast at what happened.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.860]   And they've been working really hard to try to normalize
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.540]   relations there and create peace and prosperity and commerce. And
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.140]   you know, between the different countries in the region. So this
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.420]   is just heartbreaking for the loss of human life, and how that
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   occurred. And then it's also heartbreaking for the peace
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.740]   process and all this progress that's been made recently. And
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.340]   so I think it's, you know, the, there's no silver lining here.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.740]   But I do think this will, maybe the good people of the world
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.220]   will recommit to trying to resolve this issue and create
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.620]   peace in the region. That's my hope. I know it's simplistic.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.060]   And again, no expert, but that's my hope. And I've been spending
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.380]   time over there and learning a lot more about the region. These
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.860]   these are multi generational issues that are going to take
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.380]   generations to figure out. And it's, it's two steps forward,
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.180]   one step back, obviously. But man, for the politicians and the
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.220]   people negotiating this piece, and they work so tirelessly on
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.860]   this for their whole lives. You know, keep at it. I mean, that's
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.740]   all we can do, right?
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.780]   I mean, Jason, I think disrupting the process that was
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.340]   happening towards normalization of relations between Israel and
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.020]   Arab states, specifically the Gulf monarchies, I think was one
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.020]   of the objectives here. Yeah. So I mean, Israel's contention for
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.100]   a long time is they want to negotiate peace, they want to
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.860]   negotiate, but they don't have a partner to negotiate with.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.020]   Whether you believe that or not, that was that was their
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.260]   position. And with the Abraham Accords, we saw that they
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:37.340]   started to be able to negotiate again, normalization with three
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:43.460]   Gulf Arab states, without involving the Palestinians. And
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.820]   it looked like that issue was being put to one side, and that
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.380]   they were kind of going around it. And the idea being, look, if
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.340]   you won't negotiate with us, then we'll figure out a way to
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.140]   move forward without you. The big news that, you know, it's
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.660]   been going on in the last few months is that supposedly
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:04.540]   Israel, and Saudi Arabia were close to working out some sort
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.020]   of normalization. And I think that process has been put on
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.100]   hold until I think this has been dealt with. And so I think one
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.460]   of the takeaways here is the idea that you're going to be
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.900]   able to get to Middle East peace without resolving this
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.020]   Palestinian question. I think this is basically a return to
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.380]   the reality that that issue is simply going to have to be dealt
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.100]   with. I don't think we're going to get to a larger deal in the
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.780]   Middle East, we're not going to resolve all these problems until
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.060]   this long festering problem of the treatment of the
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.020]   Palestinians is is dealt with. I think you're right that the two
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.540]   state solution is the only possible solution that makes
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.300]   sense. I mean, what's the alternative? A one state
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:57.020]   solution means that either it's run by the Israelis, but
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.700]   presiding over hostile Palestinian minority that may
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.700]   eventually one day be the majority and you're forced into
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.580]   some sort of apartheid state, or the Palestinians are running
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.020]   that one party state and it means that the Jews have been
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.220]   pushed into the sea. So neither one of those solutions looks
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.540]   very good. So that leaves you with a two state solution,
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.900]   however hard, however impossible it seems to negotiate that. It's
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.900]   the only option.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.260]   Yeah, it's the only option. And it's a real opportunity. I think
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.820]   the my hope is that instead of pushing Saudi away, this
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.820]   actually pulls Saudi closer and says, Okay, this is a chance to
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.100]   really normalize the global perception of the Middle East.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.100]   Because if there can be a way for Israel and Saudi to build a
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.700]   bridge here, I have a lot of hope that there can be a lot of
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.620]   stability and a lot of the good work. I mean, again, like, man,
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:59.660]   as a democrat who has been left homeless, who is now definitely
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.460]   in the center, but probably leaning increasingly right, I'm
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.220]   left yet again with an appreciation, despite the
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.100]   messenger of the message of the Trump administration, because
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.460]   what those guys did was pretty incredible. In hindsight, these
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.820]   Abraham Accords, the Accords with Israel and the GCC, the
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:25.220]   almost accord between Israel and Saudi. To really be able to
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:31.260]   like, find a long lasting peace is just a real example for the
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.500]   world. And those guys did a lot of really good work. And it's a
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.780]   miracle, actually, when you when you look at it, what they did,
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.660]   you know, despite the fact, listen, I'm no fan of Trump. And
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.460]   I am to a homeless. But if you want to objectively look at what
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.260]   they did, that was hard work. It was you have to, you have to.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.380]   And in fact, this is a moment where you have to start to re
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.020]   underwrite like, is your not your Jason, but I'm just saying
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.060]   collectively is one's Trump derangement syndrome, causing
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.980]   more damage than anything that Trump could have actually done.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.860]   And I think the answer is yes, because like, it's now causing
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:13.500]   us to not see that good work and then embrace and extended so much
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.020]   of the work that happened in that administration. Turns out
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.900]   to have been right. And that's what's so frustrating for me.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.900]   The work on the border wall, we didn't like the messenger. So we
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.740]   killed the message. Turned out it was right. issuing long term
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.620]   debt to refinance when rates were at zero, we didn't like the
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.180]   messenger. So we killed the message. A structural piece in
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.860]   the Middle East, we didn't like the messenger. So we killed the
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.020]   message. When are we going to stop shooting ourselves in the
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.460]   foot? And when are we going to actually see and take the time
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.780]   to look past who is saying things and actually listen to
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.860]   them word for word. I'll give you an example. I started to
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.660]   tweet three links a day over the past three days. And the only
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.340]   reason I did that was I thought things were so hyper contentious
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.260]   and hyper partisan that I just wanted to show a few sides,
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.780]   right. And one day I found a couple links, two of which one
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.620]   was from Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL, who I thought had a
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.220]   very powerful message. And one was from Mike Flynn. And his
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.900]   message was also actually pretty powerful if you just read it.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.500]   And if you took the names off, all the content was so valuable
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.540]   both points of view, but the minute it goes into the world,
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.780]   people immediately judge and they kill the message because of
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.740]   the messenger. And this is exactly a moment where you have
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.100]   an opportunity to just stop doing that because the stakes
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.660]   are so high. It's infuriating, actually, quite honestly, it's
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.220]   infuriating to see it. We had this last week on the show when
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.500]   we were talking about reducing spending, the Mac gates is not
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.940]   the perfect messenger, but his message was the message we've
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.540]   been talking about, which is, hey, we have to control
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.420]   spending. So I can understand people not liking that gets
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.180]   gates, there's a lot of things to not like about I can
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.180]   understand people not liking Trump and get over it. Well, and
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.460]   then you know, it's it's bizarre that his son in law went to do
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.740]   all this work. But yet he did it. And it had success. That's
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.260]   another example. It's weird, if you listen to your son in law to
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.500]   do it, but I listened to the
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.340]   notes. You know what, it's not weird, because at the end, if
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.180]   you listen to this podcast, the most important thing that is
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.060]   resoundingly obvious about Jared Kushner is that he is
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.980]   incredibly thoughtful and incredibly competent. And right,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:40.020]   why did we have to spend years being fed all of these stupid
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.540]   lies? Because one can judge for oneself, but Jared Kushner is
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.580]   thoughtful. He's smart. And I thought to myself, I was fed all
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.020]   these lies for years about how this guy was like, moping around
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.420]   in the shadows and this and that and it was all not true.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:01.340]   Well, no, when I say it's non traditional, if you sent, you
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.780]   know, any president's son in law, daughter in law, whatever
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.100]   child to go to the Middle East, on its surface, this seems
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.740]   insane. But in fact, he they did good work. And so it's not
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.300]   traditional. It's not what you would expect thoughtful and
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.220]   competent. That's what I thought after I that's what I got out of
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.860]   it as well. And so he's thoughtful and competent.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.980]   Yeah, he brought some fresh ideas, just so the audience is
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.940]   clear. What we're talking about is he just did an interview with
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.340]   Lex Friedman. And the first hour was on what's happening with
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.580]   Israel and Hamas must must watch. I think I thought it was
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.300]   excellent. Excellent, excellent. It was excellent. He did it just
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.340]   in terms of having fresh eyes. He did things like focus groups.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.180]   He's like, Okay, what does what does the Arab street think about
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.060]   various topics? And he actually did focus groups in various
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.820]   countries to find out. So I mean, I think Kushner made a
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.100]   number of really interesting points showing how difficult
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.300]   it's going to be to get to a two state solution. But first, you
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.340]   have to set up what is the the Palestinian side say, and what
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.660]   they say is, look, Gaza is effectively an open air prison,
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.740]   you've got over 2 million people packed into this very tight
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.100]   area. There's something like 50% unemployment, it's impoverished,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.940]   the conditions are deplorable. And they don't have their own
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.860]   state, they don't have rights. And it's been like this for a
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.300]   long time. So that's sort of the the basic pro Palestinian
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.180]   argument. Kushner's response that was, well, yeah, but you
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.020]   know, Israel left in 2006, it left Hamas in control, gave them
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.660]   the keys effectively. The reason why there's such high
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.300]   unemployment is because Hamas is corrupt and doesn't enforce
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.620]   property rights. And they scare away all the investment. Nobody
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.140]   wants to invest there. And Israel did give work permits so
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.700]   people could leave Gaza to go to work and look what happened. I
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.580]   mean, when they try to open up the walls, you have a massacre.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.340]   So these are the points that he made. Look, I think both sides
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.740]   of this have legitimate arguments and points to make. I
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.860]   think that the conditions of the Palestinians in Gaza is
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.780]   deplorable. And you have to feel for the civilians who live
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.500]   there, of course, but then, you know, the Israelis have a right
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.060]   to live without fear, the fear that their security is in
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.420]   jeopardy, and that this territory can be the launching
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.300]   pad for terrorist attacks on their soil. So it's going to be
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.460]   an extremely difficult thing, I think, to to reconcile this, but
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.220]   you know, Kushner made a couple other interesting points. He
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.180]   said, Listen, the Gaza part of this is not that hard, because
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.940]   the boundaries, the territory lines are not in dispute.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.860]   There's no religious areas that are in dispute. For example,
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.020]   you don't have the status of the Temple Mount or, you know, East
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.260]   Jerusalem, and there's an economic plan to revitalize Gaza
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.780]   strip. So you really just need a negotiating partner for the
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.020]   Israelis to figure that out. And of course, now the problem is,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.300]   who do you negotiate with? I mean, Hamas is is a terrorist
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.180]   organization that is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. So
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.420]   it's really a tragic situation, you look at it, and you're like,
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.620]   this should be easy to work out, but it's not.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.620]   It's a relatively small area. It's a relatively small number
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.340]   of people. It's 2 million people, we should be able to
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.660]   figure out the rest of the free world, how to at least have a
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.980]   path towards this. And the first step is getting rid of Hamas,
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.220]   right? Like, there's no choice, but they have to go.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.540]   I don't really know if that's feasible, Jason. I mean, look,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.700]   if there was a button that Israel could push to eliminate
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.020]   every member of Hamas, yeah, sure, they'd be within the
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:32.340]   rights to push that the problem is that Hamas is now deeply
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.340]   integrated, yeah, embedded in a civilian population of over 2
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.060]   million, that's densely packed, how do you root them out?
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.140]   It's going to take decades, it's going to take decades.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.220]   And they're basically supported by that population, as far as we
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.500]   can tell. Yeah. And, you know, again, if you if you take
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.220]   measures that are perceived as too drastic by the rest of the
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.660]   world, then you will inflame the opinion of other countries,
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:01.420]   you'll turn it against Israel. So, again, it's a really tough
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:06.700]   situation. But I think that the US should not only affirm its
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.980]   support for Israel, it should only denounce the atrocity that
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.300]   happened on 10.7. But I think it needs to reiterate the Biden
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.700]   administration does its support for a two state solution. I
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.500]   think that the US has to be on record that what's in everybody's
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.100]   long term interest, including Israel is ultimately a two state
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.980]   solution. And the Palestinians are eventually gonna have to
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.740]   have their own state. There's simply no way around that.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:36.660]   Right? Yeah. And the free world, I think, is in the process
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.140]   of getting engaged in making this happen, because it's in
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.300]   everybody's interest, this can't keep going on. And so hopefully
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.660]   this, again, I don't want to say silver lining, but I hope that
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.420]   this, the good that comes out of this is that the world focuses
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.380]   on resolving this conflict, or
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.300]   containing a prize that all Jason by the amount of people
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.340]   that seem to be almost justifying
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.260]   that was happening to me. I mean, the fact that people could
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.900]   make any kind of equivalence between terrorist activity and
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.420]   the level of brutality, I can't even describe it, because it'll
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.860]   trigger my PTSD, which I had after 911. And it still affects
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.620]   me, I'm sitting here not far from ground zero. And, you know,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.820]   for people, you know, educated people, on colleges, campuses,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:30.340]   or just otherwise to blame the Israelis for the murder of
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.820]   children, for people being and then justifying rape and
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.900]   torture, kidnapping. I mean, there is no justification and
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.940]   there's no equivalency. There's no equivalency here. And this is
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.140]   one of the big problems. And, you know, these dopey kids on
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.900]   Harvard's campus or whatever, they have never experienced
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:53.340]   evil, stance suffering. We can we literally just dismiss these
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.380]   idiots, because these are kids who have never faced I don't
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.940]   think you can, I think one of the things that was shocking to
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:06.140]   me was the level of basically either subtle or latent
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.180]   anti semitism, unconscious, yes, subtle, whatever, that it
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.980]   unlocked. And I was also shocked at just saxes use this word
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.700]   before, but it's true. But our leading educational institutions
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.860]   have really become woke madrasas. They are inculcating
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.100]   kids with just some virulent poison. I think the reaction is
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.380]   always to go after to support the underdog. I think in this
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.820]   group of people, what is that even receive that is that is a
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.340]   gas that is an idiotic simplification that the smartest
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.940]   schools in the world educating the smartest kids in the world
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.980]   should be that's how they think. That's how they think that can't
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.260]   be that's my feeling. I can't be that there's, it's half
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.900]   anti semitism. It's half they just think who's the underdog?
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   I'm taking that side.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.180]   Yeah, I think it's that simple. It is in the woke mindset. Yeah.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.260]   Well, look, I think it was disgusting and disturbing to see
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.940]   these organizations and these elite institutions being unable
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.940]   to denounce Hamas terrorist attack and the atrocity that
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.420]   took place, or turning out in the streets to celebrate what
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.020]   happened. And we saw a lot of that to look even if you support
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.180]   the Palestinian cause, even if you believe that they've been
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.140]   mistreated, even if you think that their land has been
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:26.180]   occupied, they deserve their own state. Even if you believe that
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.380]   war against the State of Israel is justified on that basis.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.580]   These were still war crimes. These were beyond the pale of
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.620]   war. Again, Hamas did not just attack some military
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.740]   installations on the border and kill soldiers or capture
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.860]   soldiers, the vast majority of the people who were killed were
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.460]   civilians, and there was no conceivable military purpose. And
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.380]   for example, paragliding into a music festival, a festival for
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.100]   peace, by the way, and then rounding up and slaughtering the
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.700]   concert goers. There was no conceivable military
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.860]   justification for going into these kibbutzes or farming
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.500]   communities.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.220]   You know, families,
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.780]   not arranged,
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.100]   it's deranged, so
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.540]   strange. It's terrorism. And the fact that they can't frame it
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.220]   as terrorism is insane. But think about what happened. Okay, I
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.420]   just want to frame the order of events. Okay. 10 seven happens.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.420]   And I think within 36 hours or less, let's take Harvard as an
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.540]   example, okay, the the pinnacle of the woke madrasas, they had
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.340]   all these student organizations immediately come out trying to
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.780]   justify this thing without any information, right? Because in
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.260]   the first 36 hours, obviously not nearly as much information
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.420]   was available as to exactly what happened. Then it's been
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.980]   available now as an example,
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.660]   I should read the statement just so people have clarity, please
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.980]   join us joint statement by Harvard, Palestine, Palestine
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.940]   solidarity groups on the situation in Palestine. We the
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.500]   undersigned student organizations hold Israeli the
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.980]   Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.660]   violence. Today's events did not occur in a vacuum. The last two
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.820]   decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.380]   forced to live in an open air prison. Israeli officials
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.020]   promised to quote open the gates of hell and the massacres in
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.540]   Gaza have already commenced Palestine, Palestinians in Gaza
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.820]   have no shelters or for refuge, and nowhere to escape in the
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.620]   coming days, Palestine, Palestinians will be forced to
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:29.100]   bear the full brunt of Israel's violence. This is deranged. So
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:29.820]   show pathic
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.580]   my point is you thought you have like 15 or 20 of these student
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.780]   organizations of all ilks, okay, so it's not just pro Palestinian
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.940]   groups. It was like the Harvard Sikhs Association, okay, like
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.820]   Sikhs in South Asia are the most peace loving people in the
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.700]   world. They're not pro war of any kind whatsoever or pro
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.540]   terrorism. So all these people write this thing, which blames
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.700]   Israel, okay, then the school is totally silent. The school
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.380]   doesn't say they neither they neither completely disavow that
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.500]   statement, nor do they come out with a more reasonable statement.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.100]   All these ex faculty and ex individuals, Larry Summers, sort
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.300]   of leading say, this is outrageous, have an opinion,
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.900]   they come out with something that's milk toast in middle of
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.300]   the road, then they get soundly rejected by everybody yet again,
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.420]   then the administration comes out and gives a cleaned up
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.500]   version that tries to allay everybody's anger, because that
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.220]   the first statement, I think basically essentially pissed off
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.420]   everybody on both sides. Then a bunch of alums who've already
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.980]   graduated or who've given money say, these student organizations
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:41.140]   are outrageous, we will not hire anybody who's part of this
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.140]   because their views are so immoral, that we would never
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.820]   want these people part of our organization.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.700]   And so here it is, Bill Ackman, just so we people have yes, Bill
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.380]   Ackman said, I have been asked by a number of CEOs of Harvard
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.460]   will release a list of the members of each of the Harvard
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.540]   organizations that have issued the letter assigning sole
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.540]   responsibility for a massive heinous acts to Israel. So as to
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.340]   ensure that none of us inadvertently hire any of their
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.020]   members. In other words, you must own your words, which is
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.300]   okay. So then for so then what happens is individual students
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.220]   actually have to come out who are part of these associations
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.580]   that were signatories to the first release, had to disavow
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.180]   the statement, and said, Actually, I'm just an Indian
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.660]   student at Harvard Law School. There's a Nick, maybe you can
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.740]   find this tweet of this like, Indian woman from Colorado or
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.100]   of Indian heritage. And she's like, you just get auto
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.660]   recruited into these organizations. When you join
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.660]   Harvard. So I'm like, Well, wait a minute. This is a place
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.820]   that's supposed to be for like modern free speech, progressive
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.060]   thinking. And instead, what happens is based on your skin
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.740]   color, you get auto drafted into some association, then you auto
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.660]   sign any press release written by some person that you don't
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.060]   even see or approve. What is going on at these places. And
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.740]   these are the places that parents and kids are tripping
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.940]   over themselves, trying to get into kids will kill themselves
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.980]   if they don't get into. And these are the worst
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.660]   institutions in America, because back to Jason, what we
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.300]   talked about earlier, which is, we need people who can think
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.020]   from first principles, those kids are not it. And those
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.900]   institutions are not making them. And so if we want to have
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.980]   a point in time, where when things like this happen, we can
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.620]   really figure out what happened in the past that was right. And
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.140]   what can we do in the future? It's not this. And it's not this
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.260]   kind of thinking. And if you're going to a school, Harvard,
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:37.900]   Cornell, UPenn, Stanford, that are spitting out these kids, I
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.700]   think it's a real shame.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.220]   You're spot on. I mean, how sacks Could there any be any
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:48.500]   question about the difference between military terrorists, you
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.900]   know, with machine guns, gunning down people dancing peacefully
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.540]   at a music festival at sunrise, and then make some equivalency
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.220]   there it and you cannot actually ascertain for yourself that is
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.860]   a terrorist act. If you can't from very basically opening your
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.900]   eyes and seeing what occurred and you know, thank God in some
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.820]   ways for for x not being censored, because you can
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.900]   actually see these things. And I know it's very difficult for
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.660]   people to watch. I don't have any judgment on people who don't
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.620]   want to watch it. But I think when the world sees these
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.820]   videos, and you're going to write this letter, you should
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:30.740]   very quickly be able to discern military terrorist fighters
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.900]   from hippie kids dancing at a music festival. It's plain as
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.660]   day there's there's nothing. There's nothing to confuse you
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:44.100]   here. This is the most easy test. You have to be brainwashed
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.060]   to see something other than that. These schools are woke
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:47.780]   madrasas.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.620]   Yeah, so a couple of points on that. So if you look at their
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.740]   statement, I think it's it's appropriate and fine to express
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.580]   concern about the people the civilians living in Gaza and
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:04.780]   what the Israeli response might entail. I think it is fine and
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.260]   good to do that both for humanitarian reasons and for
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.540]   self interested reasons if you're a supporter of Israel,
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.340]   because this could all spiral out of control. However, these
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.620]   people completely lit their credibility on fire from the
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:22.220]   first paragraph, by saying that Israel is entirely responsible
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.780]   for what happened and not having one word of condemnation for the
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.700]   atrocities that had just been committed. They cannot even see
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.820]   the war crimes that have occurred.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.180]   Yeah, so I don't even mention Hamas. They don't even mention
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.620]   the actual people that perpetrated the crime. Right. So
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.940]   the question is, what is it about their ideology that blinds
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:49.340]   them to this atrocious massacre? And, and I think it is this, I
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.940]   do think it has to do with this this woke mindset. The, the woke
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:58.220]   ideology is a form of cultural Marxism in which people are
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.660]   divided up into oppressor and oppressed groups. So in Marx's
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.540]   original teaching, you had the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.300]   basically the oppressed and the oppressor. This kind of went
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.500]   through this cultural identity filter with woke where again,
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.740]   people are divided up into identity groups. And so you've
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:20.100]   got men versus women, white versus black and brown, you've
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:25.140]   got straight versus gay, and so on down the line. And the the
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.580]   idea is that there's a power structure. And if you are in one
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.020]   of these groups, and you are by definition, oppressed, and if
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:38.100]   you're in one of the oppressor groups, then by definition, you
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.260]   are guilty in a collective way, you're suffering from yes,
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.300]   collective guilt,
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.860]   the people who are oppressed are the righteous ones.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.580]   Right. But I think that what you see is that when you divide up
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.020]   the world this way, first of all, it's just not a very
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.860]   accurate way of looking at the world. I mean, there are lots of
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.780]   minority groups in the United States that have done great. So
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.220]   for example, there's a book written recently about Asian
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.220]   Americans, the United States called the inconvenient
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.700]   minority. Why is it inconvenient? Because Asian
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.260]   Americans have done spectacularly well, they get
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.260]   into elite colleges and institutions at higher rates
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.660]   than than whites do, which is why they're the primary group
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.740]   that's discriminated against by affirmative action before it was
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.820]   overturned by the Supreme Court. But the reason why the author
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.580]   called them the inconvenient minority is because their
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.260]   success in America refutes a lot of this sort of simplistic woke
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.100]   delineation between if you're a minority group, you're oppressed.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.100]   And if you're, you know, in this white group, you're the
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:42.620]   oppressor. I think Jews have fallen into a similar type of
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.100]   categorization, which is they're an inconvenient minority.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.580]   They've been historically very successful in America, despite
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.660]   their being existence of anti semitism. And I think that the
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.460]   woke ideology has reacted to this by saying, No, you know,
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.660]   Jews are not really an ethnic group, they're just whites. And
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.340]   so that's been the response, right is, well, let's just put
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.940]   them in the oppressor group. So we don't need to explain away
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.460]   their success. One of the problems with that is that you
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.820]   have to ignore the existence of anti semitism. And so they do,
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.900]   they just pretend like it doesn't exist. So here you have
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.300]   a situation where all of these things are in play. They've
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.820]   already predefined the Palestinians as being an
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.100]   oppressed people. And look, and I think in many ways, they are,
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.940]   but they are not incorrect. But they've defined it in racial
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.300]   terms, really, right. And they've defined the Israelis and
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.260]   Jews really, more generally as being part of an oppressor
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.420]   group. And so everything fits into that larger narrative. And
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:46.380]   so when members of one of these woke oppressed groups commits
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.300]   an injustice, they just can't see it. I mean, their version of
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.580]   social justice is always defined in terms of collective guilt.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.860]   And if you're a member of an oppressed group, by definition,
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.180]   you're not capable of committing an injustice because you don't
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:00.820]   have the power.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.100]   Do you guys think that Bill Ackman was out of line by
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:09.580]   saying, I don't want to hire kids from these organizations
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.140]   and these schools, because it's just like these kids and these
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.140]   schools will bring, basically, I think what he's implicitly
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.140]   saying is distraction, and it will lower the probability that
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.420]   I achieved by corporate goals. So these are not good workers
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.700]   based on your comment about thinking from first principles
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.700]   and, you know, being able to assess the situation. I think
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.140]   that's probably what happens at a hedge fund, you have to place
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.940]   bets, and you have to be able to think from first principles and
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:38.220]   be intellectually rigorous. This is the most intellectually lazy
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.500]   approach. I'm just going to sign a piece of paper without even
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.980]   thinking. So no, I don't think he's out of line. I think it's
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.340]   an important lesson for people. Freedom of speech. I was owning
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.420]   your words, you must own your words in position. And it's
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.820]   important that young people learn this. Now, you have to own
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.260]   your words, whether it's on social media, or signing some
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.660]   stupid petition that you didn't read. And there's a lot of
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.420]   backtracking going on right now, by the way,
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.780]   I can't believe that if I got into Harvard, I would get
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.180]   auto drafted into the brown men's association just because
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.700]   of the color of my skin. That's gonna be in the factory I've
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.140]   ever heard.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.580]   Gree group. I mean,
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.580]   let's point out the double standard here that these elite
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.580]   Harvard students want to be exempt from their their words,
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.020]   their statements, they don't want to be canceled for that.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.780]   However, you know that when some hapless schmuck basically post
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.180]   some tweet, or posted a tweet 10 years ago, that gets
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.740]   resurfaced. They're the first ones clamoring for their
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.140]   cancellation. Right? Yeah, they would like for their firing.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.340]   They would like amnesty for their idiotic opinions. Yeah,
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.940]   well, it's good. Good for the goose here is good for the
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:45.300]   gander if they're gonna create a cancel culture, where people
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.860]   get canceled for their decade old tweets and so forth, and
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.260]   they should be prepared to live by that standard. Now look,
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.860]   personally, I would have some degree of forgiveness for a
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.500]   college student being part of an organization that puts out a
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   statement, they're claiming they didn't know, okay, but then why
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.900]   didn't you resign? Look, I don't think there's a good excuse for
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.780]   this, other than useful stupidity. So I wouldn't cancel
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.620]   them forever. But look, I do think that it's fine for
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.300]   inappropriate for someone like Bill Atkins. I don't want to
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.060]   hire you people.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.500]   Yeah, and I would just be careful for you to add the word
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.340]   youthful because I think it's as get out of jail free card. It's
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.980]   definitely stupidity. The question is, is the cake baked?
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.420]   And if the cake is baked, then there's a big argument to never
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.580]   hiring these people. I mean, look, I just say your frontal
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.420]   lobes are still developing into your 25 years old. So I would
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.180]   give college kids a bit of a pass if they do stupid stuff.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.500]   You're there to learn you're there to make mistakes. But
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.860]   that's not what I'm saying. Huge mistake. You're saying the
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.900]   bakes fully baked. You mean like their, their opinions and who
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.780]   they are, what I'm saying is you learn a lot from actions drink
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.380]   too much, don't drink, don't exercise enough, you get a
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.700]   little sluggish, maybe a little overweight, I get all of that.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:59.580]   I'm not convinced that when you have this fundamentally specific
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.180]   way of thinking, that you can unwind that so easily, Jason.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.900]   So I'm not convinced. Okay, sure, that this mind virus gets
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.420]   fixed, because you all of a sudden need a job, I actually
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.180]   think like maybe it's the struggle of realizing that there
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.780]   are deep consequences to this vein of thinking that this
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.340]   oppressed versus oppressor or the other way that it was framed
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.100]   in our group chat is that woke ism and the embracement of
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.860]   socialism is basically running away from excellence. It's this
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.940]   idea that everybody has to be the same, what communism says,
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.620]   we all are the same, nobody is special. We're all going to work
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.180]   together, do the same things, we're all going to dress in the
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.260]   same ways. It's the collective we, there aren't going to be
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.140]   exceptional outliers. But the problem is, that's not how the
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:49.500]   world works. And so the other part of why these woke madrasas
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.380]   are so terrible is that it teaches, I think, to work away
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.500]   from excellence, and instead of striving for excellence to strive
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.220]   to be part of a collective. And I think that that is
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.700]   fundamentally corrosive to America, it's corrosive to what
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.180]   God is here, that's corrosive to all the great countries in the
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:09.780]   world. And so then again, it's like, why would you hire kids
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.140]   who fundamentally don't want to be excellent, who are afraid
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.020]   that if they were excellent, they would be guilty of
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.780]   something? That's ultimately the question. Why, why would any of
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.900]   these kids go to such an elite school to basically be taught
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.820]   that it's wrong to excel?
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.460]   All right, well, let's say I think, perhaps a good
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.340]   segment as a result, not think for yourself. And then as a
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.860]   result, sign something like this, which is just stupid.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.220]   We'll continue to discuss this topic, I guess, in the weeks
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.740]   ahead. Again, hopefully this conversation was productive for
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.500]   the community, the all in community. I understand that,
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.140]   you know, people might have very strong feelings about, you know,
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.260]   us discussing it, but we're here to discuss difficult topics.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.060]   There's one other aspect to this, I think we should talk
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.900]   about, which is the United States is larger geopolitical
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.380]   situation right now. I mean, things seem very tenuous. I did
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.500]   an event with Palmer lucky, actually, from the front of the
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:11.180]   pod, Thomas. And my invite got lost. Yeah, we actually had a
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:15.540]   nice debate slash discussion on on Ukraine. But the thing that I
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.420]   think we agree with is that the US better bring more innovation
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.940]   into the military, military industrial complex and, and
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.540]   figure out, like procurement, because our whole cost plus
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.420]   system right now is so broken. There was an article recently in
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.060]   the New York Times where it said that the cost of the United
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.260]   States of producing an artillery shell is $6,000. For
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:41.380]   Russia, it's $600. So in other words, it costs the US 10 times
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.140]   what it costs Russia to produce an artillery shell, even though
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.140]   Russia is considered to be this super corrupt kleptocracy, where
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.500]   everyone steals everything. And yet our procurement system is
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.140]   10 times more efficient than they don't have competition. And
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.100]   all the politicians are captured, correct. We have this
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.100]   cost plus accounting system where every year the price
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.980]   opportunity to explain that. Yeah. So in every other part of
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.340]   technology, price goes down over time, right? You can produce
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:12.820]   more of something for less. We've seen this with Tesla, we
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.860]   seen it with PCs, we've seen it with television sets, whatever
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.620]   it is, the price goes down over time servers. Yeah. Or if the
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.780]   price goes up, it's because you've developed some
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.380]   fundamentally new capabilities, some new version, you know, the
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.700]   more powerful chips, your storage, actually, faster speed,
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.100]   but you know, we're still making the same artillery shells, the
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.300]   same Stinger missiles, the same javelins and so forth. I don't
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.820]   think the capabilities have changed that much. But the price
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:43.140]   goes up every year, because it's cost plus. And so explain cost
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.620]   plus, people may be hearing that for the first, you know, most
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.940]   companies sell something, and then they have a profit margin.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.380]   But right, the way that government procurement works is
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.260]   the profit margin is controlled. They're only allowed
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.540]   to market up a certain amount above their costs. But the thing
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.900]   that's happened in the defense industry is there's been huge
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.900]   consolidation over the past couple of decades, where now
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.340]   you've got a handful of defense companies, and it's an oligopoly.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:12.180]   And many of these key armaments are single source. So there's
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.620]   only one producer, and they just keep raising the price every
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.700]   year. Now, one of the kind of crazy things about this is, and
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.620]   Palmer made this point is, it's not like anyone's getting rich
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.980]   because of cost plus, it's not like the money is basically
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.220]   making these companies
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.180]   there's no incentive to lower the price. If you lower the
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:34.900]   price, and you're a 10%, and you got your $6,000 down to 4000 10%
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.940]   of 4000 is a lot less than 10% of 6000. What's happening is not
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.380]   perverse incentive, Google like margins, what's happening is
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.220]   that these companies keep building their bureaucracies
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.700]   bigger and bigger. So they hire lots of staff, they make a lot
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.420]   of campaign contributions, they fund think tanks. And so their
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.700]   cost structure just keeps getting more and more bloated,
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:54.980]   right?
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.460]   They're incentivized to do that. The more they charge, the more
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:57.860]   they make.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.380]   Right now, why am I bringing this up? Well, we're in a
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:05.900]   situation now where Israel might be on the precipice of well,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.140]   they've declared war against Gaza, and this thing could spiral
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.380]   out of control and become a regional war.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.420]   They may be asking for weapons in
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.700]   they may be asking for weapons, we've already donated some
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.460]   however, earlier this year, we used to have an ammunition
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.980]   stockpile in Israel. The United States did it belong to us, but
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.020]   it was there potentially in case of a problem in the region. And
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:33.020]   that artillery stockpile was basically taken and given to
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.820]   Ukraine. And remember, we ran out of the key type of
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.620]   ammunition in the Ukraine war, which is 155 millimeter
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:44.140]   artillery shells. That's why we gave them cluster bombs. So the
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:49.380]   US is already dangerously low on ammunition. And that's before we
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:55.260]   get potentially another war, or another front in this larger,
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.220]   global conflagration that's happening in other countries
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.300]   war. And to be clear, we're not at war, but we've been right
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.340]   asked to donate weapons to Ukraine. And we've been asked to
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.460]   do that. I think Israelis have asked for weapons. I don't know
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.860]   if they formally asked, but we are obviously going to
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.860]   I think there's a bill making its way through right now. It's
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.100]   going to give some aid to military assistance to Israel.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.860]   By the way, we have
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.100]   Israel also is a major builder of weapons to I mean, their
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.420]   drone technology is incredibly refined, and they sell weapons
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:25.940]   to Russia.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:30.220]   Oh, yeah, Israel is nowhere near the Ukraine situation. Ukraine
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.780]   is 100% dependent on the United States for its military and for
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.860]   its economy. Israel has a vibrant military and economy
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:41.100]   without the United States, but the United States does make
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.780]   long term security guarantees to Israel not to fight its wars.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.700]   There's no mutual defense treaty. However, we do agree to
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:53.220]   provide them with weapons in the event of a war. So we do have
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.300]   obligations like long standing obligations to them. This is an
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.940]   ally we've had for 75 years. However, our stockpiles are
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.380]   dangerously depleted now, because of the Ukraine war. And
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:09.140]   on top of that, our procurement system is hopelessly broken. So
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.820]   in a world of rising multi polarity, where there are other
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.100]   great powers now, in the system where there are going to be more
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.980]   and more global threats, I don't think we have a chance of
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:25.700]   maintaining our global position and supporting our allies unless
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:29.140]   we fix this. I mean, making artillery shells at 10 times
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.660]   more than what it costs Russia. That's ridiculous.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.860]   In Silicon Valley, we have now the funding of military
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.060]   startups, and there's a whole new class of warfare,
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.260]   supersonics, drones,
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.980]   innovation is the only advantage we have. It's the only advantage
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.900]   we have, right. I mean, this is one of the great things. I
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.860]   mean, I understand Palmer is not a huge fan of mine, but I'm a
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.900]   huge fan of the work he's doing and other entrepreneurs are
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.660]   doing to make new weapons to keep us competitive, because you
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.660]   can be sure China's making them. And so I think it's absolutely
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.420]   fantastic. I thought it was always very weird that Google
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:05.500]   speaking of work madrasas like Google was for Google employees
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.740]   were refusing to provide services like even basic cloud
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.540]   hosting services to the military. That that to benefit
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.940]   from democracy and living in America while then not
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.180]   supporting the military just seemed like the ultimate luxury
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:27.340]   belief to use Rob's term from the all in summit mafia thoughts.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:32.380]   What does it take guys to for this fever to break for for all
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:36.860]   of these people to realize that that level of corruption is not
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:41.060]   sustainable, that these ways of thinking are not sustainable,
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.900]   that it's not a path to peace and prosperity that we actually
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.860]   want excellence in society, we want people to be outliers. We
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.700]   want the whole of humanity to move forward. And that's not
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.140]   going to happen when we move, necessarily as one blob, but a
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.900]   few people need to sort of clear the brush and lead the way and
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.140]   the rest of us will come in and fill it in behind them.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.940]   I think Vivek is the manifestation of it. I'll be
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.660]   totally honest, like I think the reason he is going up in the
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.100]   polls, and the reason people are drawn to him is because he's
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:13.340]   smart, and he's exceptional. And he represents one of the great
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.580]   things about America is that there's people who want to win
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.980]   and they're smart and excellent. He represents excellence,
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.540]   right? He represents. I think that's why people are drawn to
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.820]   him. And I think people are tired of an industrial complex,
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.500]   they're tired of corruption, they're tired of geriatric, you
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.820]   know, 80 year old politicians, we need young, successful people
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:33.860]   to take leadership positions.
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.980]   And by the way, I really agree with what you're saying. I think
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.780]   that there's like, excellence can show itself in different
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.180]   forms. I think why Obama was so profound. And Joe Rogan said
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.620]   this was, he was such a statesman, he was the best of us.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.660]   But he demonstrated excellence in being composed and measured
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.660]   and thoughtful and strategic. He was just so excellent.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.300]   The Clinton as well.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:03.980]   Clinton as well. Clinton was incredibly steeped in policy. He
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.180]   was excellent. He was intellectually a massive
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.620]   outlier. Obama is an intellectual outlier. Vivek is
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.380]   an intellectual outlier. Let's get these people to change and
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.260]   run our system of government, please. I think we're soaking in
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:20.380]   it.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.940]   Yeah, we need smarter, more capable people. I mean, you look
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.860]   at Biden, he when he gave that speech, in support of Israel, I
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.860]   mean, a lot of the words were right, but he was like slurring
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.620]   his way through it. It certainly did not inspire confidence.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.780]   It was it was his best speech. And it was concerning the fact
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.420]   that he's clearly in cognitive decline, you can see it in his
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.340]   ability to or it and you know, it was his best speech. And it
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.180]   was also troubling for me as somebody who voted for him to
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.900]   watch him slur his words are just not it was clear he wasn't
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.820]   all there. And you're like, geez, what are we showing to the
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.260]   world if this is the guy who's running the country and if we
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:56.980]   reelect him? Now we're saying, hey, we want to have an 84 year
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.220]   old running the country who's not all there and is in
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.620]   cognitive decline. Let the guy retire. Let him spend time with
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.060]   his grandkids.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:07.020]   I think it's more people who are willing to vote for not for what
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.900]   they want, but to prevent something else. And I think that
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.620]   that's, that's what's so tragic about how we're thinking as a
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.340]   country right now.
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.500]   Yeah, just just to dish it out equally. I mean, I saw Trump
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.060]   give a recent speech where look, he's nowhere near the cognitive
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.940]   decline of Biden. I think he's still compass mentis, but he's
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.180]   not as sharp as he used to be either. I mean, listen, I think
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.540]   America's basic situation and this has really been reaffirmed
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.980]   over the past week is that we're no longer in unipolarity
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.060]   anymore. We're no longer the sole superpower. Yeah, not for
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.660]   some time. China is now a superpower. They're probably the
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.500]   low cost manufacturer of the world. So when we talk about
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.900]   being able to make things like armaments and artillery shells
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.020]   and weapons, they have the ability to outproduce us. That
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.100]   is very scary. There are other great powers in the system. Now
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.300]   Russia has proven over the last five months through his victory
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.340]   and this counter offensive, that is a power to be reckoned with.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:03.700]   We cannot disregard their concerns anymore. And not only
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.740]   does America need, I think, top flight leaders like
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:11.580]   intellectually who are at the top of their game. But we also
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.780]   need new thinking, we need to be able to sidestep challenges and
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.340]   conflicts as opposed to walking into every single trap the way
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:21.620]   that Lindsey Graham wants us to. Again, I'll go back on the
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.660]   Ukraine war. I think it's really clear that we could have avoided
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.660]   that war if we had taken NATO expansion off the table. And
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.020]   whether you believe that or not, it was criminal not to try.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:35.300]   If it was a 5% chance it was worth trying. So you and I
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:39.180]   look at our situation, we're already mired in the Ukraine
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:43.940]   proxy war. Now Israel's on the brink. We need smarter people
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.220]   and smarter thinking in Washington, we are no longer the
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:49.100]   only superpower, we're gonna have a really tough time in a
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.740]   multipolar world. If we do not look for ways to de escalate
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.420]   conflict when we can,
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:59.980]   or putting aside conflict, why are we not building deep ties
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.380]   with as many countries as possible? deep cultural ties,
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.620]   deep economic ties, deep diplomatic ties. Every time we
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.100]   are in dialogue with a country, and we're building a
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.220]   relationship with that country, that means free people of the
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:17.100]   world are winning, you know, and every time we isolate a country
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.660]   that does not go right, we're sanctioning half the world.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.100]   That's another big part of this problem. Yeah. And so you know,
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.940]   it's the normalization of relationships, and the deepening
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:29.020]   of relationships, that is the high order bit and you need
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.420]   somebody in office who can do that. And you know, if you look
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.700]   at how the you know, the hawks in the GOP or the hawks in the
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:39.340]   Democratic Party think they think that we have to be at war
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.740]   with everybody. They think we have to isolate everybody. You
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:45.220]   know, the fact that Trump went, and that famous moment where he
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:49.420]   walked over the in the DMZ in North Korea and was talking to
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:54.900]   Kim Jong Un, that moment you see on Kim Jong Un's face, we can
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.940]   put it in here. He is so happy to be recognized. Now listen, I
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:58.380]   understand.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.740]   He has like, suffering. He has a shocked look on his face. Like I
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:02.980]   can't believe this is happening.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.500]   Right. The same way he did when Dennis Rodman came over.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.060]   No, it's like, it's like a fan meeting Taylor Swift. If you
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.180]   look at those videos, and you compare it to this, it's the
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.540]   same. And culture is our export. And I know this
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.460]   sounds about Jason is simplistic.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.220]   Yes.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.340]   I'll be it can't all be hard power because other countries
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.500]   have it too now. So we have to work on our soft power, but
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.820]   you're not going to enhance American soft power with all
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.140]   this belligerent rhetoric, really this omnidirectional
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:31.900]   belligerence that's coming out of Washington. And this is why I
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.860]   think the smart thing for Blinken to do, or the Biden
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.620]   administration is, yes, you reaffirm that you stand with
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.900]   Israel in the face of this unspeakable atrocity, at the
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.940]   same time, and you don't have to do this right now, because it is
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.220]   a little bit tough to do it right now. But
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.300]   it's 100 hostage.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:51.180]   You have to reaffirm your support for the two state
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.780]   solution. I think the United States has always supported
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.300]   and by the way, I think I think Tony's done a really good job.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.380]   But again, at the end of the day, Tony works for President
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.260]   Biden. And it's like, Biden hasn't been nearly as definitive
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.940]   as he could have been, and Tony's had to clean it up. So
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.500]   one example of this is like in the Wall Street Journal, they
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.540]   immediately on Sunday, that was sure went to blaming Iran,
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:18.500]   right. And then both the Israeli military intelligence and
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.740]   American intelligence, they had to do an entire press circuit to
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.700]   try to disarm this in a way that was not seen in a long time.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:29.540]   And you have to ask yourself, why, why is that even happening?
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.580]   And it's like, well, whatever special interests wanted to get
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.860]   that on the front page of the Wall Street Journal was able to
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.580]   do it. But it has dangerous implications. And then what you
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.100]   need is a really strong leader that can step up and say, this
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.420]   is false, this is not happening. This is what we need. You needed
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.940]   an Obama in that situation. And I think that this is Clinton,
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:53.980]   or Clinton, Reagan. And I think that this is an opportunity for
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:59.180]   us to ask ourselves, okay, who is the most dynamic, excellent
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.140]   candidate that can give us this and be open minded and not make
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.340]   this line about Republican versus Democrat right now,
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.580]   because the world is getting super complicated. We need
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:15.100]   someone hyper, hyper, excellent and intellectually competent.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:21.140]   Well, I will say this for Trump is that he's the only president
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.980]   in recent memory who didn't give us any new wars. Best quality.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.620]   Yeah, I think he has a despite despite all of his issues. I
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.060]   think he has a unique ability to project strength to the American
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.820]   public. While not being one of these super hawks. He's
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.380]   actually, I'd say relatively dovish.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.700]   He actually walked through his secret plan. He's he said, I
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.980]   can't remember where this clip but he said whenever he met with
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.460]   these folks, he basically left a 10% chance that he would nuke
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.780]   them. That's what he said. And it turned out that that 10% was
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.220]   just enough for the for everybody. Just enough crazy
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.180]   for everybody to stay alive.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.420]   It was just enough. I see. I think the US already has enough
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.380]   deterrence. I think we've maxed out on deterrence. I think the
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.220]   thing that was smart about Trump was that he was willing to do
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.540]   business. Yes, he was willing to negotiate and he didn't feel the
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:12.420]   need to make these moral condemnations all the time he was
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.420]   willing to meet with Kim Jong Un, he was willing to meet with
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:22.220]   Putin and and Xi Jinping and he avoided criticizing them
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.020]   personally. He didn't call them dictators. He talked about
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:28.140]   how smart they are. Yeah, it's the art of the deal, right? I
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.340]   mean, at the end of the day, he's looking to do business. And
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.220]   we need a little bit more of that. And I think this is why
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.900]   Jared Kushner was successful is he went in there with the
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.100]   mindset of a businessman. Yeah, how do we find something that's
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.980]   beneficial to both sides?
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.060]   Totally right. I think that when Trump was elected, I was told
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.900]   that it was the end of the world. And that's what I
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.140]   thought. And I'd already underwritten him as an F. Okay.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.620]   And then four years into the presidency, he was probably
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:59.460]   like a C in my mind. And then as I get a little bit of distance
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:02.460]   away, I realized no, hold on a second, this guy was like a BB
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.140]   plus like he was pretty good. And unfortunately, the few
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:11.340]   things that if he if he could have just pushed through, would
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.900]   have really saved America, the biggest one being these 100 year
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.780]   bonds, it, it would have kept America from getting to the
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.780]   precipice of fiscal ruin. And we'd be in a highly different
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:24.060]   situation. And I'm not sure we could have ever given him credit
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.820]   for it. But the further and further I get away from him, and
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.460]   the less emotional I am. He did a pretty good job. He was a
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.180]   pretty good president.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.700]   Don't forget that he tried to overturn the election and steal
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.220]   the election.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.540]   I voted for Hillary Clinton, I voted for Joe Biden. But this is
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.660]   the honest assessment the guy did for the things that he was
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.620]   supposed to do a good job. And for where every other president
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.220]   found a way to frankly make our situation a little bit worse,
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:53.540]   specifically around wars, he did not do that. And that is a
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.460]   huge accomplishment that I think needs to be acknowledged.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.900]   And he would have ripped up the Constitution and taken the
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.500]   presidency and stolen it. So just give that in mind as well.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:06.940]   Less we get him. That's it. Yeah, that's why he's not. That's
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.300]   why he's not an A. He's a B plus.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.620]   Okay, so you have to admit if it weren't for the black swan of
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.300]   COVID, he would have been reelected in a landslide
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.140]   landslide. It's quite possible he would have been reelected.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.660]   Yeah, I mean, I and also, yeah, it's by the way, I mean, it's
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.500]   great the way things are going in this country right now, both
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.340]   economically and internationally. He's gonna
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.580]   waltz into the White House, he's gonna spend all of his time in
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:34.340]   the next year in in the courthouses, battling all these
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.540]   lawsuits, the lawfare against him. He's not gonna be able to
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.140]   campaign and it won't even matter. Because people are going
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.220]   to be so done with this.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.260]   And nobody wants him as president again. So I think
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.420]   that's that nobody wants that. Everybody wants new choices.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.100]   All right, everybody, if you do not want to hear us talk about
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.580]   complex issues in the world, you can unsubscribe from the pod,
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.020]   we're going to be here every week having hard discussions,
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.780]   listening to each other and learning together. You don't
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.980]   have to agree with any one of us. But we are. We're happy to
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:09.540]   have the difficult conversations and learn every week here. And
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:15.820]   yeah, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and the
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.300]   friends of those impacted by this heinous terrorist attack.
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.540]   And I don't know if anybody has any other closing remarks here.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:27.300]   But obviously, we're heartbroken. And we hope that
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.900]   peace prevails and that the hostages are released as
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:30.780]   quickly as possible.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.140]   Well said.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:36.500]   All right, everybody, this is Episode 149 of the All In
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.420]   podcast. Next week, we'll we'll talk about all the different
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.700]   topics. But for this week, we're gonna let it sit where it is
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.100]   right now.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.060]   See you next time, bye-bye.
