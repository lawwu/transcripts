[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.060]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.600]   Today, my guest is Dr. Noam Sobel.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.920]   Dr. Noam Sobel is a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.600]   in the Department of Brain Sciences
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840]   at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.160]   His laboratory studies olfaction and chemosensation.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.720]   Olfaction is, of course, our sense of smell.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.320]   Chemosensation is our ability
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.760]   to respond to chemicals in our environment.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.620]   Today, you are going to learn
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.320]   some absolutely incredible facts
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.120]   about how you interact with the world
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.840]   and other people around you.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.760]   For instance, you will learn
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.520]   that humans can smell things around them
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.480]   as well as dogs can.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.920]   In fact, humans are incredibly good
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.360]   at sensing the chemical world around them.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.600]   You also learn, for instance,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.480]   that every time you meet somebody,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.860]   you are taking chemicals from that person,
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.200]   either from the chemical cloud that surrounds them
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.420]   or directly from the surface of their body,
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.980]   and you are actually applying it to your own body,
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.940]   and you are processing information
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.420]   about that person's chemicals
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.200]   to determine many things about them,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.180]   including how stressed they are, their hormone levels,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.220]   things that operate at a subconscious level
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.780]   on your brain and nervous system,
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.900]   and that impact your emotions, your decision-making,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.820]   and who you choose to relate to or not to relate to.
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.500]   You will also learn that tears,
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.460]   yes, the tears of others,
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.220]   are impacting your hormone levels in powerful ways.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.100]   You will also learn that every so often,
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.340]   actually on a regular schedule,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.680]   there is an alternation of ease
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.740]   through which you can breathe
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.840]   through one nostril or the other,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.420]   and that alternation reflects an underlying dynamic
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.060]   of your nervous system and has a lot to do
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.880]   with how alert or sleepy you happen to be.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.100]   The list of things that Dr. Noam Sobel's laboratory
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.420]   has discovered that relate to everyday life
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.060]   and that are going to make you say,
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.180]   "Wow, I can't believe that happens,"
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.380]   but then go out into the real world
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.140]   and actually observe that that happens
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.300]   in ways that are incredibly interesting,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.700]   just goes on and on.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.680]   In fact, his laboratory discovered
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.280]   that we are always sensing our own odors.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.120]   That's right.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.740]   Even though you might not notice your own smell,
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.020]   you are always sensing your own odor cloud,
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.020]   and throughout the day,
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.060]   you periodically smell yourself deliberately,
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.960]   even though you might not realize it,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.100]   in order to change your cognition and behavior.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.980]   I first learned of Dr. Sobel's laboratory
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.700]   through a rather odd observance.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.260]   That observance took place when I was a graduate student
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.360]   many years ago at UC Berkeley.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.140]   At the time, Noam Sobel was a professor at UC Berkeley.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.700]   As I mentioned before, he has since moved to the Weizmann.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.860]   Well, I was walking through the Berkeley campus
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.600]   and I saw people on their hands and knees,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.180]   but with their head very close to the ground,
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.020]   and their eyes were covered, their hands were covered,
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.380]   their mouths were covered,
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.380]   and only their nose was exposed.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.640]   And what I was observing was an experiment being conducted
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.220]   by the Sobel Laboratory,
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.100]   in which humans were following a scent trail.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.880]   That scent trail was actually buried some depth
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.300]   underneath the earth,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.420]   and yet they could follow that scent trail
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.260]   with a high degree of fidelity.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.140]   It was from that experiment and other experiments
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.080]   done in Dr. Sobel's laboratory at Berkeley
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.500]   and at the Weizmann, involving neuroimaging
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.640]   and a number of other tools and techniques
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.260]   that revealed the incredible power of human olfaction,
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.600]   and human's ability to follow scent trails if they need to.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.980]   And that of course led to many other important discoveries,
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.340]   some of which I alluded to a few moments ago,
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.100]   but you are going to learn about many,
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.100]   many other important discoveries
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.540]   in the realm of olfaction and chemosensation
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.700]   that have been carried out by Dr. Sobel's laboratory
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.340]   through the course of today's episode.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.740]   And by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.180]   I assure you that you will never look at
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.580]   or smell the world around you the same way again.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.240]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.900]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.080]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.660]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.300]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.420]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.340]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.380]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.740]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.540]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.700]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.220]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.920]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.040]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.200]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.060]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.820]   So no matter whether or not you're wearing them for sport,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.940]   whether or not you're wearing them for work
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.860]   or for socializing, you can always see with crystal clarity.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.780]   Their glasses are extremely lightweight,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.100]   so most of the time you don't even realize
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.020]   that you're wearing them.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.460]   I wear Roca readers at night,
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.180]   and sometimes when I drive at night,
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.460]   and I wear Roca sunglasses throughout the day,
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.080]   except, of course, I do not wear them
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.660]   for my morning sunlight viewing.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.140]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.580]   go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.800]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.880]   Again, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.040]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.640]   Thesis makes custom nootropics,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.280]   and nootropics is a word that I do not like
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.440]   because it means smart drugs.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.960]   As a neurobiologist, I can tell you
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.000]   that there is no neural circuit in your brain
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.840]   for being smart.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.140]   There are neural circuits for focus,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.460]   there are neural circuits for memory,
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.460]   there are neural circuits for creativity,
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.060]   and there are neural circuits for task switching.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.900]   Thesis understands that there's a diversity
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.280]   of neural circuits that support different brain body states,
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.880]   and therefore design nootropics that are customized
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.120]   to achieve specific brain body states.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.040]   If you go to Thesis website and take a brief quiz,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.400]   they will design a nootropic starter kit.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.240]   Some of those nootropics that they'll send you
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.820]   are designed to enhance your focus,
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.060]   others for clarity, others for creativity, and so on.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.440]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.160]   you can go to takethesis.com/huberman
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.600]   and take a three-minute quiz,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.540]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.920]   to try in your first month.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.280]   That's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.840]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.020]   to get 10% off your first order.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.840]   Helix Sleep makes customized mattresses and pillows
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.720]   that allow you to get the best possible night's sleep.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.280]   So if you go to the Helix website,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   you can take a very brief quiz,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.600]   it only takes about two minutes,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.120]   and answer questions such as,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.520]   do you tend to sleep on your back or your side
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.360]   or your stomach?
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.780]   Do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.700]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions,
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.420]   but they'll match you to a mattress
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.020]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.560]   For me, that was the DUSK mattress,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.500]   which is not too firm and not too soft,
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.720]   and I've been sleeping on it for more than two years
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.600]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.400]   If you'd like to try a Helix mattress,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.900]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.900]   take that two-minute quiz,
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.860]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.900]   and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.040]   and two free pillows.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.120]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.780]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.960]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.920]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Noam Sobel.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.800]   Dr. Sobel, Noam, welcome.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.640]   - Thank you.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.280]   - Must say, I am extremely excited for this conversation.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.120]   I've been a huge fan of your work
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.800]   for more than a decade or two.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.640]   Yes.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.880]   - Kind of frightening.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.400]   - We overlapped at UC Berkeley some time ago,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.320]   although we did not meet.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.060]   - Although we lived in the same apartment.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.480]   - And we just learned that the amazing apartment
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.260]   that you moved out of was the apartment
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.560]   that my girlfriend and I, at the time,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.260]   moved into in 2006, I believe.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.900]   So we've shared quite a few things.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.400]   And today I'd love for you to share with us
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.360]   all about the amazing landscape of chemosensation,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.000]   in particular olfaction, our sense of smell,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.620]   and some related perceptual abilities
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.080]   or subconscious abilities,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.720]   including pheromones, et cetera.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.260]   To get everybody on the same page,
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.800]   I'd like to just start off by asking,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.300]   what are the major components of our ability to smell?
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.840]   Obviously, where I like to think it involves the nose
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.680]   at some level.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.500]   - It does.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.540]   - To what extent is that mixed in with other senses,
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.540]   like taste?
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.800]   And perhaps more importantly,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.020]   what about the chemicals that we are sensing
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.540]   through this thing?
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.640]   And for those of you listening and not watching,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.000]   I'm tapping my nose, that we are not aware of.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.560]   You know, the chemicals that we're inhaling
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.760]   and making sense of without our awareness.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.540]   If you could just give us the top contour,
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.240]   or even deep contour, if you like,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   of the parts list and the various roles they play.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.000]   - So you've asked a lot of questions at once.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.720]   You know, I'll start with a little comment
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.960]   on the way you said smelling through our nose,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.800]   which we indeed do.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.080]   We also smell through our mouth, actually.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.660]   There's a process referred to as retronasal olfaction,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.840]   where odorants come up through the back of our throat
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.140]   and out of our nose the reverse way.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.520]   And we smell things that way as well.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.620]   And in fact, a big part of the contribution of olfaction
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.380]   to food and taste comes from that,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   from retronasal olfaction.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.120]   But primary olfaction is referred to as orthonasal olfaction,
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.920]   that is through our nose we sniff,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.320]   and sniffing is a big thing.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   Well, I have a sense we might talk about that a lot today
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.040]   in all sorts of contexts.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.000]   So we sniff in through our nose.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.560]   And to answer your general question
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.440]   of the organization of the system,
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.120]   so molecules, airborne molecules, travel up our nose
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.660]   a distance in the human of about six or seven centimeters
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.880]   to about here, where they interact with,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.560]   I will use the word sheet of receptors,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.120]   but sheet is a bit misleading here.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.180]   It's not a sheet, it's very convoluted.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.640]   We have about seven million such receptors
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.540]   aligning a structure known as the olfactory epithelium.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.240]   This is the sensory surface of the olfactory system,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   the olfactory epithelium.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.240]   Again, probably about six or seven million receptors
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.440]   in the human.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.440]   In the human, probably of about 350 different kinds.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.880]   So that's amazing.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.320]   That means a meaningful percentage of your genome
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.000]   is devoted just to this,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.760]   just to the kinds of olfactory receptor subtypes
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.280]   you have in your nose.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.800]   By the way, I can share an amusing story.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.080]   I would imagine amusing stories are good for podcasts.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.800]   So that number of six or seven million receptors
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.280]   is probably not very well grounded.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.840]   It's hard to count, but it's reasonably grounded.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.400]   And there was this thing roaming around in the literature
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.320]   about bloodhounds having a billion receptors in their nose,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.240]   which is why they're so amazing.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.600]   And this number, it sort of propagated
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.960]   through the literature.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.360]   And our lab has written over the years
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.840]   a few review chapters,
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.600]   and we were repeatedly writing the olfaction chapter
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.160]   for a very large, one of these large textbooks,
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.400]   the "Gazaniga Handbook of Cognitive Neuroscience"
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   I think it's called.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.760]   And we had that in there as well somewhere.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.400]   And one time when we were renewing the chapter
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.680]   for a new version of the book,
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.160]   I told the graduate student who was leading that at the time,
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.720]   Araya Sharoon, she's now a professor at Tel Aviv University.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.240]   I told her, check that, check that reference out.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.800]   Where in the world did that come from?
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.200]   And we started going back and back and back.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.520]   And it turns out it comes from a textbook,
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.560]   an Australian textbook.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.200]   And we found the author of the textbook and we wrote her.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.600]   And I said, look, there's this thing in the literature
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.240]   of a billion receptors in the bloodhound.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.040]   Where did that come from?
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.200]   And surprisingly, she answered me.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.480]   And I was hoping to get a reference, right?
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.960]   But it wasn't a reference.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.200]   And this is where it really becomes funny for us
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.800]   because she said, I was once at a lecture
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.480]   of an olfaction geneticists,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.560]   geneticist by the name of Daron Lancet.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.360]   And he said that in the lecture.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.280]   Now, this is really funny because she's in Australia.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.240]   This is all over the world, this number.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.160]   And I'm writing her from Israel.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.800]   And Daron Lancet is in the building next to me, okay?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.360]   He's in Weizmann Institute of Genetics.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.160]   I mean, he used to be, he's retired now.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.320]   And he had meaningful contributions
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.720]   in the history of olfaction.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.760]   So I picked up the internal phone and I said,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.840]   hey, Daron, did you say that there's a billion receptors
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.080]   in the bloodhound nose?
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.720]   And he said, what's a bloodhound?
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.200]   So this is totally made up, right?
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.920]   It totally made up and it propagated.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.880]   I mean, you can probably go into Google
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.040]   and type like a billion receptors in the bloodhound
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.840]   and you'll get a lot of hits.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.880]   But there was absolutely no evidence for that.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.720]   - Amazing.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   And not just amazing in light of what it tells us
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.760]   about olfaction and bloodhounds or otherwise,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.600]   but amazing because it sheds light
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.760]   on just how much of what is in textbooks,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.920]   scientific and medical is absolutely wrong.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.720]   Things propagate and you cite yourself.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.800]   So we fixed that in that version of the...
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.960]   And so to finish the line,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.160]   so odorants interact with these receptors
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   here in our epithelium where they undergo
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.960]   what is referred to as transduction.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.280]   That is the odorants are docked at a receptor
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.080]   and turn into a neural signal or enforce the receptor
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.000]   to respond in a neural signal.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.680]   And this neural signal, in fact, action potentials,
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.280]   not gradient potentials of any kind,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.200]   propagates via the olfactory nerve.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.920]   Now this is a nerve that goes from our epithelium
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.760]   right here.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.800]   - Behind the forehead.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.120]   - No, well, yeah, here.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   Through the thinnest part of our skull,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.920]   an area referred to as the cribriform plate,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.560]   which is perforated, it has a lot of holes.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.640]   The nerve goes through those holes
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.440]   and synapses at the first target in the brain,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.240]   which is the olfactory bulb.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   In humans, that forms an interesting point of sensitivity
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.920]   because a lot of people lose their sense of smell
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.280]   due to trauma because of that structure.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.520]   - A head-hit type trauma.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.480]   - Well, yes, although you denoted hitting
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.360]   on the front of the head,
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.300]   which is where all this real estate is,
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.960]   but actually the more common cause
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.360]   for losing your sense of smell for trauma
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.640]   is the back of the head
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.280]   because of what's referred to as a contrecu injury.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.520]   So as your listeners probably know,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.000]   our brain is floating in liquid in CSF,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.840]   in cerebrospinal fluid inside our skull.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.000]   And when we get hit in the back of the head,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.360]   the brain has this forward and backward movement
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.960]   in the liquid in the skull.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.160]   It sort of crashes.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.200]   It can crash against the front of the skull,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.840]   which is why you also have, in a contrecu injury,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.700]   you also often have frontal damage.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.760]   But what happens is that this generates a shearing motion
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.420]   on the cribriform plate
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.480]   and the olfactory nerve is severed.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.440]   And if it's completely severed, it's lost.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.920]   - Forever, because my understanding is
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.540]   that the olfactory sensory neurons
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.200]   are among the few central nervous system neurons
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.380]   in adult humans that can regenerate
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.080]   or replenish themselves.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.640]   - Right, so again, there are a few questions in one.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.480]   - Yeah, that's okay.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.320]   - So first of all--
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.840]   - We will spin many plates simultaneously.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.880]   - If it's completely severed, completely,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.160]   then yes, you're lost.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.000]   - Forever.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.560]   - Yeah, if it's completely severed.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.100]   Because even if you'll have regeneration
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.040]   at the basal cell level at the epithelium,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.280]   they won't manage to find their way back to the bulb.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.200]   If you have partial or something left
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.000]   or something shows up in a short while after the injury,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.080]   then you have a good chance of recovery.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   - Because they grow along the trajectory
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.680]   of the other axons, sort of pioneering the way for them.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.840]   - Assumingly, yeah.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.680]   - Interesting.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.320]   So basically, and basically the timeframe,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   and you know, it's funny, I get a lot of emails on this,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.460]   although I'm not a medical doctor,
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.240]   but I get a lot of emails from people
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.360]   who have lost their sense of smell
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.760]   because it's very distressing.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.520]   And now more people know this because of COVID,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   that it's very distressing.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.480]   And basically the rule of thumb is that
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.740]   if you don't get it back within a year to a year and a half,
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.920]   you'll never get it back.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.940]   - My understanding of the statistics on olfactory loss
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.660]   and COVID and other viral type infections is that,
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.940]   first of all, I experienced that when I got COVID.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.500]   - Including total anosmia?
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.540]   - For one day and not total.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.020]   It was just, there was a remnant of an ability to smell
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.100]   or perceive the smell of a lemon.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.020]   And I was huffing as hard as I possibly could.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.500]   I actually, there's an over-the-counter remedy,
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.300]   and this is not a pseudoscience
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.140]   because there's a number of papers published
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.980]   about this on PubMed,
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.980]   that alpha lipoic acid can accelerate the recovery of smell.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.180]   And so that's something that, it worked successfully for me.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.260]   I'm not saying that that's the only route.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.740]   - You don't know if it worked successfully for you
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.980]   or if you would have recovered anyway.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.420]   I mean, you didn't do a controlled study.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.780]   - But I was not willing to do the controlled experiment.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.860]   Exactly.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.500]   - Let me say two things on this front.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.940]   First, the dean on the alpha lipoic acid is, ugh.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.780]   - Yeah, it's not overwhelming.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.260]   But losing your sense of smell is overwhelming.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.140]   And so I think people feel desperate.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.180]   - One word about the smelling the lemon,
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.220]   and this is, I'll take that opportunity
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.140]   to share more information.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.180]   When we smell things, it's the result
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.740]   of more sensory subsystems than the olfactory system alone.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.780]   So you have several chemosensory-sensitive nerves
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.460]   in your nose.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.540]   A primary one beyond the olfactory nerve
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.460]   is the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.220]   So the trigeminal nerve has sensory endings
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.260]   in your nose, in your throat, and in your eye.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.660]   It has three branches.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.780]   That's why an onion has smell and burns your eyes
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.100]   and burns in your throat.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.940]   - Is that why?
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.780]   - It's trigeminal, yeah.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.380]   - The tearing of cutting an onion is--
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   - Trigeminal, it's a trigeminal reflex.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.220]   - Amazing.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.460]   We talked about trigeminal in the context of headache
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   during a headache episode.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.580]   - It's a trigeminal reflex.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.820]   So the lemon you were smelling
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.660]   may have been a trigeminal sensation.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.100]   - So smelling the lemon with my eyes is what you're saying?
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.940]   - Well, no, with your nose.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.780]   - No, with my nose.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.140]   - Trigeminal receptors are not your olfactory receptors.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.700]   So within olfaction research or jargon,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.420]   there's what we refer to as pure olfactants.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.340]   These are odors that will stimulate
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.860]   your olfactory nerve alone.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.820]   They won't influence your trigeminal nerve at all.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.100]   And an example, just to get a sense of what that might be,
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.300]   would be the coffee right here is a pure olfactant.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.420]   Vanilla is a known pure olfactant.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.620]   These things have no trigeminal activation.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.460]   As long as we're on this topic
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.700]   and we'll weave back and forth,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.820]   but I'm glad we are on this topic
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.180]   because a tremendous number of people
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.700]   wrote to me during the pandemic
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.740]   and continue to about olfactory loss.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.620]   I've heard of this olfactory training
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.460]   whereby if you have a partial or even a complete loss
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.340]   of primary olfaction that one is encouraged
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.260]   to smell a number of different smells.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.060]   I grew up studying activity dependent wiring
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:58.900]   of the nervous system.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.020]   It makes total sense to me why keeping neurons active
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.220]   keeps them alive.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.060]   So this is not fire together, wire together type thing.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.540]   By the way, that's a quote from Carla Schatz,
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.180]   not Donald Head folks or me.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.140]   But this is about keeping neurons electrically active,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.660]   in this case olfactory neurons,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   in order to maintain their connections
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.260]   because otherwise they will die.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:24.100]   - Olfaction is a definite use it or lose it system.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.420]   And so that makes total sense.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.780]   And indeed there's very strong evidence for success
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.660]   of the training programs, more than the alpha lipoic acid.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.500]   - Great to know.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.780]   - And so that's a real thing.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.580]   And what's cool about that is that you don't need to go out
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.980]   and buy expensive things, although you can.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.500]   Of course, there are people who are capitalizing
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.780]   on this commercially already,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.380]   but you can just take things from your refrigerator
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.260]   or your makeup cabinet or whatever and smell them
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.140]   intentionally and constantly and sniff them.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.780]   And that exposure will help you recover.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.380]   There is good data on that by now.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.420]   You made that point in passing about regeneration
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.780]   in the olfactory system.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.220]   And one of the cool things, so in olfaction,
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.860]   you can study many things through olfaction.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.300]   Indeed, one of them is neuro regeneration
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.100]   because the olfactory neurons are really the only neurons
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.780]   that do that systematically in the adult mammalian brain.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.780]   And whether the human olfactory system shows the same level
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.020]   of regeneration as it does in other mammals
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.020]   is and was somewhat questionable.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.740]   And I'm just bringing that up to share a really cool study
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.700]   that was published in Neuron, I think somewhere around 2014,
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.460]   where to address this question,
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.180]   I just really liked the idea of doing that.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.180]   What the authors did was look at,
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.340]   in post-mortem, they looked at levels of C-14
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.340]   in adults who were exposed to atomic bomb experiments.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.260]   So you can actually look at these neurons
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.700]   and time them based on exposure to radiation.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:16.540]   And that paper suggested that there's not as much turnover
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.100]   in the human olfactory bulb as there is in other mammals.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.860]   Other lines of data suggest otherwise.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.500]   So this is kind of a debated question
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.380]   as to what extent of neurodegeneration you have
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:34.020]   in the human olfactory system as opposed to other mammals.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.820]   But that was just a really cool paper, I think,
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.140]   of doing that.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.060]   - Fascinating.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.100]   - Should I finish the path just so we have the,
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.740]   so information then synapses at the olfactory bulb
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.140]   from the olfactory epithelium.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.500]   And the pattern of that synapsing follows
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.860]   what's referred to as the most extreme case of convergence
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.180]   in the mammalian nervous system.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.220]   More specifically, what happens is that all the receptors
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.180]   of a given subtype, and remember in humans,
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.100]   we said we have about 350.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.860]   In the mouse, we have about 1,200 probably.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.780]   So all the receptors of one subtype converge
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.220]   to one location in the bulb.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.740]   And this location is referred to as a glomerulus
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.580]   or an imploro glomeruli.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.660]   And that may be a slight oversimplification.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.140]   It's in fact two glomeruli.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.660]   There's a mirror, sort of a mirror cut line.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.580]   And so all the receptors of one subtype will converge
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.020]   to two mirror glomeruli on the olfactory bulb.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.420]   So you end up having two glomeruli that reflect
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.700]   that one receptor subtype.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.300]   And so if, and this is as far as, I'm giving you now
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.740]   the textbook view of how the system works.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.900]   But then I can, I'll happily share with you things
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.700]   that pose a problem for the textbook view
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.060]   of how things work.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.580]   But the textbook view of how things work
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.340]   is that every such receptor subtype is responsive
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.300]   to a small subset of different molecular shapes,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.260]   what's sometimes referred to as ototopes,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.100]   the molecular aspects of the odorant.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.940]   So each receptor is responsive to a different subset
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.980]   of ototopes, let's say 10.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.900]   And each ototope will activate
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.260]   a different subset of receptors.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.940]   So potentially you have this insane combinatorics
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.740]   of this potentially 350 dimensional space
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.060]   in the human, potentially.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.940]   But then because of this convergence,
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.180]   you end up having on the bulb in a way a map
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.860]   reflecting receptor identity.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.100]   So let's say this coffee activates receptors
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   of type 1, 3, and 7.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.700]   So the glomeruli of receptors 1, 3, and 7
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.580]   will light up, quote unquote, when I smell the coffee.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.620]   And if you can take a snapshot of that,
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.300]   theoretically you would have the map of coffee
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.820]   and so on and so forth.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.580]   This is sort of the textbook view of how the system works.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.620]   And then information goes from the bulb
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.740]   to several targets in the brain.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.220]   I mean, what is referred to as primary olfactory cortex
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.060]   is piriform cortex and enthorhinal cortex.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.020]   This is on the ventral surface of the brain,
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.980]   the lower portion of our temporal lobe.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.580]   And information goes there directly,
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.020]   but it also goes directly to the amygdala.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.660]   It probably goes directly to the hypothalamus.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.540]   It may go directly to the cerebellum.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.180]   It goes all over the brain.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.340]   So information projects widely from there.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.020]   And as far as people understand,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.500]   the map that may exist on the bulb
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.140]   doesn't exist in the rest of the brain.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.940]   And the understanding of how coding occurs
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.420]   in the rest of the brain is murky.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.180]   - Commonly one hears that the memories
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.820]   that we have of odors are somehow more robust
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.820]   than the memories of other perceptual events in our life.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.900]   I don't know if this is true or not,
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.340]   but people will say, for instance,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.420]   I can still remember the smell of my grandmother's hands
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.380]   or the smell of cookies in her kitchen.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.980]   At a minimum, it points to the fact that smell and memory
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.020]   are closely linked.
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   And you just mentioned a direct, you know, multi-station,
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.300]   but nonetheless, somewhat direct path
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.980]   from the nostrils to the hippocampus,
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.820]   one of the primary encoding centers of memories.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.860]   - Two synapses away.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.980]   - Yeah, which is a remarkably short pathway,
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.660]   considering that, for instance, just by example,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.660]   'cause some of our listeners won't be familiar with this,
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.940]   but some will, that sound waves
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.300]   that are transduced into neural signals
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.980]   at the level of the inner ear go through many stations
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.860]   before they arrive at the location in the brain
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.940]   where we make sense of those sound waves
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.780]   as voices or music, et cetera,
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.580]   whereas olfaction is more of a direct route
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.580]   to the memory centers.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:50.540]   Is there any just so story or real objective truth
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.300]   to the idea that olfactory memories are formed more easily
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.980]   or maintained longer or more robustly
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.780]   than other sorts of memories?
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.700]   - So, yes.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.140]   But first, I should say that I'm not an authority
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.260]   on olfactory memory.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.380]   It's sort of, olfactory memory is a huge field of research,
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.380]   and somehow, our lab has never really gone much into that,
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.820]   although, again, the same student
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.740]   I happened to talk about before, Yarai Sharun,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.140]   who's, again, now a faculty at Tel Aviv,
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.300]   ran a study, a paper, I think we published
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.460]   in Current Biology called The Privileged Representation
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.380]   of Early Olfactory Associations.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.860]   Basically, there's something about the first time
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.700]   you experience a smell that generates
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.460]   a particularly robust representation
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.260]   more than other sensory stimuli,
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.260]   and that's what she, in fact, compared.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.180]   So, there's something about the first exposure to a smell
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.180]   in terms of the brain encoding
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.780]   that etches it into our being.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.220]   And this is an effect that has, you know,
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.220]   it has echoes, of course, in literature.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.060]   I mean, you know, the biggest cliche in this
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.540]   is to bring up the Proust effect, right?
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.500]   So, the Proust effect is when he ate the madeleine,
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.540]   and then immediately, the taste and smell immediately
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.940]   reminded him of an event in his childhood
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.340]   where the same madeleine appeared.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.620]   But, so that's something very real.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.380]   There's a lot of research on it not coming from our work,
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.900]   so I'm not an authority.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.700]   - But it does sound like there's something special
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.860]   about olfaction, and that doesn't mean
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.660]   that there isn't something special about vision or audition.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.140]   Each one has its own unique tone.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.940]   - I'm the last to argue that there's something special
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.620]   about olfaction.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.580]   My students make fun of me because they say,
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.860]   and there's some truth to that,
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.580]   that I try to explain everything
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.740]   through the olfactory system.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.100]   I mean, for me, everything is olfactory, so yes.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.700]   - Through the lens of the nose.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.220]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.300]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.740]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.120]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.020]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.700]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.920]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.520]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.580]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.580]   once or usually twice a day
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.500]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.180]   that I need for gut health.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.300]   Our gut is very important.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.820]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.580]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.980]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.620]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.500]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.320]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.900]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.300]   vitamins, and minerals that make sure
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.260]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.140]   and it tastes great.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.580]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.980]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.940]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.260]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.840]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.260]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.940]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.320]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.420]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.480]   When I was at Berkeley,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.860]   I was walking across campus one day,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.980]   and I saw, I think, students,
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.760]   but I saw people on their hands and knees
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.180]   with goggles on, gloves on,
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.940]   and I think their mouths were covered too?
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.780]   - Everything was covered.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.180]   - Was covered, and they were walking,
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.020]   well, they were crawling along the ground,
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.640]   and I thought this was peculiar,
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.520]   but then again, it's UC Berkeley,
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.180]   and the joke is if it,
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.840]   to get noticed on the UC Berkeley campus,
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.780]   you have to be naked and on fire, right?
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.340]   One or the other would not be sufficient.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.540]   Please don't run this experiment, anybody.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.400]   It's that kind of place.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.240]   - Yeah.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.960]   - But nonetheless, a paper came out a few years later,
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.340]   describing the results of what turned out
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.520]   to be your experiment that your laboratory was running,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.860]   which was having people follow an odor trail
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.260]   with their nose,
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:04.020]   and my understanding is that people can improve
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.560]   their ability to track sense quite robustly,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.580]   especially if we deprive them of vision
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.740]   and somatic sensation that is touch
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.320]   and some other sensations.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.180]   Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about that study,
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.860]   and for, I think in our audience,
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.440]   I'm suspecting that many people have a keen,
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.000]   keen sense of smell.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.700]   I have a family member who just like can detect
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.300]   any negative, you know, putrid odor in the environment,
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.960]   but also good odors, exquisitely well,
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.080]   and I have other family members whose sense of smell
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   is quite poor.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:44.060]   I'd love for all of those people to learn a bit
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.500]   about what is possible in terms of training up
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.440]   or improving our ability to smell,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.960]   perhaps in the context of that study, if you will.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.500]   - Yeah, so first, before even talking about improving,
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.500]   just off the bat, humans have a remarkable sense of smell,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.840]   and this is something, again, in our lab,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.700]   we already said, you know, yeah, we know this.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.540]   This is old news, but to people who come
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.360]   from different worlds, we have to reiterate this.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.040]   Sometimes when I give, you know, public lectures
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.540]   to non-olfaction audiences, I reiterate this.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.200]   Humans have an utterly remarkable sense of smell.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.240]   To put that a bit into sort of, you know,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.540]   things that are tangible.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.140]   So for example, mercaptans, which are added
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.680]   to cooking gas so that we smell it,
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.320]   because otherwise it wouldn't have a smell,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.220]   so that the smell of gas, it's not the smell of gas,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.520]   of propane, it's an additive.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.360]   - Mercaptan?
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.920]   - Yeah, it's mercaptan.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   - The sulfur-like smell?
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.480]   - Yeah, so our detection threshold,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.060]   that is the level at which we can detect it,
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.040]   is 0.2 parts per billion.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.980]   Okay, there's no machine that can really do that
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   that effectively, no gas chromatograph, nothing.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.440]   Now, to give you another sense of making this,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.780]   again, really tangible, we're working with an odorant
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.900]   in our lab called estra tetra enol
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:08.480]   that our participants can detect when we have it mixed
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.540]   at 10 to the negative 12 molar in the liquid phase.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.960]   To give you a real sense of that, we did the math,
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.820]   if you would take two Olympic-size swimming pools
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.360]   and you would pipe it one ml, one drop,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.800]   into one pool versus the other,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.760]   you could smell the difference between the pools.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.600]   - Incredible.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.080]   - That's the detection threshold
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.900]   that you have with your nose.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.560]   People have an utterly amazing nose, okay?
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.200]   So that's just in terms of its detection abilities,
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.600]   which are just remarkable, really up there
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.620]   in the mammalian world.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.000]   We're not a bad mammal in all factions.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.720]   And beyond that, we can improve, okay?
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.240]   And the example you're talking about
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.040]   actually started off as a lab bet, okay?
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.200]   We were having a lab picnic.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.280]   So I guess I should hear Phil in because I'm your guest
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.160]   from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.600]   but before going back to my home in Israel,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.960]   I was a faculty at UC Berkeley
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.360]   in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.280]   And this study was done during that time.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.840]   And we were on a lab picnic and we were having indeed
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.060]   one of these sort of lab discussions arguments
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.880]   on what humans can and can't do with their sense of smell.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.720]   And I said that humans could truly even track odor
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.400]   like a dog and people there said, "No way."
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.940]   And we ran this quick experiment, which I have video of,
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.520]   but I don't think we'll show it here.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.360]   But I actually have a real, the picnic video, we have it.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.760]   And a graduate student by the name of Christina Zolano,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.560]   a brilliant graduate student at that time,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.700]   who's now, she's now a professor at Northwestern.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.800]   And she's really leading the field
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   of all faction imaging today.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.240]   But she was the volunteer and we dragged a chocolate bar
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.480]   across the grass and blindfolded her
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.600]   and checked if she could track the track we made
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.120]   with the chocolate, which she did very effectively.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.640]   - Did you place her at the starting point of the line?
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   - I think we did.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.160]   I don't exactly remember what we did
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.800]   on that sort of picnic tryout.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.840]   But I assume she'd never practiced that
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.080]   in her life before, right?
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.340]   And yet, she did it really, really well.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.480]   And then this went on as a lab bed in a way
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.120]   that I said to my students, okay,
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.280]   we have to make this into an experiment,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.360]   put it in an experimental setting
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   and quantify what's going on.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   And they all said that it would be uninteresting.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.320]   That was the bet.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.440]   And I told them it would be in nature,
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.680]   which is a bet I won in this case.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.120]   - Nature, of course, being one of the three apex journals.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.600]   - It was nature neuroscience, to be fair.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.080]   But so then we turned it into an experiment.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.120]   And what the experiment was is that we brought
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.040]   in participants, naive participants,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.600]   not graduate students from our lab,
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.560]   completely deprived them of any other sensory input.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.880]   So we blocked their eyes, we blocked their ears,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.400]   we blocked everything.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.240]   They were wearing heavy gloves.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.080]   They couldn't sense anything.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.880]   And we generated a consistent odor path in the grass,
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.480]   which is what you saw.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.240]   We did that by burying twine under the grass,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.700]   an odor impregnated twine.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.120]   So that way we could generate
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.840]   a consistent odor trail every time.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.200]   - Was it at the base of the grass or in the dirt?
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.280]   - It was buried.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.560]   It was buried under the grass.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.400]   - Really?
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.320]   - Wow, I did not know that.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.400]   - It was buried under the grass.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.960]   And we conducted aerial photography.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.920]   And participants also had this sensor pack
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.400]   that they were wearing where we measured
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.720]   nasal airflow in each nostril in real time.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.400]   And we also used something called RTK GPS,
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.860]   which is a way to lay a radio frequency grid
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.240]   over the GPS grid,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.080]   so that you have millimeter resolution in space basically.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.120]   It's used by surveyors mostly.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.160]   So that we could track behavior.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.840]   And we found a few things doing this.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.640]   One is that people could just do this right off the bat.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.840]   The second thing we found that is when we train them up,
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.400]   then within average of four days,
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.560]   the rate limiting factor became the speed
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   at which they could crawl.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.200]   So as fast as you could crawl, you could send track.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.840]   Of course, you can't crawl as fast as a dog can run.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.040]   But as fast as you can crawl, you can send track.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.060]   And then to sort of add what made it really interesting
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.440]   from a systems neuroscience perspective
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.660]   is that we asked whether having two nostrils
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.000]   contributes to this.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   So we built, we constructed a nasal prosthesis, if you will,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.940]   that had two versions.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.320]   One is that it combined both nostrils
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.600]   into one big nostril centered.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.360]   And the other is that it maintained
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.720]   two separated nostrils.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.460]   And we compared performance under these two conditions.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.520]   And people performed better with two nostrils
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.920]   over one centralized nostril,
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.260]   although the flow remained the same.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.240]   So you're taking advantage of the information
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.760]   that comes from your two separate,
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.500]   totally separate nostrils.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.220]   By the way, the system I described before
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.080]   of your epithelium and bulb and connection to cortex,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.280]   you have two of those, right?
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.900]   It's completely unilateral,
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.780]   well, almost completely unilateral system.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.500]   There are some very small exceptions to that.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.940]   - So a representation on both sides of the brain.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.700]   Much in the same way we have two eyes, we're not a cyclops.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.460]   We can gain depth perception information.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.140]   We can perceive motion better as a consequence
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.800]   and a number of depth, especially stereopsis.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.140]   - And we can locate sound
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.820]   because of the difference between our ears
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.620]   and how the head blocks them between.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.980]   - Amazing, another question about the mechanics
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.640]   and strategies that you observed,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.000]   because I think there's information about the system,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.700]   the brain as a consequence.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.540]   Were you in a position to measure sniffing frequency?
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.360]   And the specific question I have is,
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.700]   were people doing something along the lines
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.700]   of a quick sniffing or a long draw in inhale?
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:33.780]   - So yes, we were measuring sniffing and recording it
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.680]   and we have all the data.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:43.020]   There was nothing very remarkable in that data,
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.340]   in that study, although it may reflect
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.540]   that we didn't analyze it carefully enough as well.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.560]   I mean, it wasn't a major component of our analysis.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.540]   So although we did look at it to some extent,
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.960]   again, you're asking me about a paper
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.080]   from quite a few years ago,
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.800]   so I may be forgetting parts of it as well.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.560]   - But I'm sure if it was a major component of it,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.020]   it would have risen to the top.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.540]   - It definitely wasn't a major finding
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.660]   of the sniffing behavior in the paper.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.100]   Although again, sniffing behavior is a huge portion
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.800]   of our life in lab.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.340]   And it's taking us to places
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.480]   and it's re-emerging now in our work.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.660]   We're doing tons of sniffing work.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.500]   I can share with you something
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.460]   that I think will interest your listeners
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.720]   and viewers as well.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.720]   And we think is really one of the most overlooked things
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.160]   in neuroscience.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.380]   I'll invite you to do the following experiments.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.100]   So occlude one nostril by pressing on it from the side
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.740]   and sniff in, and then occlude the other and sniff in.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.180]   Do you sense a difference in flow?
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.020]   - Yes.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.200]   - Okay, do you know why that is?
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.520]   - No, and it was the next question on my list.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.420]   - Don't feel badly about not knowing why that is.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.540]   Most people don't.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.400]   But that is a reflection of something referred to
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.300]   as the nasal cycle.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   So in fact, if you were to do that repeatedly,
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.540]   you would find that your high flow nostril
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.160]   and low flow nostril alternate
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.100]   every two and a half hours on average.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.300]   In an absolute way, or is it kind of like a sine wave,
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.180]   like gradual shift to one and then gradual shift back?
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.060]   - It can vary.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.100]   It can vary, and we don't yet know the rules, all the rules.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.960]   But you have this constant shift from side to side.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.100]   The shift becomes incredibly pronounced in sleep.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.860]   So we can measure the power of the difference.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.540]   And in sleep, you have this phase shift of power.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.860]   You have a huge, like one closes and one opens totally.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   And it turns out that this is linked to balance
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.980]   in the autonomic nervous system.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.460]   So as you and your listeners know,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.140]   we have an autonomic nervous system
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.260]   that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.180]   And they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases,
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.020]   for example.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.020]   And this interplay between the sympathetic
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.380]   and parasympathetic nervous system drives the switch
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.460]   from left to right nostril.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.020]   - Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.100]   has nothing to do with sympathy.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.020]   Has everything to do with generating patterns of alertness.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.780]   It's sometimes called the fight or flight system,
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.540]   but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.740]   And then it's balanced in a coordinated way,
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.540]   or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.020]   nervous system, which is sometimes called
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.140]   the rest and digest system,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.420]   but is associated with all sorts of things.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.580]   The sexual arousal response and a number of other aspects
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.420]   of our physiology.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.260]   - Perfect.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.500]   So imagine, right, imagine you would walk around
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.620]   living your life, right?
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.420]   Half of the time with one eye closed like this,
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.020]   and the other half with one eye closed like this,
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.020]   and you had this eye cycle, right?
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.820]   And that was linked to autonomic arousal.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.340]   I assure you, you would go to PubMed,
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.900]   there would be five million papers on the eye cycle, right?
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.860]   And the eye cycle and every disease you can name
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.940]   and what it denotes and what it tells us
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.340]   and what we can do with it.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.100]   You have exactly this marker.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.260]   You're walking around with the marker on balance
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.020]   in your autonomic nervous system,
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.700]   and we do nothing with it.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.940]   So we're in fact now doing a lot with it, okay?
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:20.940]   So we built a wearable device that is pasted to your body
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.500]   and measures airflow in each nostril separately
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.940]   and logs it for 24 hours.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.260]   And we're collecting these 24 hour recordings.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.300]   We're calling it the nasal halter.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.060]   So we measure with the nasal halter,
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.700]   and we're finding it as a disease marker.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:44.580]   I can give you a nasal halter measurement as an adult,
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.020]   and I can say, this is work by Tim Nasaroka,
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.820]   a graduate student in our lab now.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.900]   I can, so we can tell the difference between ADHD
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.300]   and non-ADHD adults.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.740]   And we can tell just from the recording,
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.780]   we can tell if the adults are on Ritalin or not.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:04.140]   So I can measure your nasal airflow and say,
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.900]   if you are or are not with ADHD,
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.020]   and if you are or are not on Ritalin.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.060]   - Incredible.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.900]   I have a couple of questions about this.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.820]   Is it the case that airflow through one nostril
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.940]   is reflective of a sympathetic nervous system dominance
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.820]   versus parasympathetic, or is it simply the case
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.740]   that this alternating left-right nostril periodicity,
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.140]   which you said I think is on the order
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.180]   of about every two hours.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.180]   - Two and a half. - Two and a half.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:34.300]   It switches to maximal on one side versus the other.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.140]   Is that simply reflective of an overall balancing,
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.100]   maybe is it the hinge in the seesaw,
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.060]   or is it the tilt of the seesaw?
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.900]   - So I don't have a good answer.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.780]   I don't have a good answer.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.780]   I mean, I could give you sort of a,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.740]   I could say that to some extent,
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.900]   right nostril more open is more sympathetic,
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.820]   and left nostril more open is more parasympathetic,
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.980]   but that wouldn't be very correct.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.780]   I'm sure that the yogis are gonna be all over this, right?
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.820]   'Cause I get this, my lab does do some stuff on breathing,
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.260]   and the yogis are always saying,
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.820]   okay, you know, 'cause there's this thing,
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.940]   I don't do yoga anymore, not for any particular reason,
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.620]   but where they'll have you breathe
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.100]   through one nostril or the other.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.040]   And I've probably been asked this question
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.460]   on social media 10,000 times.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.620]   - Okay, wait, I'm gonna become public enemy
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.140]   number one of the yogis right now.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.020]   So listen, so we-
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.720]   - They'll come at you with yoga mats,
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.020]   which are not very dangerous.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.900]   - We really, so since we're so interested in this mechanism,
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.920]   one of the things we'd really like to know how to do
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.820]   is to gain control of it somehow.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.820]   And there's this world out there of yoga
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.400]   who claims to have control over this.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.780]   So we said, okay, let's bring like really serious
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.920]   yoga practitioners and see if they can shift
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.780]   their nasal cycle from left to right by will alone, right?
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.460]   Not by manipulating themselves somehow.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.740]   And if yes, we'll learn from them how they do this,
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:01.160]   and then we might use this to cure ADHD or whatnot, right?
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   So we posted like on all the lists of like the yoga teachers
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:11.240]   and had this parade of yoga teachers walking into our lab.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.620]   This was one of the strangest-
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.880]   - Lot of sandalwood odors and bare feet.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.760]   - White clothing and so on.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   And so we studied, I actually know,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.440]   we studied 14 yoga teachers,
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   all 14 by the conditions of enlistment for this
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.480]   came in saying that they can control
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.980]   shifting from left to right nostril.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.800]   - Without plugging a nostril with your finger.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.400]   - By the power of thought alone.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.280]   And you know how many of 14 succeeded?
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.200]   Zero, including one, you know, there was an extreme one
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.880]   where we had this guy who, and we're recording,
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.760]   and we know how to record this really well, right?
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.320]   And he's sitting there saying, yeah, I'm switching now
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.040]   and it's switching.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.400]   And you know, you're looking at the monitor
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.440]   and no, it's not switching.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.120]   And so no yoga teacher that we found
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.740]   could willfully switch between left and right nostril flow.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.640]   - And yet they are convinced that they are,
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.400]   and I have to imagine they're not trying to,
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.120]   you know, there's no incentive for them to lie, right?
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.360]   - Yeah, no, even the opposite.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.760]   I mean, you know, this puts them in an awkward position.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.200]   Yeah, I don't know what the deal is,
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.000]   but none of them can do it.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.600]   - Given that the alternating flow
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.880]   through one or the other nostrils
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.280]   reflective of the autonomic nervous system
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.080]   has this two and a half hour periodicity,
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.940]   if I suddenly enter a bout of stress, for instance,
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.780]   does it switch?
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.760]   Because that's reflective of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.480]   And the reason I'm asking this question
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.080]   is not because I think that's necessarily important
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.420]   as it relates to stress,
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.800]   but I'm trying to understand the direction of causality.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.080]   In other words, is the unilateral smelling,
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.520]   or unilateral nostril smelling periodicity,
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.040]   there when we named it something,
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.800]   I could name it the wrong thing, I'm sure.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.560]   Is that driving the shift in the autonomic nervous system,
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.480]   or is it merely reflective of the shift?
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.140]   - So you've very concisely now worded aim two of a grant
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.140]   that was probably just rejected,
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:13.660]   but basically we're trying to answer exactly that question,
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.440]   and we're currently running experiments on that line.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.140]   So we have one experiment
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.360]   where we're looking,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.280]   so we're exposing participants to pain.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.080]   We're using cold water hand exposure.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.160]   It's a really cool paradigm
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.820]   because there's huge individual differences.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.500]   We just started this, we built the setup just now,
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.680]   and you have a lot of meat to work with there
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.360]   because there's a lot of individual differences.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.820]   It's capped at three minutes for safety reasons
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.100]   because you have participants putting their hand
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.600]   in two degrees Celsius water,
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.520]   but there'll be participants who will pull it out
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.660]   at like 10 seconds, nine seconds,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.740]   and then you'll have three minutes as well.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.620]   So there's lots of, and already,
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.480]   so now I'm sharing pilot data with you,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.520]   so when this ends up being published,
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.360]   it might be the opposite,
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.620]   but so far it seems that the exposure to cold
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.680]   generates a shift in the nasal flow and nasal balance.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.940]   So autonomic arousal can drive the shift, potentially.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.280]   Earlier you were describing the architecture
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.180]   of these smelling systems,
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.320]   and you mentioned these glomeruli
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.040]   where the olfactory receptors converge in the bulb,
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.740]   and then later you mentioned that the system is unilateral,
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.960]   but with a mirror representation on both sides of the brain.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.240]   So for those who don't think in terms of neuroanatomy,
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.720]   what Noam was describing is the fact that,
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.600]   of course, there are two nostrils
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.720]   and then a bunch of receptors,
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.880]   they converge in these glomeruli,
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.600]   but you have a mirror representation of that
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.500]   on both sides of the brain
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.360]   and that most of that information
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.420]   is kept on one side of the brain or the other.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.080]   There isn't a lot of extensive intermixing
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.320]   at the first order of processing.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.760]   So the question I have is whether or not you believe,
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.840]   I'm not asking for data.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.280]   First, I just want to know what you believe,
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.560]   that this alternating nostril airflow phenomenon
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.640]   has anything to do with preferential processing
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.960]   of olfactory information in terms of right brain,
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.240]   left brain, with the caveat that
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.080]   anytime we hear right brain, left brain,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.780]   we've covered this in a previous episode,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.360]   most of what people hear out there
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.980]   about right brain, left brain,
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.000]   emotionality, logical stuff is completely wrong,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.280]   completely wrong, doesn't exist, is a total fabrication,
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.040]   and we'd like to abolish that myth.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.360]   But with that aside, or set aside rather,
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.840]   what are your thoughts on why the information
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.160]   would switch from one side of the brain
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.040]   to the other at all?
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   Yeah, I don't think that the nasal cycle
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.380]   is an olfaction story.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:54.080]   So I don't think that this was shaped
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.840]   by the olfactory system,
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.720]   nor do I think this has major impact on olfaction.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.140]   I think the nasal cycle story
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.240]   is a different story about brain function.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.480]   So we have this sort of pet theory
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.040]   where calling now the snipping brain approach,
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:20.040]   where basically we think that nasal inhalation
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:28.960]   is timing and driving a lot of aspects and patterns
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.920]   of neural activity and cognitive processing.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.400]   And this theory is olfaction inspired in its beginning.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.120]   That is, I mean, if you think of the mammalian brain,
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   right, which evolved from olfaction,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.200]   it's sitting there and in olfaction,
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.800]   because olfaction depends on sniffing,
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.000]   you have this situation where you have a sniff,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.360]   you have information, and then flat, nothing, right?
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.660]   And then you have information and then nothing.
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.160]   So information processing is one to one
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.280]   linked to nasal inhalation.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   And we think that this property evolved
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:15.160]   to be meaningful in brain processing in general,
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.140]   not only of olfactory information,
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.360]   but of any type of information,
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.160]   because the brain evolved in this way,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.140]   in this way that it processes information
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.240]   on inhalation onset.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.160]   So a study led by Ofer Perel from our lab
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.360]   two, three years ago,
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.960]   we looked at something completely non-olfactory.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.720]   We looked at visuospatial processing,
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.640]   and we compared visuospatial processing
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.280]   on inhalation versus exhalation.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.440]   And the brain does this completely different
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.760]   on inhalation versus exhalation.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.640]   In that particular task,
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.160]   people performed significantly better
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.860]   on inhalation versus exhalation.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.700]   - What was the task?
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.600]   Was it an olfactory task?
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.480]   - No, no, it's a visuospatial task.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.980]   So this is a task where the specifics of the task
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.060]   were that you see a shape,
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.380]   and you have to determine if it's a shape
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.740]   that can or cannot exist in the real world.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:11.260]   So some of them were these like,
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.840]   usher shapes like, you know,
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.980]   where one facet doesn't reach the other facet.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.460]   - The impossible figure type of stuff.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:21.080]   - Yeah, but structural shapes, not,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.660]   and so a pure visuospatial task,
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.500]   we intentionally went for a task
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:30.460]   that is not considered a ventral temporal task,
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.780]   olfactory cortex task in any way.
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.160]   And people performed much better
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.840]   on inhalation versus exhalation at doing this task.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.740]   - Was there a both nostrils occluded version
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.280]   where people were forced to mouth breathe?
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.580]   - Yes, and in this particular task,
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.120]   they also did better on mouth inhalation
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.760]   versus mouth exhalation.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.740]   But the difference wasn't as pronounced
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.780]   as it was with nasal inhalation versus exhalation.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.060]   So I'm a big proponent of nasal not mouth breathing
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.900]   whenever possible for many health-related reasons.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.920]   I'm a big fan of the book, "Jaws, a Hidden Epidemic,"
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.340]   written by colleagues of mine at Stanford.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:12.300]   - Familiar with it. - Yeah.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.620]   And this idea that people who mouth breathe
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.180]   experience more colds, more infections of various kinds.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:22.100]   It's not good aesthetically or for the dentature.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.500]   I never know, the teeth, the gums, it's stuff.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.620]   Sorry, my dentist is gonna come after me.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.860]   The other dentist anyway.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.640]   That nose breathing is great for your health
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.480]   relative to mouth breathing.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.900]   - So I think it's also good for your cognition,
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.900]   not only for your dental health.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.740]   I think that nose breathing shapes cognition.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:48.740]   And there are other labs who are finding the same.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:53.040]   Again, Cristina Zellano is doing work on this line.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.380]   She had major contributions here.
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.900]   And Johan Lundström is doing work on this line.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.220]   There's lots of studies suggesting
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:06.220]   that nasal inhalation is timing cognitive processing
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.660]   and modulating it.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.380]   - Incredible, perhaps not surprising
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.720]   given what you've taught us about the olfactory system.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.960]   I mean, these two holes in the front of our face,
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.700]   these nostrils, I mean, are a pathway to the brain, right?
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.820]   I love to tell people,
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.660]   'cause I work on the visual system in my lab,
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.580]   that your eyes are two pieces of brain
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.100]   extruded from the cranial vault, which they are,
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.820]   the retinas anyhow.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:35.600]   And then you never look at anyone the same way again.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.340]   But the olfactory sensory neurons
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.020]   are right there at the top.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.720]   So those caverns that we call nostrils and they are brain.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.780]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.800]   It's the only place where your brain meets the outside world
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.100]   because in your retina, they're protected by a lens.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:57.180]   And here you have neurons in contact with the world.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:01.220]   This actually has been the source for some theories
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:06.220]   on a potential route for neurodegenerative mechanisms.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:11.920]   So as you may know, loss of the sense of smell
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.800]   is one of the, if not the earliest sign
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.860]   of neurodegenerative disease.
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.060]   So for example, in Parkinson's disease,
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.260]   there's a loss in the sense of smell,
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.020]   probably 10 years before any other symptom.
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:29.620]   But people have failed to make this a diagnostic tool
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.620]   because it's nonspecific.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.580]   So it's not as if you could come to your doctor
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.820]   and say, I'm losing my sense of smell.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.180]   And they'll say, oh, early sign of Parkinson's
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.460]   because you can have many reasons
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.100]   to lose your sense of smell and so on.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:50.980]   But olfactory loss again is an early sign
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.260]   of neurodegeneration.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.620]   And there's at least one theory,
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.940]   particularly about Alzheimer's disease,
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.180]   suggesting that Alzheimer's may be the result
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.820]   of a pathogen that enters the brain
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.320]   through the olfactory system.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.660]   It's not, of course, a mainstream
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.700]   or widely accepted theory of any type,
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.580]   but it just highlights this notion
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:18.480]   that the nose is a path to our brain.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.460]   I think these non-invasive readouts
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.840]   of potential neurodegeneration,
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.440]   such as visual tests because of the fact
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.980]   that the retinas are part of the brain
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.500]   and loss of neurons in the retina
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.820]   is often associated with other forms
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.580]   of central degeneration, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, et cetera,
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.380]   as it's a little more invasive than what you're describing.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.140]   I'm beginning to wonder why we don't have
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.220]   a olfactory task every time we go to the doctor
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.860]   that would allow tracking over time
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.560]   because, of course, as you mentioned,
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.280]   someone can lose their sense of smell.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.400]   Does that mean they're getting Alzheimer's?
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.540]   Not necessarily, but if their sense of smell
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.080]   was terrific the year before
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.320]   and it's 50% worse the next year--
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   - That's a really bad sign.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.340]   - Yeah, that's a bad sign.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.180]   And so what we're talking about,
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.000]   something completely non-invasive
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.920]   and could be relatively pleasant to innocuous
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.900]   depending on the odors used.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.140]   - So yeah, so first I can answer that, right?
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.280]   And the reason that that's not happened,
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.260]   and that may be changing right now,
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.840]   but the reason that has not happened
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.960]   is because olfaction has not been effectively digitized.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.200]   Right, so if you need to generate
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.080]   really precise visual information,
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.760]   you can buy a monitor for 100 bucks
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.000]   that is at the resolution of the visual system basically.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.680]   And if you wanna generate auditory stimuli really precisely,
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.040]   then you can buy an amplifier
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.060]   for maybe a bit more than 100 bucks, but not that much more,
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:46.200]   and you'll be at the resolution of the auditory system.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.140]   In our lab, we build devices that generate odors,
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.300]   we call them olfactometers, which is a misnomer
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.700]   because they don't measure anything,
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.060]   but that's what they've always been called,
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.420]   so we call them olfactometers as well.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.640]   And we've already built at least one olfactometer
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.380]   that cost a quarter of a million euro, and it's pathetic.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:07.380]   Right, so it's pathetic, it's slow, it's contaminated,
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.280]   it's nowhere near the resolution of your system.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.620]   So one of the reasons that's not happened
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:17.440]   is just the utterly poor control of the stimulus.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.280]   Mind you, to some extent, it has happened
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.960]   in that there are standard clinical tests of olfaction,
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.220]   basically two that sort of control the world in this respect.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.580]   The older one is a test called the UPSIT,
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.820]   which stands for the University of Pennsylvania
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.140]   Smell Identification Test.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.820]   It was developed by Richard Doty in Penn,
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.540]   and it's a test where you scratch and sniff,
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.740]   and it's a four-alternative forced-choice test
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.700]   with 40 odorants.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.940]   So you have these 40 pages that you page through,
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:53.060]   and you sniff and smell, and it's been normed
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.920]   on gazillions of tests.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.660]   I'm always amused by it because,
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   so Richard Doty made a ton of money on the UPSIT,
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.020]   but he needed it because he has a habit.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.940]   He has a NASCAR.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:10.580]   So this, every time we buy UPSITs in the lab,
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.940]   I say there's another gallon of gas into Richard Doty.
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.460]   - He races NASCAR?
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.220]   - Not like NASCAR, but like one lower than that.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.980]   Like, I don't know, like some sort of Formula A
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.880]   or Formula Ford or some, he races a car.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.620]   And so that's where all the UPSITs went.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.820]   So I always feel good about buying UPSITs
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.340]   because I know they're going to that good cause.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.300]   - Keeping him in the fast lane.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.700]   - But so that's one test that's out there,
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.300]   and indeed, you know, has been shown as a,
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:40.260]   you know, so there's reduced UPSIT in Alzheimer's
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.420]   and Parkinson's and in a host of other diseases.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:47.300]   And there's a European version called sniffing sticks
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.420]   that Thomas Hummel has developed.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:54.420]   And it's basically the same sort of concept of this.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.980]   That one isn't scratch and sniff.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.660]   It's like these pens that you open up and sniff.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.140]   But those exist, but they're not as convenient
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:07.500]   as delivering stimuli and vision and audition.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.780]   And that's why you don't have what you've just suggested.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.620]   - Interesting.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.020]   - You know, another place where you don't have it,
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.940]   which I think is even more,
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.840]   would have been even more meaningful,
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.500]   is you don't, olfaction is not tested in newborns, right?
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.420]   Where vision and audition is.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.500]   You know, there's this thing called congenital anosmia,
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.280]   right, which is being without the sense of smell
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.520]   from birth, supposedly, congenital,
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.460]   which is a half a percent of the population.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.740]   - It's not a trivial number.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.300]   - Not totally, yeah.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.740]   But nobody knows if that really is true.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.060]   Because here's an amazing factoid.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:49.740]   Guess the average age at which congenital anosmia
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.580]   is diagnosed.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.380]   And this is a horrible statistic for me
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.940]   for the way I see the world.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.660]   But what do you think the average age of diagnosis is
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.020]   for congenital anosmia?
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.180]   - Five years of age.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.620]   - 14, incredible, 14.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.020]   So most people who are one half of a 1%
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.860]   of the human population, presumably,
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.780]   is without the sense of smell
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:13.700]   and doesn't realize that until they're 14 years old.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.620]   - Well, I don't know when they realized it first,
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:19.180]   but it's formally diagnosed at 14 on average,
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.020]   which means some of them even later, right?
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.260]   - And, right, it's a distribution.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:27.380]   What, do they suffer?
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:32.260]   - Yes, so first of all, they suffer socially.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:38.140]   And there's a host of deleterious life events
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.820]   associated with congenital anosmia.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.900]   They die younger.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:51.220]   So this is work out of Ilona Croix in Germany.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:56.580]   And amongst the various things that are predicted
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.740]   by anosmia is shorter lifespan.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:04.260]   But things like reduced social contacts,
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:09.260]   reduced romantic social contacts, it's not a good thing.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:14.740]   - And do they lack olfactory bulbs?
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.860]   I'm presuming they have noses and nostrils.
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.420]   There is a condition I'm aware of
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.580]   where children are born without noses or nostrils.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.140]   Very rare, very rare.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.780]   We won't focus on that because it's exceedingly rare.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:28.780]   - So they're born with noses and nostrils.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.620]   And here's the thing, right?
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.060]   They don't know if they're born with olfactory bulbs.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.540]   Most of them, although not all of them,
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.420]   but most of them don't have olfactory bulbs in adulthood.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.820]   Or I should rephrase that, have remnant olfactory bulbs,
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.100]   really shriveled olfactory bulbs.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.500]   But nobody can see the cause and effect here.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500]   - Before we talk about the role of,
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.540]   the requirement for olfactory bulbs for olfaction,
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.620]   a very interesting topic in its own right,
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.660]   I'm curious as to whether or not
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.420]   their endocrine system is altered.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.140]   Because as we'll soon talk about,
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.260]   there's a lot of signaling through the nose
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.780]   from between individuals that triggers things,
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.380]   everything from the onset of puberty
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.620]   to feelings of romantic attraction,
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.060]   attachment, these sorts of things.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.540]   Is it known whether or not,
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.940]   and I should say, excuse me for interrupting myself,
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.780]   but as long as I'm interrupting you every five minutes,
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.380]   I might as well interrupt myself too,
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.660]   that we are well aware of the proximity
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.580]   of the olfactory system to some of the hypothalamic systems
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.380]   that regulate the release of gonadotropins,
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.860]   which control testosterone and estrogen production, et cetera.
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:38.460]   So are they hormonally normal?
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.460]   - So some are and some aren't, and I'll be specific.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.900]   So there is a condition known as Kalman's syndrome,
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:51.220]   which is hypogonadic development in men.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:57.100]   And in Kalman's syndrome, they're practically all anosmic.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.420]   So to answer your question, yes, there's a direct link,
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.780]   and it materializes in Kalman's syndrome.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.620]   That said, not all congenitally anosmic individuals
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.700]   have Kalman's syndrome, and not all,
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.700]   but almost all people who have Kalman's syndrome
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.740]   are anosmic.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:19.740]   So Kalman's syndrome goes with anosmia.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.620]   I think, so there's a female equivalent of Kalman's,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.740]   or I don't remember its name.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.300]   - It's not in the Turner syndrome family.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.140]   - I'm not sure.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.820]   And I think it's also associated with anosmia,
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.500]   but I'm not confident of that.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   But Kalman's is associated with anosmia.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.740]   So the answer is yes.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   And we can maybe, olfaction and reproduction
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.740]   are tightly linked, and they're tightly linked
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.620]   in all mammals, and we are big terrestrial mammals,
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.420]   and olfaction and reproduction are linked in humans as well.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.380]   - Yeah, we will definitely get into that.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.980]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.800]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.100]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.760]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.340]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.900]   to help you better understand your body
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.780]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.080]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.040]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.380]   that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.520]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.240]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.360]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.980]   is that most of the time, it does not come back
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.580]   with any information about what to do
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.820]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.700]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.120]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.580]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.740]   becomes very straightforward
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.680]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.720]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.460]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.600]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.620]   that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.360]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.860]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called APOB,
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.020]   in their ultimate plan.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.660]   APOB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.420]   and therefore, there's extreme value
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.440]   to knowing your APOB levels.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.820]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.560]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.900]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:19.260]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:24.260]   I have a story/question that I'd like to tell you,
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.900]   ask you, as a segue to that.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.600]   Noting, of course, that we'll get back
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.940]   to the requirement for olfactory bulbs,
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.440]   yes or no for olfaction.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.180]   And this relates to when I was growing up,
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.380]   I grew up at the end of a street
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.180]   with a lot of boys of my age
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.540]   who, just by coincidence, had a lot of older sisters.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.220]   They were my sister, my older sister's age.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.800]   It was fortunate, so I had a lot of kids to play with.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.620]   We would hang out at each other's houses,
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:54.020]   bike, build jumps, and do all those things,
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.460]   like kid stuff, fort stuff,
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.200]   get into trouble or whatnot.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.100]   And oftentimes, we would end up leaving
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.100]   our articles of clothing at each other's houses
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.220]   all the time, like t-shirts and jackets.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.100]   And so, my mom was constantly coming in and saying,
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:13.140]   there's this clothes, like someone left us here,
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:13.980]   I don't know who it was.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.880]   We were all more or less the same size.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.480]   And from as far back as I could remember,
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.460]   six, seven years old and onward,
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.540]   I could pick up a shirt or a jacket, smell it,
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.420]   and say, oh, well, that's Eric Eisenhart's shirt,
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.940]   a friend of mine there, I just gave his name.
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.780]   Or, oh, that's Scott Madsen's shirt.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.820]   I could just smell the shirt and in a conscious way,
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.140]   know who it belonged to, having never, I promise,
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:42.020]   not that I would pretend if I had,
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.460]   pretend that I hadn't if I had,
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.140]   but having never actually done the exercise
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.100]   of going and taking and smelling my friend intentionally.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.060]   - Right. - Okay?
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.060]   In fact, if anything, I had all the reasons in the world
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.980]   to avoid smelling the other young boys in my neighborhood.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.140]   Okay, so that raises a question of whether or not
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.340]   we are consciously and/or subconsciously
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:06.900]   coding identification of people that we interact with
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.700]   frequently or infrequently in terms of their smell
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:15.140]   or some other aspect of their chemistry.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.580]   - Yeah.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.840]   So, yes.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.120]   We're doing that all the time, in my view,
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   and a lot of this processing, almost all of it,
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.820]   is subconscious, and I don't know why.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.920]   I already put that out there, right?
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.920]   I have no idea why human nature or culture or whatnot
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:46.120]   has pushed this into the realm of subconscious
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.980]   and something we're unaware of.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.680]   But we do it all the time,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.600]   and our lab has lots of studies on this front.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.680]   One of them you may be familiar with
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.560]   that had gained some notoriety because it's amusing.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:08.520]   So we look at human behavior a lot.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.980]   We try to look at it through our nose
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.380]   in the way we look at what people are doing.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   We try to think, if I was a dog, what would I think of this?
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:23.780]   And if you look at dogs, when they interact,
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.620]   they visibly sniff each other.
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.540]   It's very obvious.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:29.100]   They walk up to each other and they sniff each other.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.320]   And yet humans don't typically walk up to a stranger
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.680]   and carefully sniff them, right?
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.200]   I mean, we're sort of obliged to sniff our babies.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.680]   That's considered almost something you're supposed to do.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.360]   And it's not culturally taboo to sniff our loved ones.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.300]   It sort of doesn't seem like an odd thing to do.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.160]   But we don't sniff strangers, right?
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.260]   Well, or do we?
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:58.380]   So we're finding more and more mechanisms where we do this.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.540]   And the one I'm referring to now, for one example,
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.420]   is we started looking at handshaking.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.340]   Handshaking is this really odd behavior.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.900]   And it's not only in the West, by the way,
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.560]   as some people think it's only a Western thing.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.340]   It's not, it's almost everywhere.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:16.460]   And there's really poor understanding
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.860]   of how this behavior evolved.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.340]   Like where did this thing come from?
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:24.500]   So if you look for the Wikipedia version, right,
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.180]   then they'll tell you that it's to show
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.300]   that you're not holding a weapon in your hand.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.600]   But there's really no good evidence for that.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.780]   It's a bit like the trillion bloodhound receptor story,
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.620]   right, I mean, we tried to find it.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.420]   Why do people say that?
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.760]   They just do.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.060]   And we started looking at people handshaking.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.500]   And we noticed, or it seemed to us that we're noticing
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.220]   that people will shake hands and then go like this
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.040]   and like this.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.660]   - For those of you listening and not watching,
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.940]   Noam is taking his hand and wiping it on his face.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.380]   Or grabbing his nose or touching the side of his cheek.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.220]   - Yeah, these things that we do all the time.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.220]   - After a handshake.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.860]   - Well, so first of all, we do them all the time,
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:03.680]   just period, right?
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.860]   The baseline here is really high,
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:05.820]   and we'll get to that in a second.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:10.820]   But these behaviors that you could easily not notice, right?
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:14.300]   And so we asked whether that's a real thing.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.700]   And this was a study led by Yidan Froomin
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.940]   in our lab at the time.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:24.880]   And what we did first, and if you want,
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.580]   we can link, so this was published in eLife.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:28.940]   And one of the nice things about eLife
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:32.320]   is that it has a very effective way to embed videos
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   in the publication.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.220]   So if you want, we can link this to your system later on.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.980]   - We'll put it in the show note captions
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:41.380]   as a link on YouTube and the other four platforms,
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.360]   Spotify, Apple.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:47.280]   - So what we did is we brought in participants to our lab,
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.180]   and we sat them in the room, experiment room,
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.260]   and told them the experiment would start soon
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.260]   and they should wait for us there.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.220]   They didn't know what they were coming from.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.840]   Unbeknownst to them, they were already being videoed.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.620]   Of course, later on, they had the opportunity
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.260]   to not agree to us saving the video,
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.860]   in which case we would delete it immediately
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.860]   or letting us use it for science
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.740]   or some letting us use it for more than science
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.060]   for the video that's now on eLife.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.840]   And we walk into the room and say,
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.340]   "Okay, just wait here.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.060]   "We'll be right back with you to set up our experiment."
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.180]   And they would sit there for three minutes.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.620]   And during those three minutes,
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.020]   we could later quantify how much indeed they,
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.180]   just by baseline, how much they touch their nose
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.300]   or their forehead or their chin
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.940]   or how many times their hand reaches their face.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.220]   And by the way, that baseline is not low, okay?
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.500]   And then three minutes later,
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.340]   an experimenter would walk into the room
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:44.900]   and would share a consistent text.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.160]   It would be, "We're still setting up our equipment
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.100]   "in the other room, and so just wait here
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.200]   "and we'll be right back with you.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.380]   "But in the meantime, just wait here."
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.500]   And the experimenter went through this
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.060]   like 20-second fixed text.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.260]   And in half of the cases, it included a handshake.
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.300]   This was a new experimenter,
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.460]   not the one who put them in the room.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.020]   So it's the first time they met.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.700]   So it'd be, "Hello, I'm so-and-so."
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.660]   They would put out their hand
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.900]   and shake their hand or not, okay?
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:12.540]   And we did all possible interactions in terms of gender.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.940]   So we matched male participants
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.220]   with male and female experimenters
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.140]   and female participants with female and male experimenters.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.860]   And so you had handshake and no handshake conditions.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:24.020]   And then you can quantify that behavior
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.740]   of the hand going to the nose after handshake.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.940]   And there was a remarkable increase
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.920]   in the hand going to the nose after handshake.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.560]   And this is one of the nice cases.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.000]   The paper includes statistics,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.440]   but you don't need statistics here.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.500]   Just look at the video.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.020]   It's unreal.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.140]   The video is unreal.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:42.980]   - So interesting.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.180]   - So the hand goes to the nose.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.740]   Now, we did a few controls here
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.740]   to verify that this is an olfactory behavior.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:50.660]   One is, unbeknownst to participants,
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.420]   we measured nasal airflow.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.780]   And people not only bring their hand to their nose,
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:55.660]   they sniff it.
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.040]   So, and this is perfectly timed.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.660]   They go like this, okay?
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.300]   So they're sniffing their hand.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.940]   And in an additional control study, we manipulated it.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.060]   So we built this little James Bond thing
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.620]   of a watch on the experimenter's hand
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.980]   that could emit an odor.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.060]   And the experimenter didn't know
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.900]   what odor they were emitting.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.760]   And they could emit either a pleasant or an unpleasant odor.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.140]   And we could drive the self-sampling afterwards up or down.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.020]   So this was an olfactory behavior.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.860]   No doubt about it.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.060]   I mean, we're quite confident.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.380]   - So people, in that case,
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.740]   people must have been sensing the odor on their own hand
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:30.540]   because they shook the hand of the experimenter,
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.460]   pleasant odor,
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.700]   and they're more frequently bringing that hand to their nose
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.500]   versus unpleasant odor that had been introduced
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.380]   to their own hand by the experimenter, correct?
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:41.020]   - Yeah, but no, I think they were sensing
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.540]   the ambient odor that came in with the hand that shook.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.920]   And then that either drove them
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.700]   to sniff their hand more or less.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.540]   - The odor cloud of the experimenter.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.060]   - Yeah, and there's an interesting thing going on here, too,
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.700]   because people didn't only smell the hand that shook.
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.060]   They also smelled the other hand.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.500]   And we think that there's something going on here
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.860]   comparing self to other.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:07.380]   And we think a lot of self-sampling might reflect that.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.180]   There's, on the same line,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.060]   and again, to link to your childhood story
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.720]   of identifying your friends by smell,
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.120]   a study we published just last year by Inbal Ravrebi
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.120]   in our lab where Inbal came with this basic interest
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.680]   in this phenomenon that's loosely referred to
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.340]   as click friendships.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.900]   So people you meet and you click right away, right?
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.540]   You immediately become close friends.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.660]   And this is a phenomenon that is poorly described
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.260]   or is poorly described in literature as an entity,
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.300]   and yet anybody will tell you
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.480]   they know what you're talking about, right?
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.920]   I mean, if somebody you click with right away,
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.960]   you become intimate within five minutes, right?
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.340]   Everybody experienced this in their life to some extent.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.820]   And the question is, what was there, right?
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.660]   What was it?
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.640]   Was it because you looked the same, could be?
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.820]   Was it because you had the same sports team that you liked?
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:11.960]   Or is there something deeper here?
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   And Inbal's theory was that a similarity in body order
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:23.180]   may contribute to this, that people who smell the same
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.900]   will click in some way.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.460]   And so to address that, she actually recruited
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.900]   click friends from all over Israel.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.660]   She posted all over social media
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:37.660]   to identify pairs of friends.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.420]   So these are same-sex, non-romantic dyads.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.560]   So these are friends, men and women,
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.120]   whose friendship started as a clique,
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.120]   where here this becomes sensitive
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.140]   because it has to be a mutual clique, right?
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.720]   Later on, we discovered there could be one-sided cliques.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.820]   So somebody who's sure they clicked with somebody else,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:55.900]   but the other person.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.400]   - There's a name for that in neurology
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.020]   that our common friend, the late Ben Barres taught me,
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.460]   which is there's a phrase that neurologists use
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.740]   called sticky.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.900]   These are people that come up to you
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.180]   and start asking you questions
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.640]   and then won't leave you alone.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.880]   They're so-called sticky people.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.940]   And if you ask these sticky people,
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:17.000]   sticky in air quotes, 'cause they're not physically sticky.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.180]   - They may be.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.020]   - They could be.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:23.380]   What do you think of this person?
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.220]   They'll say, "Oh, they're great.
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.800]   "We're really good friends."
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.520]   And so they've made a unilateral clique friendship.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.040]   And yes, neurologists are talking about you.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.300]   If you're one of these people,
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.420]   neurologists are talking about you,
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.320]   there's an informal diagnostic code, sticky.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.160]   So she recruited clique friends
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:50.080]   and then she sampled their body odor.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.060]   And we have a protocol for this.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.860]   So they're given odorless shampoo and soap
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.840]   to use for three weeks or something.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.700]   And then they sleep two nights in this t-shirt
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.020]   where they have to sleep alone.
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.900]   And then we extract the body odor from the t-shirt.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.700]   And so we have a way to extract,
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.980]   a method to extract body odor.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   And then she first asked whether indeed
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.480]   clique friends are more similar in their body odor
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.520]   than you would expect by chance.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.260]   And she first tested this with a device,
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.540]   a machine we call an electronic nose.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:27.120]   So an electronic nose is sort of a very poor effort
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.800]   to mimic what the mammalian nose does.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.260]   Basically, it's a bunch of sensors
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:31.740]   that respond to airborne molecules.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.180]   In this case, sensors referred to as moxers,
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:36.620]   as metal oxide covered sensors.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.340]   And so she used an electronic nose
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.140]   to sample these body odors.
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.260]   And she found that clique friends are indeed
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.300]   more similar to each other than you would expect by chance,
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.300]   by random dyads.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.740]   And this was a significant difference.
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.540]   And after she found that a device could do this,
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.100]   she had other participants do this.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.740]   So she had people smelling the clique friends
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.140]   versus non-clique friends.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.500]   And they judged them as being more similar
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.140]   to each other than not.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.420]   Now again, you might wonder, is this causal or not right?
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.720]   Because maybe clique friends go to the same restaurant
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.220]   together all the time or whatever,
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.220]   live in the same neighborhood,
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.780]   and that's why they smell the same.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:23.540]   So to address causality, she recruited total strangers
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:27.100]   and first smelled them with the electronic nose,
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.620]   and then engaged them in a social interaction,
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.380]   something called the mirror game.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:34.040]   So in the mirror game, one person moves their hands
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.860]   and the other person is really close to them,
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.620]   like right here, so they can smell each other
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:42.100]   and has to move their hands with the other person.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.360]   And one prediction there panned out, but another didn't.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.440]   The one that didn't, so she predicted that people
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.240]   who would smell more similar to each other
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.900]   would be better at the mirror game.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.980]   That is, they would follow each other better.
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.720]   That did not pan out.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.420]   However, she then also had,
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.220]   the interaction was completely nonverbal.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.620]   They were not allowed to speak with each other,
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:04.240]   and she did an entire round robin,
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.700]   so everybody played with everybody else.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.380]   This was an insane experiment to run.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:11.820]   And she then, at the end of the experiment,
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:14.080]   each person rated each other person
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.780]   as to how much they think they would wanna be their friends,
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.100]   and also on a bunch of ratings,
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.340]   how nice they think they are,
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:22.620]   how affectionate they think, a bunch of ratings, okay?
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.060]   All of this was predicted by the electronic nose.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:28.300]   So people who smell more similar to each other
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.520]   think that the other person is more likely
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.500]   to be their friend, is more likely to be a nice person,
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.340]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.340]   So we could actually predict friendship
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.840]   using the electronic nose.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.980]   So this is not a result of friendship.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:45.700]   It plays into the causal elements of building friendship.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.720]   So this is to relate to your childhood story.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.180]   There's something going on here.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.620]   We're constantly smelling ourselves, constantly.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.900]   This constantly, I mean, if you wanna look,
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.140]   the reason I'm smiling, I mean,
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.480]   and your viewers or listeners will understand
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.000]   why I'm smiling, I'll send you a video to link
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.100]   into your podcast here.
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.120]   We thought of calling,
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.220]   the fact that people constantly sniff themselves,
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.120]   we thought of calling this the Lowe effect.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.260]   And Lowe, so in America, this won't pass that effectively,
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:21.400]   but in the rest of the normal world,
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.520]   Joachim Lowe is the national soccer coach
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.420]   of the German soccer team.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.960]   So, I mean, I don't know who would be a very famous coach
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.260]   here, but Steve Kerr.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:37.260]   I mean, this is a super, super famous name
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.960]   all around the world where soccer is the primary sport
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.900]   that people watch.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.860]   And once people will see this video,
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.180]   they'll understand why we thought of calling this
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.880]   the Lowe effect.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.720]   It's very graphic.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.660]   But people are constantly smelling themselves.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.900]   They're smelling themselves with their hands.
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.160]   They're smelling themselves explicitly.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.760]   People are constantly smelling themselves,
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.200]   constantly smelling others.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.340]   - I find this topic so interesting.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.020]   And first of all, confession,
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.800]   I definitely smell myself multiple times per day.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800]   - Everybody does.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.640]   - Okay, good.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.560]   And I would do it anyway.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.500]   I think I, like most people,
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.680]   I either find my own smell to be neutral to pleasant.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.860]   Occasionally I'll be like, whoa, I need to take a shower.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.380]   As long as we're talking about smelling oneself
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.620]   and friendship, kinship, and its relationship to smell,
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.780]   we have to talk about the relationship between smell
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.780]   and romantic attraction and bond.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.740]   So my understanding is that if, for instance,
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.900]   a mouse is given the option to mate
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.240]   with any number of other different mice,
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.820]   they will bias their choice toward the mouse
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.220]   that has the immune composition, the so-called MHC,
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.860]   major histocompatibility complex,
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.100]   which reflects immune diversity,
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.460]   the immune system that is most distant from theirs.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.960]   And the evolutionary argument being
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.780]   that were they to produce offspring,
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.540]   that the array of immune genes would be much broader
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.420]   than if they were to select an animal very close to them.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:11.140]   And in addition to that,
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:15.540]   that one of the most strongly selected against behaviors,
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:16.860]   not just culturally,
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:21.740]   but at the level of eliciting a sense of disgust,
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:24.780]   maybe even from the activity of the hypothalamus,
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:27.980]   is mating with very close kin, AKA incest,
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.860]   because that can potentially,
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.780]   we know produces a higher rate of mutations.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.780]   In other words,
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.780]   whereas you've described the relationship
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.260]   between smell and choice of friends
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:39.660]   as you choose people who smell more like you,
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.380]   my understanding is that in the context
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:46.380]   of choosing romantic partners or sexual partners or both,
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:50.700]   that you choose the person who's odor
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.660]   and therefore immune composition is most different.
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.500]   - Right.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.420]   So the way you describe the animal literature is correct.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.300]   And there's evidence to similar mechanisms in humans.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:05.100]   Our lab has not worked directly on this issue
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:10.100]   of romantic selection based on odor.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.860]   There's a bunch of papers,
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:17.780]   Wedkind et al. and the Wedkind lab,
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.160]   and also Porter.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.180]   I'll email these to you later on,
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:24.220]   that have done a lot of this work
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.240]   and find exactly as you say
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.380]   that romantic odor preferences in humans
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.740]   are influenced by body odor,
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:36.020]   and that this is linked to MHC,
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:40.420]   histocompatibility, complex makeup of the portion
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:44.500]   of our genome that shapes our immune system to some extent.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:48.460]   So this effect has been studied
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:50.460]   and reported on again extensively in mice
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.460]   and also in humans, not work that we've done.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:03.000]   The one sort of tangent work we've done
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   and I'd like to maybe tell you about,
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.400]   it relates to an effect that is one
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.080]   of the most remarkable effects
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.620]   in mammalian social chemo signaling.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.860]   So, and also related to,
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.240]   so it's not related to romanticism in any way,
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.880]   but it's related to reproduction.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.660]   And indeed in our lab, we've not looked at romanticism,
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:32.740]   we have looked at or are looking at reproduction.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.780]   They're not always the same.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.620]   - Certainly.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.060]   - They can.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:41.760]   Animal mammalian or terrestrial mammalian
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.020]   reproductive behavior is dominated
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.860]   by the sense of smell in mammals.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.820]   And here, remember initially when you started off,
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.200]   I noted that there are several subsystems in our nose
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.460]   that transduce odorants,
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.780]   and so primarily the main olfactory system,
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.660]   which is cranial nerve number one,
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.260]   and the trigeminal nerve, which is cranial number five.
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.100]   Most terrestrial mammals have another subsystem
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:10.180]   referred to as the secondary olfactory system
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:13.740]   that has a separate sense organ in the nose.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.340]   This organ is known as the vomeronasal organ.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.740]   It's a small pit in the nasal passage
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.500]   of most terrestrial mammals.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.780]   Sometimes it's described as a communicating pit
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.980]   because sometimes it connects the nasal passage
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.060]   to the roof of the mouth.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.700]   Sometimes it connects both.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.540]   And so there's the sense organ
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.460]   with its specific receptor subtypes,
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:39.260]   VNRs, vomeronasal receptors.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:44.260]   And this is linked to a sort of separate portion
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:49.100]   of the olfactory bulb,
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.220]   not really the main olfactory bulb,
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.920]   but what's referred to as the accessory olfactory bulb.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.940]   And from there directly to the limbic system,
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.060]   to the portions of the brain
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:03.060]   that control reproductive behavior and aggressive behavior.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:08.220]   And in most terrestrial mammals,
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.900]   this subsystem processes odorants
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.900]   that are sometimes referred to as pheromones,
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.540]   although that's in many ways a problematic term,
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.740]   but odorants that are referred to as pheromones,
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.140]   namely odorants that are emitted
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.060]   by another member of the species
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.500]   to influence that member of the species
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.540]   and alter behavior or hormonal state.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:31.300]   And some of these pheromonal effects
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.560]   are utterly remarkable.
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.580]   And in my view, the most remarkable of all
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:38.300]   is an effect known as the Bruce effect.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:42.140]   This was an effect discovered by Margaret Bruce in 1959.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:46.060]   She was a British scientist.
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.320]   And in the Bruce effect,
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.180]   when you expose a pregnant mouse
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:55.440]   at an early critical stage of the pregnancy,
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.740]   I think up to about day three,
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.780]   if you expose the pregnant mouse
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.640]   to the odor of what is referred to in technical terms
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.020]   as the non stud male,
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:08.780]   that is a male who did not father the pregnancy,
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.420]   she will miscarry the pregnancy.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.960]   She will abort it.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.420]   Now that's an insane decision made by the female here,
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:18.020]   because she's invested quite a lot in this,
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.900]   in biological terms and in forming this pregnancy
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.220]   and maintaining it.
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:26.100]   And yet she drops it on the basis of an odor.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:31.300]   And this effect is remarkably robust.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.180]   And what do I mean by remarkably robust?
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:37.620]   So this will occur on about 80% of exposures.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.180]   Now as you know, 80% is 100% in biology, right?
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:43.060]   I mean, there's nothing that happens at more than 80%.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:47.900]   So it's a remarkably robust effect,
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.780]   this dropping of the pregnancy.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.960]   - And we know it's mediated by chemo sensation
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.340]   through the nose. - We know for sure.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:55.580]   And we know in the following way.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:58.580]   So first, it's enough to just bring the odor
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.260]   of the non stud male.
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.640]   You don't have to bring the male himself, right?
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.260]   So you just can bring bedding from a non stud male
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.300]   and that will induce the Bruce effect.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.660]   But of course, the most telling set of experiments
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.900]   is that if in the female mouse,
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.700]   you ablate the vomeronasal organ,
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:18.140]   you just burn this tiny structure in the nose,
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.720]   then the effect disappears.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.540]   So the effect is completely dependent
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.980]   on the vomeronasal organ.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.580]   And I find this utterly a remarkable effect, right?
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:31.900]   I mean, again, because of the extent
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:36.180]   of cost that the female takes on here,
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.120]   based on this information and smell.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:44.120]   Now, humans, the sort of the going notion
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.840]   in olfaction is that humans don't have
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.880]   a functional vomeronasal organ.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.580]   So we don't have that functional organ in our nose.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:56.760]   Now, I'll point out, we actually do have the pit.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:02.260]   So the structure or the outlining structure is there.
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:06.480]   But the pit that we have is considered vestigial
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.760]   and non-functional.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.600]   - And what about this thing I learned about at Berkeley
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.880]   in integrative biology class
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.920]   that we have something called Jacobson's organ?
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.140]   - This is the same organ.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:21.200]   So Jacobson's organ is the vomeronasal organ.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:26.940]   It's also called Jacobson because I think Jacobson
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:31.660]   was a military physician in like the 1800s in Holland
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.720]   or something, and he found it in a soldier
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.640]   he was operating on or something like that.
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.440]   The story comes from something like that.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.800]   But Jacobson's organ is another name
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.980]   for the vomeronasal organ.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.420]   These are one and the same.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.900]   The sensory organ of the accessory olfactory system.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:52.940]   And again, the going notion is that the human Jacobson organ
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.780]   or vomeronasal organ is vestigial, it's non-functional.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.000]   - Does that necessarily mean
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.840]   that we don't have these pheromone effects?
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.760]   - No, it does not.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.740]   So first of all, we know that lots of what are considered
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:06.600]   pheromonal effects, namely social chemosignal and rodents
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.260]   are mediated by the main olfactory system.
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.360]   We know that for sure.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.920]   There are several examples for this in mice and rats
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.080]   and rabbits and so on and so forth.
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:19.720]   So A, these can be mediated by the main olfactory system.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.600]   And I'll come back to that in a second.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.460]   But first to finish the Bruce effect.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:29.460]   And second, and I'm going out on a limb here,
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:34.820]   but I'm willing to take that risk.
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:39.920]   For me, the jury is still out on human vomeronasal organ.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:46.900]   The decision or the notion that it's non-functional
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:52.420]   relies on about one and a half papers, post-mortem,
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.560]   looking for the nerve that connects this thing to the brain
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:58.180]   and failing to find it using staining
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.020]   and so on and so forth.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.300]   But staining post-mortem studies in humans
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:05.080]   are notoriously complicated.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.140]   Basically, for many reasons,
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:10.540]   one of them is that the material is just always,
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:15.460]   has gone through, it's not ideally set as it is
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:20.340]   when you sacrifice an animal and study its tissue.
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:26.420]   So based on really, really a paucity of studies
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:30.520]   that failed to find this nerve,
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.720]   the notion is that the structure is vestigial in humans.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.420]   I don't have any evidence that it's functional, mind you,
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.940]   but I'm just not sure that it's not.
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:45.940]   But what we do have a suspicion is that humans
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:52.140]   may experience something similar to Bruce effect.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:57.460]   So first of all, humans have an enormous number
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:02.180]   or ratio of spontaneous miscarriage.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.620]   - Are they occurring more often in the first trimester?
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.660]   Because you mentioned that in the Bruce effect
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.420]   in the mice is in the first three days or so
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:12.160]   following pregnancy, which in the mouse gestation,
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.080]   as I recall, is about 21 days in the mouse.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.000]   So you're talking about 1/7 of total gestation.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.320]   So I'm not quick enough to,
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.720]   nor is it important to translate,
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.960]   but this will be first trimester.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.920]   - Yes, which is indeed when most miscarriage occurs.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.600]   Now humans have, again, a huge number of miscarriages
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.180]   and the numbers, I'll soon share them with you,
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.160]   they sound odd.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.640]   And the reason they sound odd is because if you have
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.000]   what's sometimes simply referred to as failed implantation,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.520]   this can occur in days one, two, nobody ever knows.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.520]   So some papers talk about 90% of all human pregnancies
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.160]   end in miscarriage.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.720]   This is counting a failed implantation
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.280]   in day one, two, et cetera.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.640]   More conservative studies talk about 50%.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.920]   Nobody will argue 30%, okay?
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.920]   So a huge number, a huge number of human pregnancies
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.780]   end in miscarriage.
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:12.780]   Now out of these, there's a portion that are unexplained.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.280]   So nobody knows why.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.720]   I mean, there are a portion that are explained
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.400]   by all sorts of genetic factors, developmental factors,
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.800]   and so on and so forth.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.100]   But there's also a proportion that are unexplained.
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:29.100]   And so all I'm saying is that there's a statistical backdrop
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.440]   or setting, if you will,
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.920]   for something like a remnant bruce effect in humans.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.740]   Now with that in mind, we approached a group of,
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.880]   we enlisted a group of, they're not really patients
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.160]   and participants in a study of people who,
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.560]   couples who are experiencing what is referred to
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.760]   as unexplained repeated pregnancy loss.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:58.360]   So formally, if you have two consecutive
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.440]   unexplained miscarriages,
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.360]   then that is sufficient for the diagnosis
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.000]   of unexplained repeated pregnancy loss.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.040]   However, in our cohort of 30,
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.200]   we had couples who experienced 12 consecutive
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.280]   unexplained repeated pregnancy losses.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.840]   So the two is just the formal.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.240]   All of our cohort was like 12, five.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.280]   So this is an emotional, difficult place to be.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.680]   And these are couples who are losing their pregnancy
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.760]   for no apparent reason.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.400]   So they've gone through all the tests that you can imagine
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:37.260]   of genetic incompatibilities and all sorts of issues,
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:41.820]   clotting, all the known suspects for pregnancy loss.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.660]   And the medical establishment remains totally at a loss
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.200]   as to why these pregnancies aren't holding.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.200]   And so we hypothesized that perhaps here
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.380]   there's something akin to a bruce type effect.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.340]   Obviously it's not gonna be the same as in mice,
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.720]   but something like a bruce effect.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.480]   Now, of course, at that stage,
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:04.960]   we could not do anything causal to test this, right?
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.920]   But what we could do is to seek circumstantial evidence
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:13.380]   to see if where there's fire, maybe there's smoke.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:17.740]   And what we did was we tested olfaction
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:22.140]   and more specifically the response to male body odor
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:28.280]   in the couples experiencing repeated pregnancy loss.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:34.660]   And we found a few things.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.740]   First of all, if you think of the mechanisms
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:41.980]   behind the bruce effect, the bruce effect implies
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:45.420]   that the female has to have a very clear memory
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:49.780]   of the fathering male, because if she's gonna miscarry
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.140]   in response to the non-father,
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.140]   she has to know father, non-father.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:58.140]   I mean, that means that there's a pronounced olfactory memory
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:01.500]   at the moment of mating, okay?
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.460]   And in mice, this has been very well characterized
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.300]   and attributed to the anterior olfactory nucleus,
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.680]   a structure in the brain.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.680]   But you'd have to have this memory
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.220]   in order to make that decision.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.500]   Now, so to address that, and here you're gonna see
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.580]   that you and your childhood story from before
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:24.220]   stand out a bit as skillful,
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:28.780]   is that the first thing we did was just behaviorally test
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:34.700]   whether these women and control women
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:39.360]   could identify the smell of their spouse.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:44.460]   And you might be disappointed,
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:47.860]   or we would all are probably a bit disappointed
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.620]   to learn that control women are very poor at this.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:55.620]   So you would think that women would be good
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:58.260]   at identifying the body odor of their spouse.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:02.100]   They're not, they're not far from chance.
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:08.300]   However, the women who experience repeated pregnancy loss
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:14.620]   are more, they're double at their performance level.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.300]   So this is not a nuanced effect.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:21.620]   Women who experience repeated pregnancy loss
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:25.980]   can identify their husbands or their spouses
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:27.700]   by their body odor.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.060]   - With much greater acuity than the typical person?
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:34.180]   - Double, a bit more than double, and way above chance.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.260]   - Yeah, no, sorry, I posed it as a question,
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:39.580]   but I meant, yes, with much greater acuity,
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:43.160]   and double is a significant improvement.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.380]   Are they much better at detecting any odor?
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.220]   - No, they're not.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:50.060]   We did the controls, and they're not.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.120]   And then we also measured, using fMRI,
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:59.120]   we measured their brain response to stranger male body odor.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.700]   And this was quite remarkable because we approached,
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.260]   so this was a full brain analysis,
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:08.900]   without a region of interest analysis.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.220]   So it's not as if you're tweaking your statistics
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:13.720]   to look at one part of the brain.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.800]   You're just looking at the entire brain
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.520]   in the response to male body odor and asking de novo,
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.460]   is there a difference between
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.380]   these two groups of participants?
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.620]   And there was one huge difference,
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.500]   and it was in the hypothalamus.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.920]   And so there was a difference in response
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:30.300]   to stranger male body odor between the two groups.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:37.180]   So olfaction is altered in spontaneous,
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:40.320]   repeated spontaneous pregnancy loss.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.920]   We don't know this is causal, right?
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:47.220]   But that was enough for us to approach the ethics committee
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:50.180]   to run a causal experiment.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.260]   And we're at the beginning of that now.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:56.620]   - Incredible, I can't wait to hear the results of that.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:00.340]   - It's gonna take, it'll probably take years, a few.
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:05.340]   Because these are slow experiments to run.
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.740]   Recruitment is complicated.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:12.700]   But basically we're blocking smell in couples
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:19.100]   who are trying to maintain a pregnancy.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.680]   - I want to touch on some other so-called pheromone effects.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.160]   And one thing I heard you say during a talk,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.260]   which I think really captures this whole issue of,
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.800]   are there pheromone effects in humans?
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.040]   Very nicely, as you said,
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.140]   whether or not it's a classic pheromone effect
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:36.400]   or whether or not it's olfaction or something else,
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.440]   this is chemosensory signaling between individuals.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.680]   The reason this is important to me is a few years ago,
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.120]   I did a social media post about pheromone effects in animals
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.240]   and some potential pheromone effects in humans.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:52.240]   And then a couple of the human olfactionistas,
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.040]   more from the, actually who work on animal models,
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.860]   really came after me with intense sniffing,
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:03.680]   saying there is no evidence for human pheromone effects,
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.560]   human pheromone organs.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.120]   And I think today you've beautifully illustrated
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.480]   how regardless of the answer to that,
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.040]   humans contain and are emitting chemical signals
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.480]   that influence each other's physiology and behavior.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.720]   - For sure, for sure.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:20.560]   And the term pheromone is a problematic term in any case.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.220]   I mean, the term was put forth
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.520]   to describe insect behavior, right?
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.480]   So if you were given a hard time by the mouse people,
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:32.240]   you could have given them an equally hard time
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.600]   if you were an insect person, right?
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.600]   Because really the place the term is accurate is,
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.920]   so the first pheromone that was discovered was bambical,
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.000]   which is the pheromone that has the male moth
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.480]   follow the scent trail of the female moth.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.720]   Bambical is a pheromone.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.520]   Insect pheromone people will argue that this stuff
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.720]   that people talk about in mice and rats is not pheromones.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.880]   And it all becomes semantics.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.880]   - Yeah, sort of like nerdy inside ball.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.040]   - It's all semantics.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.960]   So in our publications, we don't use the term pheromone
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.100]   because it would not help me
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.200]   and it would probably only hurt us.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.600]   And so we talk about chemosignals
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.320]   and humans definitely emit chemosignals from their body.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.640]   And these chemosignals influence other humans
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.440]   and influence their behavior.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.000]   There are several examples of this.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.160]   One of them I'll point out first,
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:33.640]   which is sort of the most widely studied
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.760]   and not mostly from our lab actually.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.040]   I mean, the flavor of the month for the past 10 years
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.920]   in this field is what's referred to as the smell of fear.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:47.920]   Right, so this is probably true of many mammals and humans.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.620]   It's true of we emit a specific body odor
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.800]   when we're in a state of fear.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.160]   This was first discovered in humans by Denise Chen
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:02.720]   out of I think Brown, I'm not sure.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.000]   - I think that's right, yep.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.160]   - Humans emit a particular body odor
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.820]   when they're in a state of fear
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:10.640]   and this body odor influences other humans,
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:15.440]   in effect increasing their autonomic arousal,
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:16.880]   their sympathetic state.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.600]   So in effect, you could say that fear is contagious a bit.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.100]   So the smell of fear is contagious.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:27.280]   By the way, culturally, we know for ages
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.640]   that dogs can smell fear in humans,
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.520]   but actually that was only really shown
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.800]   about a year and a half ago in a study.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.560]   So it was always said,
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.120]   but it wasn't really shown effectively.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.040]   It was shown about a year and a half ago in a study
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.600]   that dogs indeed can smell human fear
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.460]   and humans can smell human fear.
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.260]   So several labs starting from Denise Chen
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:51.360]   and Haviland Jones and then in our lab and in other labs,
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.480]   if you collect body odor from people in a state of fear
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.520]   and collect body odor from the same people
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:59.300]   when they're not in a state of fear,
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:02.600]   other people can determine which is the state of fear or not
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.940]   and this influences their behavior.
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.300]   - What about the smell of safety
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.460]   or is that simply the absence of the odor
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:09.520]   corresponding to fear?
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.580]   And the reason I asked this is somewhat woven
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:16.360]   into our prior discussion about mate choice.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.880]   Again, I'll ask the question in a form of brief anecdotes.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.900]   I'll use the I had a friend who approach here,
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.140]   but well, one phenomenon that has nothing to do
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.620]   with me in particular, I think this is a common phenomenon,
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:33.620]   is romantic partners leaving articles of clothing
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.780]   at each other's homes.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.660]   Now this could have other purposes to mark territory,
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.340]   but visually marking territory,
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:43.460]   but also scent marking territory is very common
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.180]   in the animal kingdom.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:49.180]   It's not uncommon for romantic partners
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:52.260]   when one is traveling or away for the other partner
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:53.760]   to smell their article of clothing
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.700]   in order to bring about positive connotations
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.580]   of the other partner, very common behavior.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:00.140]   If you're doing this, folks,
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.340]   other people are doing this too.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:03.700]   It raises questions, for instance,
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:06.780]   about whether or not the mourning period post breakup,
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.540]   whether by decision by death
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:12.540]   or by some other phenomenon that's forced the breakup,
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:14.540]   whether or not that mourning period has something to do
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:18.020]   with an olfactory unlearning of,
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:20.260]   and mate selection and on and on and on.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.220]   - With all these insights,
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.660]   I would offer you to be a postdoc.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.000]   - Well, I was gonna say, listen,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.420]   I have a sabbatical coming up,
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.260]   so I would love to do a sabbatical.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.500]   - But it's gonna kill me.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.640]   - No, exactly, you don't want me to work for you.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.780]   We talked about this earlier for other reasons, exactly.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   There's a story there, what Noam is referring to.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.620]   I'll just tell people 'cause inside jokes on the podcast
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:38.900]   that don't really work.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.420]   Earlier, I was referring to the fact
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:43.580]   that I've had three incredible scientific mentors,
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.340]   undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc,
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:49.260]   but for reasons that are unclear to me,
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:52.140]   the first one died of suicide,
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:53.420]   the second one cancer at 50,
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:56.680]   and the third one pancreatic cancer in his early 60s,
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:58.260]   and the last one before he died,
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.980]   who was an MD and a common friend of Noam's,
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:03.180]   and I turned to me and said, Andrew,
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.500]   you're the common denominator,
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:08.220]   so the joke in my business is you don't want me
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:09.980]   to work for you, so nonetheless,
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:12.020]   I would love to do a sabbatical in your lab.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.540]   - So what I was trying to say in that roundabout way
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:17.380]   is that those are all really keen observations
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:19.880]   and good ideas, for sure,
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.340]   and they just highlight, again,
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.580]   that we're incredibly olfactory animals,
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.900]   and you're even talking about the nuance.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.820]   We're very olfactory even not in the nuance.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.860]   I mean, I have this, when people tell me
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.660]   that we don't use our sense of smell
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:35.980]   and we don't need it and all that,
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:37.740]   and I have to deal with this a lot, right?
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.860]   I have to deal a lot.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:40.260]   You study vision, nobody will tell you
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.620]   that vision is unimportant, right?
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:42.740]   - We're very visually dependent.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.380]   I don't need a dog to take over my olfactory system
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:47.100]   if I lose olfaction, but I'll tell you,
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.360]   from having lost my sense of smell for one day,
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.620]   I was in intense fear.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.420]   I bit into blueberries, I love blueberries.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:55.780]   I'm like a drive-by blueberry eater.
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.100]   If they're there, I just kind of pick them up
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:58.900]   like a grizzly bear and cram them in my mouth.
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:01.300]   So keep them away from me if you don't want them eating.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.260]   But I almost can't help myself.
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:07.280]   I bit into a blueberry, or a handful of blueberries,
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.480]   and it was the sensation of little bags of water,
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:14.000]   and I immediately felt a tremendous grief.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.940]   - I'll tell you a sort of a throwaway line
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:18.980]   that I use in this when I talk with people.
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:25.560]   Take the two most basic behaviors that sustain us, right?
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:29.060]   Let's say I give you a choice
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:34.060]   between a beautiful-looking layer cake
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:39.540]   with strawberries and blueberries and whipped cream,
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.360]   but that smells of sewage,
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:48.140]   versus some gray-brown mix that smells of cinnamon.
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.460]   Which do you eat?
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:50.280]   - Simple, the latter.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.620]   - Right, you eat the latter, right?
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:54.660]   Now, imagine I offer you a mate.
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:57.380]   Choose the gender of your liking, right?
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:02.340]   It looks like a Greek god or goddess, right?
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.220]   But smells of sewage.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.380]   Or an ordinary-looking individual
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:09.460]   that smells of sin itself, who do you choose?
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:11.700]   - The latter.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:16.220]   - Right, so in the two most basic behaviors we have,
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:19.360]   we follow our nose, not our eyes, right?
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.140]   - Definitely not always in predictable ways,
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:22.660]   because you offered an extreme example,
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.160]   which is the best example.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:26.580]   But I, for instance, for reasons I don't know,
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.060]   I've never liked the smell of perfume, ever.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:31.880]   In fact, I find it aversive.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.160]   But I do, I confess, I do like the smell
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.340]   of certain body odors very much.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:42.400]   And I'm very particular about that.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.060]   And I know within an instant.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:49.500]   And so, this is a problem for any romantic partner
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:51.340]   who likes perfume for me.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:53.160]   But I know many people like perfumes
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:54.780]   and colognes and things of that sort.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:58.540]   And in fairness, I've also been told that,
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.580]   by someone, that they couldn't spend time with me
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:02.140]   because they do not like my smell.
[01:49:02.140 --> 01:49:03.660]   In fact, they dislike it.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.940]   And fortunately for me, there's at least one person
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.340]   on the planet who said the opposite.
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:12.500]   So, I completely agree with what you're saying.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.500]   I can also say that I imprinted on the smell of my,
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.300]   I had a bulldog mastiff when I raised
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:20.900]   from the time he was a puppy.
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:25.600]   And I imprinted on, I imprinted on his smell immediately.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.920]   And even though to other people,
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.240]   he was a bulldog mastiff after all,
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.360]   his smell was rather aversive.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.520]   To me, he smelled delicious, right?
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.960]   And it made me, it smelled like home.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:38.560]   And he was my best animal friend for a long time.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.440]   So, and on and on and on, right?
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.620]   The smell of children, as you said, the backs,
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.480]   we had a guest on this podcast who I'm sure you're familiar,
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.380]   Charles Zucker, a professor at Columbia,
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:49.240]   has done incredible work in vision and olfaction,
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:51.240]   they're sensing it, and he,
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.540]   and I talked a little bit about this,
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:57.240]   that there's something in the breath of romantic partners
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.340]   that's hopefully appetitive, not aversive,
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:04.240]   as well as in children, he was talking about the smell
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.700]   of his grandchild's, the nape of their,
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.760]   or the back of their neck, and how he misses that smell,
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.940]   because when he thinks about missing his grandchild
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:15.020]   or children, it's that smell
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.480]   that's associated with that feeling.
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.800]   - Hexadecimal.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:19.860]   - Hexadecimal.
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:20.700]   - Yes.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:22.760]   - Is that, Charles, your grandchildren smell
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.800]   like hexadecimal.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:24.640]   - Yes, they do.
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:25.460]   - He's gonna come after me now.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:26.300]   - They do.
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:31.140]   And so, this is a study ran by Eva Michor,
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.180]   who was a graduate student in our lab.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:39.500]   And Eva was interested in aggression.
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:42.400]   She was really into aggression.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:46.960]   And actually, when she started, and so when she started off,
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.840]   she said, "Okay, let's do chemo signaling of aggression."
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.320]   She actually was going to MMA clubs
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.260]   and collecting body odors.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:57.720]   And we had all sorts of ideas going,
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.960]   and she worked on that for quite a bit.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.400]   It never went anywhere, really.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.200]   And then, at the same time,
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:09.600]   we had a colleague of ours from Germany.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.240]   I mean, when I say colleague,
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:14.340]   primarily a friend or acquaintance I met at conferences,
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:20.920]   Heinz Breer, and he was studying in his lab,
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:29.280]   a molecule, hexadecimal, that was a chemo signal in mice.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.520]   Where in mice, it was described as a chemo signal
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.480]   that promotes social buffering.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:39.220]   Where social buffering, as far as I understand,
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.280]   it's not my field, but as far as I understand,
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:44.160]   it's basically a feel good together thing.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.600]   So when lots of mice are together,
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.720]   they feel good about being in a group,
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:49.600]   and that's social buffering.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.720]   And it's promoted by hexadecimal,
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.520]   which they emit in their feces, mice.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:59.620]   And in his work on hexadecimal,
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:03.520]   and so Breer and his colleague, Stortzman,
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.120]   they discovered the receptor for this,
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.440]   and then they went and discovered that the receptor
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:13.080]   is very highly conserved throughout mammalian evolution,
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:16.500]   and therefore they hypothesized that maybe
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:20.160]   this is a universal mammalian signal.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:23.140]   Now, which is unusual because in chemo signaling,
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.200]   typically you tend to think of things
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.340]   as being very species specific.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:30.220]   But here they hypothesized that maybe hexadecimal,
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:33.000]   which promotes social buffering in mice,
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.720]   may do something in all mammals.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:37.440]   Again, because this receptor is very highly conserved,
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.160]   OR37B, I think.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.820]   So he approached us and said,
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:45.760]   "Look, you gotta study this stuff in humans," right?
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.840]   Because he knows us as the human people, right?
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.200]   I mean, we go to these olfaction conferences
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:54.840]   where lots of people study mice and zebra fish and whatnot,
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.580]   and we're the human group.
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:53:02.000]   And eventually he just FedExed us hexadecimal.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.080]   And so we had this thing sitting around,
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.600]   and Eva was not going anywhere with her aggression studies
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.960]   with sweat from human participants,
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.360]   and yet she built the entire paradigm
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.520]   to study human aggression.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:19.600]   So they're standard paradigms.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.440]   This is a paradigm known as the TAP,
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:23.640]   the Tyler Aggression Paradigm.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.360]   I'll soon describe it.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:28.400]   And so we said, "Okay, we have this hexadecimal stuff here,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.780]   "and it promotes social buffering.
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:30.860]   "Social buffering sounds like
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:32.520]   "it would make you less aggressive.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:37.200]   "Why don't you run your TAP experiment using hexadecimal?"
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.720]   What's the TAP experiment?
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:43.320]   So basically what you do is you bring in a participant to lab
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:48.020]   and you have them thinking that they're gonna be playing
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:51.240]   against another person in this game.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.480]   And you can do something like have another person
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.200]   walk into the other room playing online, so connected.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.720]   So you can fool them into being quite convinced
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.280]   that this is what's happening.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.480]   And they go into their own room,
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:06.680]   and in the initial game they play,
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:12.120]   on each round they're provided with a sum of money,
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.580]   and this is real money that they'll receive
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.280]   at the end of the experiment.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.960]   And by turn, each one of them decides
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:20.800]   how to divide the money up between the two, right?
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.220]   So they're playing against another person, they think,
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.040]   but that's actually a computer algorithm
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.600]   that they're playing against.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:31.140]   And the computer algorithm is programmed
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:34.640]   to be in scientific terminology a jerk, right?
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:38.100]   So let's say they have to divvy up 100 shekel,
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.620]   which is the Israeli currency.
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.140]   So the other player would say,
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:46.620]   "Okay, I'll keep 96 and you get four," right?
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.660]   And then you can either accept it or not accept it,
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:52.640]   and then neither of you get anything, right?
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.060]   So basically you're being shafted
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:55.940]   by the other side all the time.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.100]   And this is called the provocation phase.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.680]   You're really getting angry at this person
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.640]   because they're really not nice, right?
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.420]   They're shafting you on every trial, almost.
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:08.980]   And you play this game and it goes to its end,
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:11.060]   and then you play a second game
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:14.260]   as far as you know against the same participant.
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.660]   And the second game is a reaction time game.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:20.260]   So a target shows up and the first to press it wins.
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:23.220]   And on every trial where you win, if you want,
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.040]   you can blast the other participant with a loud noise.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.740]   And it's a really loud noise.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:31.860]   So you're also wearing earphones, it's 90 dB,
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:34.260]   and it's a screeching, horrible sound.
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.980]   It's the most punishment that an IRB committee
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:40.620]   will let you endure on a participant in an experiment,
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:43.140]   unless you're in Stanford 70 years ago
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:43.980]   or whatever that was.
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.120]   - No, I was referring to the classic prisoner experiment,
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:47.660]   which took place in the building next door
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:49.940]   to where I work, by the way.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:51.740]   - So you can blast the other participant
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:53.620]   with varying levels of sound.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:56.140]   And you have a selection box from something very low
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.800]   to something very high.
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.900]   And what's nice about this is that it then allows you
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:03.380]   to quantify aggression because the more volume
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.860]   you're blasting the opponent with,
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:07.500]   the more aggressive you are towards your opponent.
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.980]   And so you have a measure of aggression.
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:11.760]   Again, the Tyler aggression paradigm,
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:15.500]   obviously invented by Tyler, very well validated,
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:18.900]   studied all over, a very standard protocol.
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:23.060]   So we brought in participants and had them play
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.820]   the Tyler, the tap, either under exposure
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:29.820]   to hexadecimal or control.
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:32.780]   Now, hexadecimal doesn't, it's incredibly difficult
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:34.860]   to even detect hexadecimal.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:39.220]   But just in case, because it's not very,
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.940]   it's considered a semi-volatile,
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:43.260]   it doesn't have a strong smell.
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:46.140]   But we buried both the control and the hexadecimal
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:49.340]   in a control order that hid them in a mask.
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:52.580]   And she ran lots and lots and lots and lots of participants,
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:53.480]   men and women.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.740]   And I'll first tell you the result with men,
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:02.300]   which is that hexadecimal consistently reduced aggression.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:05.580]   People were less aggressive under hexadecimal.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:10.580]   The effect size was quite meaningful.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:14.260]   And later on we learned, because I'm no specialist
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.100]   in the world of aggression,
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.820]   but compared to effects seen in the aggression world
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.400]   in research, really, really strong effects.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.300]   So unusually strong.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.800]   So hexadecimal lowered aggression in men.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:26.540]   And we were like, cool, this is, you know,
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.700]   sort of what we were hoping to see,
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:31.060]   consistent with the hypothesis
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:33.460]   and consistent with what it seems to do in mice.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.700]   But then we looked at data from women
[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:41.420]   and hexadecimal increased aggression, equally significantly.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.780]   - Is this thought to be something related
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.860]   to maternal protective?
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:44.800]   And we're getting there.
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.580]   So you got there really fast.
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:49.940]   It took me a year, but, and Eva got to it, really.
[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:51.540]   I'll tell you.
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:53.380]   Because remember, we're reaching the back of the head
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:56.780]   of your, of whose was it?
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:57.600]   Grandchildren?
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.440]   - Charles Zucker.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.280]   - Charles Zucker.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.740]   - The Charles Zucker, one of the kingpins
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:03.620]   of the New York neuroscience mafia.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:08.620]   - Yes, so this was really odd to me at that time.
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.660]   So I didn't have the intuition you just had.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.900]   And I was like, Eva, this, there was some bug here.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.740]   I mean, this, it makes no sense to me.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:19.360]   You know, why would something increase aggression in women
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.800]   and decrease aggression in men?
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.800]   This is really, really strange.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:27.360]   And I said, okay, I wanna see this happen again
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.480]   before, you know, we go ahead with this.
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:31.560]   So she went and did the entire experiment again.
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:34.280]   And this time she did it within the fMRI magnet
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.860]   so that we can also track brain activity
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.020]   while this was happening.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:43.080]   And first of all, it replicated again.
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:47.480]   So once again, hexadecimal made men less aggressive
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.180]   and women more aggressive.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:52.500]   And the extent of more than the effect alone,
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.280]   the dissociation was remarkable.
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:57.240]   This has, it's almost like a chromosomal test.
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:00.340]   I mean, you look at the data on the unit slope line
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:03.520]   and all the men are below and all the women are above.
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.740]   There's this figure in the paper.
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:08.720]   Then she also looked at the brain data.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.520]   And this is, you know, although our lab does a ton of fMRI,
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.520]   it's one of the major tools we use
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:17.440]   to measure brain activity.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:22.360]   I'm quite cognizant of the limitations of fMRI.
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.600]   And this is, I think sadly,
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.820]   I think the only study in my career at least
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:30.480]   where I actually managed to also get a mechanism
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:35.160]   out of fMRI, not only an area that's involved in activity.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.020]   And so here's what we saw,
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:42.020]   that hexadecimal alone increased activity
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:43.960]   quite pronouncedly in an area of the brain
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:46.560]   known as the left angular gyrus.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.860]   Now this is an area involved
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.340]   in what's referred to as social appraisal.
[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:53.140]   So that was kind of cool in that a social order
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.700]   activated the social brain,
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:59.160]   not the olfactory system per se, and very pronounced.
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.660]   So on one hand that was cool,
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:05.340]   but then what was uncool was that it did the same
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:06.800]   in men and women.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.680]   And this was in contrast to behavior,
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.920]   which you don't like seeing, right?
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:12.360]   I mean, because you would expect brain activity
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.200]   to reflect behavior.
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:16.640]   And it increased activity in the left angular gyrus
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:19.160]   in both men and women.
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.560]   But then she did a follow-up analysis,
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.140]   which was look at what's referred to
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.040]   as functional connectivity.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.480]   That is, how does this region of the brain
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:30.320]   talk with the entire brain as it were
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.240]   under hexadecimal versus control?
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.560]   And here the dissociation reemerged powerfully
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:41.900]   whereby the connectivity from the angular gyrus
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:45.720]   was mostly to the classic neural substrates of aggression,
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.800]   so the amygdala and the temporal pole,
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.280]   and the connectivity went in opposite directions
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:52.480]   in men and women.
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:56.880]   So hexadecimal increased functional connectivity in men
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:59.180]   and decreased it in women.
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.680]   So in a way, this is almost saying
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:03.600]   that the default brain reaction is aggression, right?
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   The default is to aggress.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.900]   And in men, hexadecimal increases the control
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:12.680]   that the left angular gyrus is holding over your aggression
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:14.400]   and keeping you back.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.560]   And in women, it let it roam free
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:18.660]   and they became more aggressive.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:20.460]   But I was still puzzled.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:22.880]   So I was convinced this happened twice.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.840]   The MRO data provided not only a pattern,
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:29.880]   but a mechanism, which is unusual.
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:32.600]   And yet I was telling Eva, you know,
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.600]   but you know, this makes no sense to me.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.320]   And then her insight, which of course afterwards is like,
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.920]   duh, is no, there's a place where this makes perfect sense.
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:44.520]   And that is if you're a mammalian offspring,
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:48.900]   because paternal aggression is often directed at you.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:51.300]   There's infanticide all over
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:53.580]   and sadly there's male aggression
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:56.280]   towards human children as well.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:59.400]   And maternal aggression is often protective.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.380]   So if you're an offspring, if you have a molecule
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:03.940]   that will make your mother more aggressive
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:05.640]   and your daddy less aggressive,
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.100]   both of those are good for you.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:08.020]   So you're winning.
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:12.080]   So we remembered a recently published paper
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.240]   from a group in Japan.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.160]   That looked at the odors emanating from baby heads.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.980]   We now come full circle to Suker's grandchildren.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:24.540]   They used a method known as GCMS,
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:26.520]   gas chromatography mass spectrometry,
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:30.280]   to measure the volatiles from baby heads.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.680]   Because baby head odor is a cultural thing
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.840]   across cultures, even in Japan.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.920]   And so we quickly went to that paper
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:41.600]   and to see if one of the molecules that report
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.840]   is hexadecanol, and we were very disappointed
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.460]   that it wasn't one of the molecules
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:47.440]   that reported in the paper.
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:49.860]   And so we wrote to the authors,
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:52.680]   who are since then our co-authors,
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:56.280]   and we said, look, we're studying this molecule,
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:58.240]   hexadecanol, and we don't see in your results.
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.920]   And we were wondering, maybe you had some results
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:03.240]   that you didn't publish or some supplementary materials
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:06.840]   or whatever, and this lab, which is a hardcore GC lab,
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.960]   said, no, no, hexadecanol is a semi-volatile,
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.720]   which we knew.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.440]   And our previous paper was not directed
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.160]   to the semi-volatile range, but we can now do,
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:18.500]   use what's called GCXGC, double GC,
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.960]   that is directed at semi-volatiles,
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:21.800]   and we can do this again.
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:24.400]   We just studied 11 babies,
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.560]   and we can see if this is an issue.
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.340]   So we said, yeah, please do.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.520]   The bottom line of all this is that hexadecanol
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:34.320]   is the most abundant semi-volatile in baby heads.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:36.800]   It's tons of it coming out of baby heads.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:39.080]   So babies, again, speaking about if humans
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:41.800]   who don't chemosign, well, babies are conducting
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.160]   chemical warfare, right?
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:48.160]   They're reducing aggression in their fathers
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:52.980]   or males around them, and increasing aggression
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:54.920]   in their mothers or females around them,
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:57.460]   and both of those things are good for them.
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:03:58.340]   - Incredible.
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:03.080]   This is somewhat different than what we're talking about,
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.200]   and yet similar in other ways,
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.480]   because it's built off of anecdotal evidence,
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:12.920]   but it's anecdotal evidence that you hear all the time,
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.640]   and yet when you look in the scientific literature,
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.800]   at least by my read, the data are not clear,
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:19.880]   maybe even contradictory,
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:23.240]   and that relates to the coordination of menstrual cycles
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.800]   among co-housed women or women who are friends.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.840]   Many women listening to this,
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:32.100]   and maybe some men who are aware of this effect,
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.520]   will say, oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:36.280]   When I spend time with my friends or go away camping
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:37.500]   or even spend a day with them,
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:39.880]   our menstrual cycles become coordinated.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.500]   However, my understanding is that the early literature,
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.360]   Barbara McClintock, discovered this phenomenon,
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:49.520]   published a paper in Science as an undergraduate.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:51.120]   - 1971, Nature.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.040]   - Amazing, Nature paper.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.680]   Again, one of the three apex journals,
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:55.920]   and as an undergrad, fantastic.
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.060]   So discovered this, described this,
[02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:59.840]   and probably women all over the world
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.880]   who became aware of this one way or another
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.500]   probably said, yes, absolutely.
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:06.980]   This gives validation to what we've observed over and over.
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:09.840]   And yet, as subsequent papers have been published,
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.920]   this result has been called into question.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:16.920]   Is there any final word on whether or not menstrual cycles
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.520]   become coordinated among women who spend time together,
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:23.880]   and if so, is there any role of olfaction in this,
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.800]   or chemosensing through the nostrils and/or mouth
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:30.560]   to support this idea?
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:35.560]   - So yeah, so I'll start off indeed to echo the background
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:39.920]   is that this study was conducted by Martha McClintock
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:42.940]   when she was an undergraduate at Wesleyan College.
[02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:47.120]   And she noticed that she thought her menstrual cycle
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.300]   and her co-inhabitants in her dorm room
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:53.580]   were coordinated in time.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:58.240]   And I should say that this comes on the basis of similar
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.060]   or related type effects in rodents.
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:03.660]   Now, rodents don't have a menstrual cycle like humans do,
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:08.420]   but there's an effect in rodents referred to
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:13.420]   as the Witten effect, which resembles this type of effect.
[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:17.920]   And she published indeed that paper as an undergraduate
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.640]   in Nature in 1971.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.520]   And to answer your question, she published a followup
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:27.520]   in 1998, also in Nature, with then her graduate student
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:32.620]   at Chicago Stern, so this is Stern and McClintock, 1998.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:33.940]   And here's what they did.
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:38.940]   They collected sweat from donor women and deposited it
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:43.120]   on the upper lip of recipient women.
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:45.720]   So this would be a fun experiment for you, at least,
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.120]   because you said you like body odors,
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:50.120]   but for many others, perhaps it would be daunting.
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:53.080]   - Well, I like certain body odors from certain individuals.
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:55.520]   - Okay. (laughs)
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:58.180]   - I don't think I uniformly like all body odors,
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:01.540]   although I do seem to uniformly not like the smell
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.460]   of perfume, although I, just to clarify,
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:04.940]   'cause I put this out there and I learned the hard way
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.660]   in the comment section on YouTube,
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:10.040]   some of those perfumes I find downright aversive.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.520]   Like it's, I think the great Marcus Meister,
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:14.160]   who a great neurobiologist once said,
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.420]   there's basically three responses.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.440]   It's either yum, yuck, or meh.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.060]   So some are truly yuck.
[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.900]   - I've never heard that one.
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:20.900]   - Kinda like that one, right?
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:23.140]   In terms of the animal behavior, human behavior,
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:26.540]   we're either a move forward, move back, or pause.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:29.320]   So some are truly a yuck.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:32.860]   Some, many are meh.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:37.700]   Zero to date are yum for me.
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:39.980]   Now, body odors, the distribution has shifted.
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.580]   It could be any one of those three, yum, yuck, or meh.
[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:43.740]   So just to be clear,
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:47.720]   but the yum category is definitely included.
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:51.100]   Thank you for allowing me to do that.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.340]   (laughing)
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:56.580]   So she did this study.
[02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:59.060]   So because right in the original McClintock study,
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:02.820]   you might suspect other drivers of the effect.
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:04.900]   Let's say you accept the effect,
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:06.740]   but still there might be other social drivers
[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:08.540]   of the effect that are not body odor, right?
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:11.060]   There might be some dominant woman
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:12.660]   who's dominant in some other way,
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.300]   and this might be driving the coordination, right?
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.140]   So here there was no direct link
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:18.940]   between these women other than body odor.
[02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:21.220]   So if the effect re-emerged,
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.500]   it would definitely be an olfactory effect.
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:27.040]   And what she found is that if she took sweat
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:30.560]   from the follicular or the ovulatory phase of the donors,
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.160]   one extended the cycle in recipients
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:35.300]   and one shortened the cycle in recipient.
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:36.660]   I don't remember which was which,
[02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:41.660]   but basically definitely denoting a chemosignaling effect
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:46.820]   with opposing effects on duration
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:49.700]   based on the time it was collected from,
[02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:53.340]   again, published in Nature in 1998.
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:54.540]   That's it.
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:57.160]   There's a quotation, I think this is from,
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:05.260]   I'm not sure, but if something's published
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:06.540]   in Nature or Science,
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:09.380]   that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:11.620]   So with that in mind,
[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:19.020]   the findings were since called into question widely.
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:26.340]   One reason is just statistics of cyclic events
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.620]   are surprisingly complicated.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:31.380]   So it's tricky.
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:35.020]   Once you have a cyclic event, statistics become tricky.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:40.900]   And so Martha took a lot of heat on the statistics
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:45.880]   of claiming an effect.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:52.340]   And I think there was at least one effort of replication
[02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:54.100]   that didn't really work out.
[02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:57.780]   If you ask me, I'm on the fence.
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:01.620]   But I may be in a minority in my field.
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:06.620]   I think a majority in the field is currently negative.
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:08.180]   I'm not.
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:13.660]   And we've said in lab that we should do
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:14.920]   a planned replication.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.900]   We will.
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:20.300]   Again, it's a horrible study to run.
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:22.900]   It's tons of work, and you have to run it
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:24.160]   for a really long time.
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:30.140]   And so it's just completely non-trivial.
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:32.380]   But we have a graduate student now in lab
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:34.140]   interested in these exact things,
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:37.420]   Ruud Weissgroßen, and she's doing similar stuff,
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:39.620]   and I hope we'll do that.
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:42.580]   I hope we'll try to replicate this.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.660]   - Very interesting result.
[02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:49.180]   And I think interesting because of its real world,
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:51.940]   meaning outside the laboratory, of course,
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:55.180]   or experiment, analog, but also because
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:11:00.460]   pheromone effects and olfactory effects in humans
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:05.460]   seem unique among neurobiological/endocrine phenomena
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:10.300]   because there seems to be so many stories
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:13.060]   that we all have of the smell of our grandmother's hands
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:15.780]   or the recognizing the scent of somebody,
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:19.260]   or I knew from the moment that I smelled their breath,
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:23.100]   or I just liked their smell kind of thing.
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:27.460]   These kind of things that inform the deep potential
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:29.980]   for a real biological phenomenon,
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:31.820]   as opposed to the kind of thing like,
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.140]   oh, you just throw something out there.
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:36.760]   Oxytocin is bonding, and all of a sudden,
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.240]   the general public, to no fault of their own,
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.500]   comes to think that every aspect of bonding is oxytocin,
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:46.100]   and every defect in bonding is lack of oxytocin.
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:51.100]   But the general public provides a sort of a rich,
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:54.920]   it's fodder for exploring all these things,
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:57.560]   and a lot of times they turn out to be true,
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:58.720]   in the context of olfactory.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:00.940]   - Yeah, no, it's a very primal system.
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:05.940]   So it's linked to the most limbic, primal mechanisms
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:09.340]   in our brain, and it drives primal behavior.
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:10.660]   - It's an incredible system.
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:15.220]   I have a question about a particular study,
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:16.420]   but I'm just gonna cue it up,
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:18.700]   and you'll know immediately what I'm cuing up.
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:21.860]   And that is, what is the relationship
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:26.860]   between odors and hormones, and in particular, crying?
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:28.980]   - As I pointed out previously,
[02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:31.180]   the sort of flavor of the month
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:33.340]   in human social chemosignaling research
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:34.820]   is the smell of fear,
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:38.660]   and the media of the month is sweat, right?
[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:43.660]   So the few, maybe tens of labs in the world
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:48.060]   that study human social chemosignaling all collect sweat,
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:51.060]   and that's the media they look at.
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:52.620]   - Is it always from the armpit,
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.800]   or are there meaningful differences
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.940]   in terms of the sweat emitted
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:57.740]   from different locations on the body?
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:12:59.460]   - I already know the answer to that as I ask it,
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.140]   but let's just stay above the waistline and--
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:02.980]   - Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:04.540]   - Or below the waistline.
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:06.180]   We're biologists after all.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:09.180]   - We just, yeah, so it's funny.
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:11.140]   We're working on a paper on that right now
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:12.460]   on the smell of fear.
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:15.920]   So we have a nice paradigm for generating fear.
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:17.660]   We throw people out of airplanes.
[02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:19.180]   It's a very effective way to generate fear.
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:20.820]   - I have to come to your lab.
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:22.460]   It sounds like the greatest lab in the world.
[02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:24.340]   - We didn't invent that, by the way.
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:26.320]   The first to do that was,
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.280]   and I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly.
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.020]   I think it's Mujika Peroudi.
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:35.120]   But that's our paradigm for generating fear,
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:36.660]   and we started that on our own,
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:39.580]   but we've since entered into collaboration
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:41.940]   with the Israeli Paratroopers Brigade,
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.020]   and we now collect body odor from every first-time jumper.
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:50.500]   So we went that path because we,
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:52.620]   like everybody else in this field,
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:55.780]   you know, the holy grail there is finding the molecules.
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.240]   Right, I mean, if you'll have the fear molecules,
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:00.960]   that's a bonanza, right?
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:03.960]   Because I mean, you know, you can think of many reasons
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:05.860]   why it would be a bonanza, but for me, you know,
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:07.120]   if you find the molecules,
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.980]   you can then try and find the receptors.
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.420]   And when you find the cognate receptors,
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:14.160]   you can then develop blockers, and you can imagine,
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:19.160]   you know, what's the term I'm looking for?
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.380]   I'm switching into Hebrew.
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:24.100]   It's about midnight now, right?
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.520]   I'm sorry, it's two in the morning.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.020]   You're doing incredibly well considering
[02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:28.720]   the inversion of the circadian clock.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.680]   We would never know.
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:32.500]   No one traveled in today from Israel,
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:35.020]   so he's a circadian inverted, as we say.
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:40.380]   Anxiety, so you can imagine developing
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:42.500]   like a nasal spray against anxiety, right?
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:45.080]   Where you would quell those receptors
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.180]   and kill the fear response, right?
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:49.020]   Which rather than going the current path,
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:50.460]   which is through neurotransmitters
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:53.040]   that then have effects all over the place,
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.140]   you would be getting fear at its source, right?
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:58.500]   So that would be why I would want that.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.720]   And we figured out that doing that,
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.500]   you know, collecting fear from like three,
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:06.360]   four or five people in an experiment,
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:08.860]   you'll never be able to do analytical chemistry on that.
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:13.820]   So we now have a setting we call fear bank,
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:16.340]   which now has more than a thousand samples in it.
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:19.540]   So we're trying to do analytics on that.
[02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:23.800]   But in doing that, we've joined the crowd.
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.040]   Everybody's doing fear and everybody's doing sweat.
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.840]   And in one of our discussions in lab,
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.380]   we were saying, well, there's gotta be,
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:33.600]   or there potentially definitely could be
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:37.760]   additional bodily media that are playing
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.160]   into social chemo signaling.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:43.340]   Now, many of these, you know, you can't really study, right?
[02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:45.280]   I mean, so, you know, just to throw it,
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.120]   most terrestrial mammals communicate
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:48.720]   social information through urine.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:51.540]   But, you know, starting doing experiments
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:53.660]   with humans with smelling urine,
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.420]   it would be difficult, you know,
[02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:58.940]   both in IRB and in agreement and, you know.
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:02.580]   And then we, you know, this is a rare case
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.640]   where we actually hypothesized what we set out to do.
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:07.020]   And, you know, did only claim in retrospect
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:11.140]   that it was hypothesis, is tears.
[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:16.700]   We started thinking about tears and looking into tears
[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:21.700]   because tears are a bodily liquid, emotional tears,
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:24.740]   that we emit in emotional situations
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:27.640]   where these are situations where nonverbal communication
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.340]   is critical and key.
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:35.300]   And tears are a liquid that is puzzling
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:41.560]   beyond ocular maintenance, right?
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:46.160]   And so, you know, the most influential text,
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:49.220]   I think till this day, in emotion research,
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:53.320]   is Darwin's book, The Showing of the Emotions
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:56.320]   in Men and Animals, I think is the full name of the book.
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:00.800]   And an entire chapter, chapter six, is devoted to tears.
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.040]   An entire chapter of this book, why?
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:05.820]   With no conclusion, why?
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:08.600]   Because the book revolves around
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:13.220]   describing the functional antecedents
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:15.020]   of emotional expressions.
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:17.540]   So for example, showing of the teeth
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.320]   is a sign of aggression, right?
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.600]   So animals first bit with their teeth
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.580]   and Darwin argued that through evolution,
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:28.080]   just showing the teeth alone became an aggressive sign
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:30.400]   because it started from biting.
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.600]   Or what I find is a beautiful example,
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:34.960]   and this is work partly done by Adam Anderson
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.960]   now at Cornell, is the emotional expression of disgust.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:46.560]   So disgust, which comes from one, disguise, distaste, right?
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.480]   Is spitting something out of your mouth.
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:54.480]   Now what Adam showed is that the musculature patterns
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:59.160]   of activation and the temporal sequence of activation,
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.520]   when you experience moral disgust,
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:04.000]   are the same as when you spit a bitter taste
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.300]   out of your mouth, right?
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.800]   So again, so there's a functional antecedent
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:09.640]   spitting something out.
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:12.640]   And through evolution, the argument was that it became
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:15.280]   an expression of emotion and you express disgust
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:17.080]   just as if you're spitting something out of your mouth,
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:18.960]   even though in the case of moral disgust,
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:21.120]   there's nothing you're spitting out of your mouth.
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:24.240]   So Darwin systematically went through the expressions
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.900]   of emotions and for each one,
[02:18:25.900 --> 02:18:27.680]   went to their functional antecedent
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:29.680]   and explained everything very nicely.
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:31.260]   And then he got stuck with tears, right?
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:34.040]   Because tears are an obvious emotional expression
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:39.040]   and he could not find a functional antecedent.
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:41.920]   So he ended up saying this is an epic phenomenon basically,
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:43.040]   right, I don't know.
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:44.880]   - What all scientists do when they don't have
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:47.520]   a good explanation, blame it on nature.
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:48.360]   - Right, right.
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:52.140]   But he bothered to write this entire chapter
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:56.400]   on the ocular sort of maintenance function of tears
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.800]   and so on and so forth, but nothing emotional.
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:00.760]   So we thought, well, maybe the function
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.200]   is a chemical signal.
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:10.920]   So with that in mind, we harvested emotional tears,
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:14.020]   which was also an amusing event on its own, right?
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:19.020]   Because we posted messages on all sorts of boards
[02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:27.800]   that were seeking experiment participants
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:29.060]   who cry with ease.
[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:33.980]   Now this generated an unfortunate gender bias in our study,
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:36.920]   right, because we received about 100 women volunteers
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.480]   and about one man.
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.960]   And I think this is not a problem only in macho Israel,
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:43.440]   probably anywhere in the West.
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:45.040]   I mean, definitely in America it would be the same,
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:45.880]   I think.
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:47.320]   - My guess is that there are probably men out there
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:49.920]   who cry easily, emotional tears.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:50.760]   - Oh, I'm sure.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:51.580]   - But they're not gonna show up.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:52.420]   - Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:54.800]   It's a cultural thing, you're not gonna come to a lab
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.600]   and say, I cry all the time, it's just not gonna happen.
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:04.560]   And then what we did is for each one of these participants,
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:08.620]   we would ask them, is there a particular film event
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:11.560]   that you know of, a scene that makes you cry?
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.940]   And interestingly in these effective criers,
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:18.400]   there's always, oh yes, the scene in so and so,
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:20.520]   I always cry profusely from that.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:21.360]   You know, they have their--
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:22.180]   - Can you give me an example
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:24.140]   of one of the more commonly known scenes?
[02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:25.940]   - Yeah, with ease.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:28.620]   The movie The Champ.
[02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:32.760]   The Champ dies, he's a boxer.
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:36.340]   And he dies literally in the hands
[02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:38.680]   of his about eight-year-old son.
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:44.140]   And his son is standing next to his bed
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:46.780]   and you know, saying, champ, champ.
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:48.780]   And he dies, right?
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:51.660]   It's a winner, okay?
[02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:53.500]   - Waterfalls.
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:54.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.240]   - Got it.
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.340]   - So you know, we're probably the neurobiology lab
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:01.120]   with most sad movie films on those shelves in the world,
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:02.620]   right, we have a whole huge collection.
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:05.300]   - There is such a thing as tears of joy, by the way.
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.340]   - So no.
[02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:07.180]   - No?
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.780]   - Well, we're going ahead of ourselves,
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:11.900]   but I have to say, we tried to collect them and failed.
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:15.180]   Even people who think they shed tears of joy and laughter,
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.740]   their eyes water a bit, but it's not the same thing.
[02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:23.140]   In the effective criers we end up screening,
[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:27.600]   so we collect a full ML of tears,
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:30.500]   a full ML of tears in about 15 minutes.
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:32.540]   So that's pouring, right?
[02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:34.500]   And that doesn't happen from laughter.
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:36.500]   Or we've never seen that.
[02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:38.940]   We've never seen that happen from laughter, we tried.
[02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:44.580]   So we have all these sad films,
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:47.460]   and by the way, one of the amusing things is
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:51.580]   when we ultimately published this paper in Science,
[02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:53.900]   we were forced, in retrospect,
[02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:57.100]   to go out and actually buy the films, right?
[02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:59.920]   I mean, originally we downloaded them from here and there,
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:02.920]   but you can't because you'd be violating copyright laws.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:09.100]   Right, so we had to buy, purchase all these films
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:10.740]   that the participants-- - And watch them.
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:13.000]   - So we actually have these in lab,
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.400]   like DVDs that we actually purchased.
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:21.140]   - Nice coverage of potential legal fallout there, gnome.
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:22.440]   - No, no, no, no, we did.
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:23.860]   - No, I believe you, I believe you.
[02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:24.780]   - Yeah, it was that.
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:25.860]   - I believe you.
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:30.540]   - So, and yeah, and well, we can touch on that later.
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:38.780]   So most of these volunteers who come saying
[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:42.540]   they can cry with ease actually don't meet the bill.
[02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:45.740]   And so out of the about 100 at least more women
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:49.300]   that we screened, we ended up with about six
[02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:54.300]   who could really come to lab week after week in poor tears.
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:57.060]   - There's a name for this in psychiatry,
[02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:00.100]   they call it narrative distancing.
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:02.180]   Some people, when they watch a film
[02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:06.540]   where someone's getting hit, they flinch quite a lot.
[02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:08.320]   It's almost as if they're experiencing it,
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.960]   but it works in the opposite direction too.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:12.860]   I know someone like this, where if they watch a film
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:16.340]   that someone's experiencing something even mildly positive,
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:19.620]   their mood elevates, so they can quickly bridge.
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:22.720]   And it's not always adaptive, as you can imagine,
[02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:24.700]   so there's lack of narrative distancing.
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:27.260]   - Right, yeah, one issue you can bring up
[02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:28.660]   with this entire line of studies in our lab
[02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:31.220]   is I don't know if there's something very unique
[02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:33.260]   about the donors, right?
[02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:34.980]   I mean, we're assuming these are tears.
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:35.980]   - No, this is pretty common.
[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:37.900]   I think that the numbers I saw out there
[02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:40.460]   are about five to 8% of people.
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:43.260]   - That's exactly what we got about, right, about 600?
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:48.260]   - So we collected tears, and we exposed participants
[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:58.100]   to these tears, and we found a few things.
[02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:00.740]   First of all, the tears are completely odorless.
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:04.240]   You cannot detect them at all, completely odorless.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:09.340]   And yet, when you sniff them,
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:14.340]   you have a pronounced reduction in testosterone
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:18.380]   within about 20 minutes, half an hour.
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:21.220]   - This is men and women smelling women's tears,
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:24.620]   men smelling women's tears, but not perceiving any odor.
[02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:26.940]   - Nothing, just sniffing them.
[02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:31.940]   And you have about a 14% drop in free testosterone, free.
[02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:35.220]   - Okay, so this is testosterone
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:37.420]   that's already been liberated from the testes.
[02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:38.260]   - Free testosterone.
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:41.900]   - We've done a few hormones that's either bound or unbound,
[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:45.220]   is unbound, excuse me, from sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:46.940]   et cetera, and it's the active form.
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:51.940]   So it's subject to very short timescale changes.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:55.100]   - Yeah, and this is, you know,
[02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:58.060]   people who study testosterone, which is not me,
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:00.340]   but they tell me this is a really strong effect.
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:02.320]   Like, it's hard to even pharmacologically
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.260]   get an effect like that that fast.
[02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:05.940]   I mean, no one pharmacology.
[02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:08.160]   - Yeah, years ago, I spent time studying endocrine effects
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:12.060]   of this sort, and that's a tremendous resized effect.
[02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:14.800]   - So, and so here I'll point out in passing
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.100]   that one of the concerns we had
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:22.620]   because of the effort to run this study
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:26.220]   is that nobody would ever try to replicate it.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:28.780]   And to our joy, about two years later,
[02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:33.020]   an independent group from South Korea,
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:35.860]   Oh It Al, who I don't know at all,
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.560]   replicated the testosterone effect to a T.
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:40.840]   I mean, like, same numbers.
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:44.580]   So it lowers testosterone.
[02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:49.580]   And we then also looked, using MR,
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:55.000]   at the effect on brain activity
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.280]   and saw a pronounced effect on activity,
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:02.800]   a dampening, a lowering of activity
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:07.040]   under an arousing state, a lowering of activity,
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.900]   both in the hypothalamus and in the fusiform gyrus,
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:13.340]   for whatever reason, I don't know.
[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:14.420]   - Face recognition area.
[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:16.300]   - Amongst other things, yes.
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:20.280]   And we don't know why, but pronounced.
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:25.780]   And currently, Shania Groen in our lab
[02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:27.900]   is replicating this again,
[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:31.600]   and this time with a stronger behavioral component,
[02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:36.700]   and I can share with you unpublished data now under review,
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:40.000]   that's, as you would expect,
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.500]   given the effect on testosterone, perhaps,
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:44.540]   sniffing tears lowers aggression in men,
[02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:47.720]   using again the TAP, the same experiment
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:51.320]   used by Eva in the hexadecimal experiment.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.000]   - The TAP, I'm gonna think of that as the SEDIS,
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:57.440]   the control, the titration, the SEDIS titration.
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:59.480]   - Yeah, yeah, Tyler aggression paradigm.
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:01.300]   - So not unlike the Milgram experiments
[02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:04.780]   of the 1950s, which post,
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:08.700]   this is looking at sort of post-Holocaust behavior,
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:12.780]   people basically in American laboratories
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:14.980]   thinking they were torturing other people
[02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:16.260]   simply because they were told to,
[02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.900]   and a lot of people did that,
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:19.120]   even though most people would report
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:20.060]   that they would never torture someone else.
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:23.120]   - Yeah, yeah, no, humans are not a wonderful species.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:26.140]   - Or, as we could say, I think it was the great Carl Jung
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:29.500]   that said, "We have all things inside of us,"
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:34.280]   but the goal is not to experience them all, certainly.
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:37.260]   It's an incredible study, and it points, again,
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:42.260]   to the power of these chemosensory systems and pathways,
[02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:46.860]   and obviously there's so much here.
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:49.540]   - I don't know if you want me to tell about this or not,
[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:51.260]   and I guess you can edit it out if you don't,
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:53.860]   but this is just sharing stories
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:55.660]   about the politics of science.
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:00.180]   - So whereas the effect on testosterone
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:03.800]   was replicated by an independent group,
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:07.380]   in the original study in science,
[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:09.820]   where it had three components.
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:13.900]   One was the effect on testosterone, which was robust,
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:16.540]   the second, which was brain activity, which was robust,
[02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:22.640]   and there was a significant but weaker effect on behavior,
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:24.520]   and I don't think we studied the right behavior
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:25.360]   in retrospect.
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:29.600]   What we looked at then was ratings of arousal
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.600]   associated with pictures, and there was an effect.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:38.240]   It was significant, but it was not what carried the story.
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:45.100]   Now, there's a lab in Holland of a guy by the name of,
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:49.920]   I'm probably mispronouncing this,
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.180]   but I think it's Vingerhoutz.
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:55.040]   - For the non-Dutch.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:55.880]   - Yeah.
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.040]   - Dutch names are always a little bit of a challenge, but.
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:00.720]   - And I shouldn't say that, being an Israeli,
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:02.500]   I shouldn't go too much on that line,
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:07.500]   but that lab really didn't like our original tear story,
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:12.080]   and the reason they didn't like it
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:17.080]   is because they've built a career on this notion,
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:20.260]   including a book with this title
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:22.660]   that emotional tears are uniquely human.
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:28.740]   Now, here I should, well, I should share,
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:33.740]   so one of the things we really liked about the tear result
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:37.800]   is that partially before we did our work,
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:39.840]   but more afterwards, and we liked that
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:40.800]   because usually things,
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:42.320]   so usually in our chemo signaling work,
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:44.240]   like what I told you before about the Bruce effect,
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:45.620]   we look at what happens in ruins,
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:48.080]   and we see if the same thing is happening in humans.
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.780]   This was a rare case where after we did this work,
[02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:55.820]   more or less identical effects were discovered in rodents.
[02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:59.120]   So a paper published in "Nature" two years later
[02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:03.280]   found that mouse tears, mouse pup tears,
[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:07.720]   lower aggression in male adult mice towards them.
[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:09.800]   - In a smell-dependent way.
[02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:13.280]   - Yeah, yeah, and they also actually found
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:16.760]   the actual component in tears, so the tear pheromone,
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.520]   that lowers aggression, right?
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.960]   So this has us thinking of tears as,
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:24.180]   you can think of tears as like a chemical blanket
[02:30:24.180 --> 02:30:26.920]   in a way that you're covering yourself up again
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:30.000]   with, to protect against aggression, right?
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:35.000]   And so our finding, which to me, I mean,
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.300]   this is consistent with how I think about behavior
[02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:41.160]   in general, I don't think, beyond language,
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:43.440]   there are very few things, definitely sensory things
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:47.680]   that are uniquely human, I'd be hard pressed.
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.680]   But so our finding went against their story, right?
[02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:54.920]   Because here we're saying, no,
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:58.400]   tears are this chemo signaling mechanism like all animals.
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:01.160]   And by the way, just after this entire debate,
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:05.240]   about six months ago, there was a paper in "Current Biology"
[02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:07.920]   that dogs emit emotional tears.
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:10.960]   And the dogs emit emotional tears
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:13.320]   when they reunite with their owners.
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:18.120]   And you were talking before about oxytocin.
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:20.840]   So I think what they showed there is that not only that,
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:25.840]   but that the view, seeing the tears in the dog
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:29.520]   influences oxytocin in the humans.
[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:31.680]   I hope I'm getting this right.
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:33.480]   - No, I absolutely believe this.
[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:36.840]   I mean, from the time I brought Costello home
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:37.800]   at eight weeks old.
[02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:38.640]   - Costello's your dog.
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:40.000]   - He's my dog, unfortunately he passed away,
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:40.960]   but had him a long time.
[02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:45.200]   Actually, the only time I can recall crying,
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:47.280]   listen, I've certainly cried before,
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:50.040]   many times in my life, many, many times.
[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:53.920]   The only time I ever recall crying to the point
[02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:56.480]   where I wasn't sure that I could keep producing tears,
[02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:59.080]   but somehow it is when I had to put him down, right?
[02:31:59.080 --> 02:32:01.360]   Is this like, you know, and if I talk about too long now,
[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:04.000]   I'll start crying, you know, it's one of those things.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.520]   I think it's a healthy emotional state.
[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:09.600]   But I recall when he was a puppy thinking
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:11.560]   this oxytocin thing must be real
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:14.320]   because I can recall being in faculty meetings,
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:16.880]   which, you know, are fairly stated
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:18.120]   are not always that interesting,
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:19.320]   but they could be pretty interesting.
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:22.800]   And someone presenting data in my mind thinking,
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:25.480]   I hope Costello's okay, what's he doing down in my office?
[02:32:25.480 --> 02:32:26.840]   This is when he was very little.
[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:29.960]   And also not needing to eat,
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:32.320]   not being able to focus on anything else
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.400]   except my attachment to him for about the first
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.440]   two or three weeks that I had him, then it was easy.
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:38.120]   Then I could focus off on other things.
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:41.920]   I think that dogs, perhaps through oxytocin,
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:44.960]   hijack the circuitry that's intended for child rear.
[02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:45.800]   I really do.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:48.240]   Otherwise, why would people be so ridiculously
[02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:49.680]   attached to their dogs?
[02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:52.120]   Hence all the posts of everyone thinks their dog
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.640]   is the cutest dog, the same way everyone thinks
[02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:55.760]   their children are the cutest children.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:58.080]   Costello, by the way, was a very handsome bulldog.
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:00.320]   (laughing)
[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:04.640]   - So again, so even, you know, to put another nail
[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:07.960]   in that story of tears are uniquely human,
[02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:08.800]   so they're not.
[02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:11.000]   Dogs shed emotional tears.
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:16.080]   And so that group really didn't like this,
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:20.920]   and they went ahead and tried to replicate.
[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:23.640]   And to your listeners, I'm showing double quotations
[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:26.480]   on the replicate, only the behavioral part,
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:31.480]   the ratings of arousal in women, of women,
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:35.640]   and failed to replicate that.
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:36.680]   - I see.
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:40.120]   Now, this was, you know, just sharing on how science works
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:43.520]   and doesn't work in my notion in this case.
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.520]   So at the time, after they got this accepted
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:54.280]   in some journal, not a field journal,
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.760]   in the journal of memory of something,
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:03.460]   they contacted me for a response.
[02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:06.200]   And I wrote to the authors, and I said,
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.640]   "Look, you know, this is very odd to me.
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.160]   Why don't you come, why don't we replicate this again
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.440]   together and see if it doesn't work.
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:15.120]   If it doesn't work, I'll publish it with you
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:16.920]   that it doesn't work, but you know."
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:20.360]   And so I said, "Why don't you send over a graduate student
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.160]   or the lead author, and we'll do it here,
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:23.600]   and we'll show them how it's done?"
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:26.400]   Because they did it very wrongly in the paper.
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.840]   And so they replied that, "No, they don't have money
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:31.880]   to send over a graduate student to do it."
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:35.800]   So I replied saying, "Okay, I'll fund the graduate student
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.560]   coming over and I'll fund the entire study
[02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:40.120]   and their stay and so on and so forth,
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:41.640]   and let's do this together."
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:45.280]   And they replied, "No, they're not willing to do that,"
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:47.920]   which I don't think is the way things should work.
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:52.920]   And they published this sort of failed behavioral effect
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:55.560]   in that paper.
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:57.960]   So I'm just sharing this, you know, that it's not only,
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:59.920]   there was that successful replication
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:01.540]   with the effect on testosterone,
[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:03.520]   but there was supposedly this failed replication
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:05.320]   on the effect in behavior.
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:09.960]   And then I published a rebuttal on that,
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.960]   which I don't know if I should have done, but I did.
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.440]   - Well, I think it's interesting.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:17.440]   I mean, I think provided studies are done correctly,
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:20.440]   I mean, the positive result almost always trumps
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:23.840]   the negative result, and yet I think replication is key.
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:24.800]   The problem, as you pointed out,
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:27.160]   is that replication is rarely pure replication
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:28.520]   of the exact study. - Yeah, yeah, this one
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:31.760]   is not even remotely, but I published a detailed,
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:34.320]   so actually they hid something in their data
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:35.440]   that did partially work.
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:37.600]   So I asked for their data and I reanalyzed it,
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.480]   and that's what I published in the rebuttal.
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:42.160]   But you know, this is just sharing on how science works.
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:46.440]   I took advice, so it's not that I'm friends with him,
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:48.600]   but at that time I was communicating a bit
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:52.840]   because we were on some board with Daniel Kahneman,
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:54.960]   who's a Nobel lawyer. - Thinking fast and slow.
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:59.140]   - Right, and so I asked him, "How should I deal with this?"
[02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:01.800]   You know, give me some advice here.
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:05.800]   Yeah, I was really, you know, it was emotionally not fun
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:07.440]   to be in that position.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:12.440]   And he said, "Don't, never publish a rebuttal.
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:14.320]   "Don't do anything."
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:15.960]   And I was, you know, "How can I?
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:16.800]   "I have to do something."
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:19.020]   He said, "No, don't, because once you do that,
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:21.560]   "then people don't go into the details.
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.140]   "They won't read the details of your rebuttal.
[02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:25.220]   "They'll be like, well, there's a group that says this
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:26.520]   "and there's a group that says that."
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:29.200]   So it's unclear, and-- - Yeah, I mean,
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:30.800]   I appreciate that you're bringing it up today,
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:33.400]   and I do appreciate that you publish the rebuttal
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:36.040]   and that you offered, in a very magnanimous way,
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:38.960]   to do a collaboration. - That's what he then said.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:41.360]   So Kahneman's advice after that was that,
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:46.360]   well, if you insist, then just publish, write a response
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.600]   that you offered them to come do it together.
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:51.320]   They refused, and there's nothing you can do about that.
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:54.320]   - It's a lot like fight sports, right?
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:55.880]   People talk a lot of trash.
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:57.720]   Although in science, you know, I will say this,
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:00.120]   you know, as long as we're on the sociology of science,
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:01.400]   the stakes are lower.
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.240]   - Science is very different than podcasting
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:05.600]   or social media or other fields,
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:08.800]   because in science, people generally are very kind
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:12.320]   to your face, and then you get it in the neck
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:16.120]   on grant reviews or anonymous reviews.
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:17.560]   I was on a grants review panel this morning.
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:20.360]   I'm a nice reviewer, meaning I judge things objectively,
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:23.920]   but I try to always think from the perspective
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:26.960]   of the graduate student or author of the proposal.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:31.360]   - Listen, I think that science is a game of people
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:33.760]   who most of them are seeking facts.
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:37.520]   However, the ego is strongly woven into it,
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:38.720]   like anything else.
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:41.280]   So I think it was very magnanimous of you
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:42.280]   to offer the collaboration.
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:45.040]   So I'm going to tell this lab whose name I can't pronounce,
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:46.320]   please accept the collaboration,
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:49.840]   and then we can invite everyone on here for a round table.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:51.280]   I appreciate that you shared that story,
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.000]   and I know a number of other people will
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.400]   for a number of reasons.
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.280]   I have a couple of more questions, and I realize,
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:37:59.640]   and thank you, by the way,
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:02.400]   for your willingness and stamina,
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:04.920]   because it is probably 1 a.m. Israel time now,
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:08.480]   and you just arrived, but you're doing terrifically well.
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:12.120]   So if you'll indulge us just a touch further,
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:15.120]   there are two topics that I want to touch on,
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:17.440]   and if you want to cover these in Shorter Thrift,
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.160]   that's fine, although I don't feel any obligation to.
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:23.800]   The first one is I think most people are familiar
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:26.240]   with the scent of food or foods
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:29.600]   as a signal of the nutrient contents of those foods.
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:32.360]   An orange that smells great,
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.360]   or the smell of something baking,
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:37.520]   it suggests something about the contents
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:38.640]   and quality of that food.
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:41.180]   After all, you and I both separately lived
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:43.560]   in the same apartment in Berkeley above the cheese board,
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:45.880]   which the smell of cheese wafting up
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:47.960]   through the cheese board is something I will never forget,
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:49.960]   and the breads, never forget it.
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:52.480]   Amazing bread.
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.520]   - I don't know if you've conveyed that clearly enough
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:56.960]   to listeners or watchers.
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:57.800]   - No, the probability is-
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:59.860]   - That we really just discovered that we lived
[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:04.140]   in the same, we never met, I mean, like this before,
[02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:05.280]   and we lived in the same apartment.
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:07.220]   - Exactly, are we click friends?
[02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:09.880]   (laughing)
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.680]   - In a lingering way, I guess.
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:14.560]   - Absolutely, through the-
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:16.520]   - Floorboards, it had a great floor, that place.
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:17.360]   It had a great wooden floor.
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:18.280]   - It was an amazing place.
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.280]   I lived there with my girlfriend for a year and a half,
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.040]   and then it was an amazing place.
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:26.480]   We won't give out the address out of respect
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:28.600]   for the people that live there now,
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:30.300]   but do check out the cheese board if you're ever in Berkeley.
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:32.620]   Their hours are weird, so you have to look online,
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:35.620]   but it's a unique place with great bread and cheese
[02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:38.920]   and some good flavors of pizza.
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:43.280]   In any case, I'm wondering whether or not smell
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:49.160]   can signal things about the nutrient contents of foods
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:51.880]   in a way that's divorced from the smell
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:53.400]   that we are perceiving.
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:56.120]   So for instance, I could imagine,
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:59.400]   based on what you've told us about smell today,
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:04.400]   that I don't know, I smell a piece of meat cooking
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:08.700]   and it smells great to me.
[02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:11.080]   And I think of it as, oh, that's so savory
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:13.860]   and my mouth is watering and I love the smell of this.
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:16.280]   And I'm thinking, okay, this is protein and fat
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:18.960]   and I love the taste of steak and a little bit of char,
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:22.000]   but that nature has co-opted that
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000]   to ensure or I should say increase the likelihood
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:30.080]   that I will ingest some other thing that's in steak
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:33.120]   that has no odor but whose nutrient content
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:33.960]   is very important to me.
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:36.680]   For instance, amino acids, right?
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:39.560]   I mean, amino acids are essential to life
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:42.640]   and yet we don't go around sniffing for amino acids.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:45.640]   We go around sniffing for savoriness,
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:49.760]   umami type tastes and things of that sort.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:52.960]   So I could imagine a million different examples of this
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:55.720]   in the same way I could imagine that the scent of somebody
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:58.880]   that we fall in love with or become romantically attached to
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.640]   or sexually attracted to is signaling all sorts of things
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:05.340]   about sure, the potential for offspring
[02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:08.020]   of a particular immune status, that's a long-term game,
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:13.020]   but also something about pleasure and safety
[02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:14.840]   of a potential interaction.
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:17.200]   - So what I'm asking here is about whether or not
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:21.320]   there are subconscious signals that the olfactory system
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:24.960]   has learned to seek but learned to seek
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:27.320]   through more overt signals,
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:29.780]   sort of the tip of the iceberg phenomenon.
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:31.920]   - So you know, I don't have a good answer for you,
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:34.120]   although I think it's a really good question
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:37.480]   or a good idea, in fact.
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:42.480]   So whether there's, you know,
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:48.640]   odor cues on nutrient value is a really good idea.
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:51.440]   Moreover, it's probably good to the extent
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:54.420]   that somebody probably did it and I should know and don't.
[02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:58.200]   We haven't done anything on that line.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:41:59.340]   So I don't know.
[02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:04.140]   I don't know if the nutrient value of food
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:06.880]   is systematically encoded in odor.
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:10.240]   If that's not been done,
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:13.920]   and I will check after our meeting today,
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:17.680]   then it should be, it's a really good idea.
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:20.000]   - I mean, one of the reasons I asked this is because,
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.740]   you know, the obesity crisis in the US is a huge issue
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:27.200]   and elsewhere and highly processed foods, you know,
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:28.880]   have a lot of things that are problematic,
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:32.840]   but one of the things that they don't have often
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:36.120]   is a direct relationship between the scent,
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:39.000]   the taste and the nutrient content.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.120]   I don't mean macronutrient, sugar, fat, excuse me,
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:43.800]   carbohydrates, fats, and proteins,
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:46.160]   but the vitamins and micronutrients,
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:47.600]   things that support the microbiome.
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:51.000]   Whereas foods that are not highly processed,
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.200]   for instance, meat or a piece of fruit,
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:56.760]   contain many micronutrients that are vital
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:58.000]   to aspects of our biology.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.120]   We don't go around sniffing for probiotics.
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:02.560]   - I'll tell you one sort of factoid
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:05.520]   that may support your hypothesis here.
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:10.520]   And that is that there appears to be potential olfactory
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:16.320]   perceptual similarity in metabolic products.
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:21.880]   So something that's metabolized from something else
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.880]   has perceptual similarity across those two things.
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:32.280]   So metabolic cascades play into the coding
[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:37.280]   of olfactory space, and that is consistent
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:40.920]   with the direction you're implying.
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:43.160]   But again, I don't know of a direct test
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.840]   of nutritional value in smell.
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:51.520]   And again, the fact that I don't know doesn't mean,
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:52.860]   of course, that it doesn't exist.
[02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:55.520]   And in this case, I would suspect that it should exist
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:59.260]   in scientific press, and if not there,
[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:03.220]   then with the companies that have vested interest in this,
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:04.060]   which are many.
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:08.540]   - Briefly share, just please.
[02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:10.200]   - An amusing anecdote to share with you
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:13.360]   is that we've received two independent
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:21.360]   companies who have turned to our lab recently
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:26.360]   asking for help to bring odor to engineered meat, right?
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:28.160]   That's a growing thing.
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:30.440]   And all these meats that are not--
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:31.920]   - Yeah, to bring it up.
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.760]   - This audience is going to be very polarized
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:37.300]   along the lines of engineered meat.
[02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:40.600]   You're not promoting.
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:42.960]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm agnostic.
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:47.020]   But we've had two companies turn to us and say,
[02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:48.720]   look, you know, we have this great product,
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:50.460]   but it just doesn't smell like meat,
[02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:52.640]   so help us make it smell like meat.
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:53.680]   - Interesting.
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:55.500]   The reason it's so polarizing is that anything
[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:57.680]   related to nutrition on social media
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.440]   is a total barbed wire topic.
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:01.040]   We've had experts on nutrition come on here,
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:02.060]   we'll have more, but--
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:04.060]   - I know nothing about nutrition.
[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:05.760]   - You're safe, no, don't worry.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:09.040]   No, he's not promoting, he hasn't even said
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:10.540]   whether or not he's going to help them out.
[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:12.680]   - No, we're not, actually.
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:15.520]   Not because, yeah, it didn't happen.
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:19.000]   - No, whether or not those engineered meats
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.920]   are yum, yuck, or meh is a personal issue
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:24.040]   to people in terms of taste.
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:26.640]   Whether or not they are better for,
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.400]   neutral or worse for you and the planet
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:31.760]   than given the ingredients that are required,
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:34.440]   that's a whole world we'll avoid now.
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:37.000]   - I will, but I'll take the opportunity
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.720]   to highlight something related, maybe,
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:43.800]   because on what you were saying on the scale,
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:47.600]   you know, I'll take the opportunity
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:52.080]   to dispel another misconception about olfaction, right?
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.400]   There's this common notion that our sense of smell
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:00.040]   is incredibly subjective, right?
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:02.040]   And that what you might like in a smell,
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:04.840]   I will not like in a smell, and that we all have our own,
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:08.320]   you know, totally subjective world of olfaction.
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:09.880]   - I think I know the study you're gonna tell me.
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:10.720]   - There are many.
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:11.880]   - The cross-cultural similarity.
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:15.120]   - There are many, that is utterly untrue.
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:17.640]   Many not only from my lab, there are many from many labs.
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:19.960]   - Please clarify for those that follow this literature.
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:24.960]   - So, yeah, so humans are incredibly subjective.
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:28.800]   Humans are incredibly similar to one another
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:30.640]   in their olfactory perception,
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:33.880]   and this is in contrast to what most people think.
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:36.440]   So why is there this misconception?
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:39.720]   The misconception is there for two reasons.
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:43.240]   First of all, or for several reasons, but two stand out.
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:47.280]   First of all, we're attracted by outliers,
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:50.040]   because, you know, I'll tell somebody,
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:52.880]   look, you know, for example, olfactory pleasantness
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:55.160]   is highly correlated amongst humans.
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:56.720]   And let's first put this in numbers.
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:59.400]   You'll take a bunch of humans and a bunch of odorants
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:01.040]   and have them rate pleasantness.
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:05.200]   The correlation across the humans will be about 0.8.
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:07.920]   That's incredibly high, incredibly high.
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:09.560]   - What do you think is pleasant, I think is pleasant.
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:10.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:15.640]   Now, why is that go against what culturally people think?
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:16.880]   For two reasons.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.880]   First of all, we're attracted or biased by outliers,
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:25.320]   but that's particularly, that shows, in fact, the result.
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:26.160]   What do I mean?
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:27.240]   So you'll tell somebody, look,
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:29.440]   people are very similar in their pleasantness estimates.
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:30.560]   And so you know that can't be.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.680]   I love cilantro and, you know,
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:35.080]   my girlfriend hates the smell of cilantro, right?
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:37.560]   Or, and there are a few classic examples there.
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:41.520]   Guiava, right, you know, is another polarizing odor.
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:44.040]   So there are a few polarizing odors, right?
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:45.480]   And that's true, right?
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:47.280]   So that's true that, you know,
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:49.320]   half of the population loves the smell of cilantro
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:52.440]   and half hates it, half loves guiava, half hates it.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:53.280]   That's true.
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:54.880]   - Microwave popcorn.
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:58.000]   - However, I assure you that, you know,
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:58.840]   you can come to our lab,
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.760]   we have about 1,000 odorants in our lab, okay?
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:03.280]   We won't smell the 1,000, right?
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:06.360]   But I assure you, you know, take 100 odorants, okay,
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:09.800]   from our mixtures and labs, right?
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:12.120]   And we'll smell them, right?
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:17.120]   And out of the 100 odors, 90 we'll totally agree on, right?
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.360]   And including, I mean, you know,
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:22.760]   nobody will say they like the smell of feces
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:25.560]   or fecal smells and everybody will say
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:28.440]   they like the smell of rose and flowery smells.
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:31.200]   There will be rare, rare exceptions.
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:34.280]   Again, the correlation is about 0.8 across individuals.
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:37.800]   So a 90 of 100 will usually be in high agreement.
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:41.440]   Then five odorants will be in sort of intermediate agreement
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.240]   and yes, there'll be the five odorants
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:45.400]   that we're in total disagreement on.
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:47.560]   But I asked you, you know, if we agree on 95
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:50.320]   and disagree on five, are we the same or are we different?
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:53.800]   We're the same, they're just outliers to this rule.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:58.040]   And so one reason is this issue of outliers attract
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.160]   how we think about things,
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:03.720]   but no, we're actually much more similar than what we think.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:07.360]   And the second thing that drives this cultural effect
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:12.080]   is our poor application of language to olfaction, right?
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:15.880]   So in other sensory systems, we grow up with,
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:18.720]   we develop with anchors, right?
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:21.960]   So since you're a little kid, your mother shows you a cow
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:24.000]   and says, what does a cow do, moo, right?
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.240]   And we all know moo, moo.
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:26.720]   And what color is this?
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:28.800]   It's, well, this is kind of an odd black,
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:29.720]   but it's black, right?
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:30.880]   Or what color is that?
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:31.840]   It's red, right?
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:34.280]   So you have these anchors, but as you all know,
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:36.080]   the red that I'm seeing is not necessarily
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:36.920]   the red that you're seeing.
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:38.600]   We just both know to call that red.
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:40.360]   And since you say red and I say red,
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:42.240]   I think why we're seeing the same thing.
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:44.800]   But no, we're not seeing the same thing, right?
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:47.280]   And in odor, we don't have those anchors, right?
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:48.880]   We don't from childhood, you know,
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:50.520]   our mom doesn't tell us, so what's this smell
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:51.640]   and what's that smell, right?
[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:54.360]   And so we don't have these language anchors
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:57.760]   that make us think that we're perceiving the same thing.
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:00.600]   Now, how can you quantify that?
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:04.080]   The most important term in measuring sensory systems
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:05.760]   is similarity, right?
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:07.440]   That's the measure, right?
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:10.720]   So what can you, let's say we take 10 odorants
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:13.640]   and I have you rate all the pairwise similarities, right?
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:15.640]   So you'd end up with 45 numbers, right?
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:18.400]   So, you know, how similar is one to two, one to three,
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:19.400]   one to four, and then two,
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:22.400]   and all the possible pairwise similarities.
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:24.400]   Let's say you rate similarity from one,
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:27.800]   which is totally dissimilar to 100, exactly the same, right?
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:31.200]   So now I have a similarity matrix
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:34.240]   that describes Andrew's perception of smell, right?
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:36.560]   I have, you know, based on these 10 odorants
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:37.720]   that I selected.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:40.400]   Now I can run my similarity matrix
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:42.360]   and then I can see if the similarity matrix
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:43.560]   are correlated, right?
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:45.600]   And then we've gotten rid of the issue of names
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:46.440]   and orders, right?
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:48.840]   It doesn't matter if I'll call this lemon and this orange
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:52.640]   and you call this sweet potato and this marshmallow, right?
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:53.760]   It doesn't matter.
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:58.080]   If I think that these two are highly similar and you agree,
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.240]   and I think that these two are very different
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:01.480]   and you agree, right?
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:03.120]   We perceive the world in the same way.
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:06.240]   If our similarity matrices are aligned, right?
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:08.200]   And what's nice about that is that then you can do that
[02:51:08.200 --> 02:51:11.800]   for vision, audition, and all faction in a common group.
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:16.160]   And you can see where we're more alike each other or not.
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:19.080]   And we've done that for color vision, all faction,
[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:21.600]   and tonal audition, okay?
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:26.600]   And we are most dissimilar in color vision, okay?
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:31.240]   We're, in color vision, the variance is about 100%.
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:32.920]   - Amazing, that's quite different.
[02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:34.320]   - And there's tons of literature on this.
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:36.520]   Tons of it, tons of it, right?
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:40.040]   And in all faction and audition, they're about the same.
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:43.000]   So we're not different, we're very similar.
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.720]   We're just very poor at appreciating this.
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:48.680]   And mind you, not that there's not variability,
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:50.040]   there is variability.
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:52.080]   And of course, the system is malleable
[02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:53.400]   as all sensory systems are.
[02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:55.120]   So you can learn to like an order
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:57.800]   and that will change you and learn to dislike an order, right?
[02:51:57.800 --> 02:51:59.800]   But just the way you can learn to like a sound
[02:51:59.800 --> 02:52:01.040]   or dislike a sound.
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:04.000]   So this doesn't take away from the hardwired link
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:07.520]   of a structure to its perception that they're malleable.
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:12.520]   And we're not very variable, we're actually kind of similar.
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:16.480]   - That's a perfect segue to the question I have next,
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:19.560]   which is, if in general,
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:22.400]   people perceive certain odors similarly,
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:28.960]   you could imagine that odors could be manufactured,
[02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:33.160]   co-opted, et cetera, in order to elicit
[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:36.320]   richer sensory experiences and drive choice making.
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:41.520]   That's obvious at the level of the smell of a hot dog stand
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:43.440]   or freshly baked bread, et cetera.
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:45.200]   But what I'm talking about here,
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.520]   and I'd like to ask you about is doing this at scale
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:51.640]   and scientists, geeks like to say in silico,
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:52.600]   through computers.
[02:52:52.600 --> 02:52:54.880]   So for a long time now, there's been this idea
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:58.280]   that there will soon be Google smell,
[02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:00.280]   not to call out Google as the only search engine,
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:02.480]   but Duck Go smell,
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:03.960]   for those of you that don't want to hear smell--
[02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:05.280]   - Chat GPT.
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:07.480]   - Chat GPT and on and on.
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.840]   In other words, visual information is sent
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:15.360]   through computer interfaces as is auditory information,
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:19.520]   not so much haptic somatosensory, although it can,
[02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:22.400]   our lab uses VR, it can be done,
[02:53:22.400 --> 02:53:24.840]   but it hasn't really taken hold.
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:29.520]   However, smell being such a rich source of behavioral
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:34.520]   and hormonal and other sorts of deep, deep information
[02:53:34.520 --> 02:53:37.920]   that can drive people into yum, yuck or meh
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:42.200]   type decision making, seems like an amazing candidate.
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:46.640]   So what is your experience with generating smells
[02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:48.600]   in silico and computers?
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:50.320]   And here folks, for those of you that aren't catching
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:52.520]   on to this, and I don't expect that everyone would
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:55.440]   because what we're really alluding to here
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:57.840]   is the idea that you'll look at,
[02:53:57.840 --> 02:53:59.800]   you'll put into a search engine,
[02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:04.720]   a blueberry pancakes recipe and that not only will you
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:08.200]   get photos of those blueberry pancakes and a recipe,
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:11.640]   but you will get the hopefully validated odor
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:14.960]   of those pancakes and that recipe coming at you
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:18.520]   in real time through the computer.
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:23.280]   - So I'll start off answering from the name
[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:25.360]   you threw out there, Google.
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:29.040]   So about, probably about five years ago,
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:33.520]   Google had an April Fool's spoof.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:34.360]   - Oh, right.
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:38.080]   - And they put out this video of Google smell.
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:43.080]   Okay, and it had all these like classic like sales images
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:47.400]   of holding up your phone to a rose and it generating rose
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:50.680]   and all these things, right?
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:52.480]   So Google is now trying to do that.
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:58.640]   And they just published, I mean,
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:00.560]   I know they've been trying to do it for a while.
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:05.560]   They visited our lab, but they just sort of went public
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.000]   with this that really just like about a month ago
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:13.680]   or something that they have this offshoot startup.
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:16.400]   I think it's called Osmo or something like that
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:19.600]   that started off with a ridiculous sum of money
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:23.280]   for a startup like, I don't know, tons of money.
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:24.560]   - There's a lot of money in that world.
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:26.000]   - Yeah, in Google, yeah.
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:31.520]   - To digitize smell.
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:35.800]   And there are other companies
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:38.320]   that are trying to do this as well.
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:40.480]   And we've been talking now for quite a while
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:42.720]   about our labs chemo signaling work,
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:46.800]   but actually half of our lab is devoted to this question
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:50.280]   of ultimately digitizing smell.
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:56.400]   And so this is a very, very active field of research.
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:01.400]   And I'll say one thing that dovetails
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:04.520]   with what you were talking about before,
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.720]   in many ways, COVID is going to be one of the best things
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:11.200]   that ever happened to olfaction research.
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:14.880]   Because suddenly all the world is, or all the world,
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:19.440]   lots of people are very cognizant
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:22.960]   of the importance of smell and smells like way up there
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:25.240]   in people's awareness because of COVID.
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:29.240]   And this is driving a renaissance of olfaction research.
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:33.200]   And awareness to olfaction is something
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.240]   that's worth paying attention to.
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:40.600]   And our lab has been involved in this way,
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:42.000]   in this effort for a long time
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.960]   where the initial part of this effort
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:47.560]   is in fact to develop a set of rules
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:51.120]   that link odor structure to odor perception.
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.040]   That is, the going thing was that until recently,
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:57.480]   at least there was no scientist or perfumer for that matter
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:01.440]   who could look at the structure of a novel molecular mixture
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:04.720]   and predict for you how it will smell or smell something
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:07.640]   and tell you what molecular structure could or should be.
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:13.320]   So in contrast, let's say to trivial like color vision,
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:16.240]   let's say, so if you know what the wavelength of the light
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:18.600]   is, you more or less know what perceived color
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:19.420]   it's gonna be.
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:20.240]   Of course, there are exceptions to that
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.280]   and all sorts of issues, but as a rule, you would know.
[02:57:23.280 --> 02:57:26.480]   Or the other way around, you can generate a wavelength
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:28.680]   and you would know what color light
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:30.840]   it's going to be perceived.
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:34.880]   So that's an example of where the rules linking structure,
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:37.160]   in this case, measured by wavelength and perception,
[02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:39.480]   in this case, experienced this color,
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:41.040]   the rules are well-known.
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.300]   In olfaction, we didn't have that until recently.
[02:57:44.300 --> 02:57:47.120]   But over the past few years,
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:51.400]   a bunch of labs have really pushed this forward.
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:54.600]   There's a bunch of work out of Leslie Voshall's lab
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:57.780]   at Rockefeller and Andreas Keller working with Leslie,
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:02.680]   who've done a lot of work on this front.
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:06.960]   Also worked from Joel Mainland's lab at Monell
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:08.520]   and Fair Discovery.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:10.900]   Joel was a graduate student in our lab.
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:15.200]   And recently in our lab, we've had,
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:17.820]   and I hope this doesn't come across as overly arrogant,
[02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:21.880]   but we've had a sort of mini breakthrough on this front.
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:24.880]   - To call something a mini breakthrough is far from arrogant.
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:30.880]   - And this is a paper led by Aaron Ravia from our lab
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:34.280]   and Coby Snitz, also a major contributor there,
[02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:38.240]   a paper published in Nature about a year and a half ago
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:40.420]   in the height of a COVID pandemic.
[02:58:40.420 --> 02:58:42.400]   So nobody really, I won't say nobody,
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:44.040]   but it wasn't noticed in the way
[02:58:44.040 --> 02:58:44.980]   otherwise would have been.
[02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:48.200]   It was published in Nature really on like a week
[02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:51.980]   where the whole world was like going berserk over COVID.
[02:58:51.980 --> 02:58:57.560]   And in this paper, we develop an algorithmic framework
[02:58:57.560 --> 02:59:03.560]   where we can predict the perceptual similarity
[02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:07.300]   of any two molecular mixtures
[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:09.940]   with very, very high accuracy.
[02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:12.200]   So if you give me two molecular mixtures,
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:16.520]   I can predict how similar you will smell them to be, okay?
[02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:19.900]   Now, not only could we predict that, but we could design it.
[02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:24.900]   So we can generate mixtures with known similarities.
[02:59:24.900 --> 02:59:29.480]   And the result was highlighted,
[02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:32.380]   and you'll appreciate this coming from vision,
[02:59:32.380 --> 02:59:35.820]   is that using our algorithmic solution,
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:38.160]   we generated olfactory metamers.
[02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:42.400]   So we measured mixtures completely non-overlapping
[02:59:42.400 --> 02:59:44.360]   in their molecular structure,
[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:47.660]   but they smell exactly the same, okay?
[02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:50.000]   Now, if you would come to a classic perfumer
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.540]   or most classic perfumers and tell them
[02:59:52.540 --> 02:59:54.620]   that you can generate two mixtures
[02:59:54.620 --> 02:59:56.960]   with zero molecules in common,
[02:59:56.960 --> 03:00:00.620]   but smell exactly the same, they would tell you no.
[03:00:00.620 --> 03:00:04.400]   And yet we did, and anybody can recreate them.
[03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:05.820]   This is simple, actually.
[03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:09.520]   And in the paper, we do a few things,
[03:00:09.520 --> 03:00:13.280]   like we generate a metamer for a Chanel No. 5.
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:15.360]   So you don't like perfumes, so this one.
[03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:18.400]   But we take, so we generate a Chanel No. 5
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:21.980]   with no component from Chanel No. 5 in it, okay?
[03:00:21.980 --> 03:00:24.800]   And we actually have a publicly available website.
[03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:26.040]   I'll give it to you for your links.
[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:27.560]   If you want that anybody can do this,
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:31.680]   we built an engine that you can generate these metamers.
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:33.120]   Now, once we did that,
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:39.320]   in a way, we've generated the infrastructure
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:40.620]   for digitizing smell.
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:46.580]   Because, again, what our algorithm predicts,
[03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:49.460]   our framework predicts is similarity.
[03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:50.740]   But in a way, that's enough for you.
[03:00:50.740 --> 03:00:51.780]   Why is that enough?
[03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:56.660]   We have a map of 4,000 molecules.
[03:00:56.660 --> 03:01:00.580]   For each one, we know there are perceived smell.
[03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:03.060]   Now you can make up any mixture you want for me.
[03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:05.700]   I can project it into that map
[03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:07.740]   and measure its pairwise distance
[03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:09.300]   from all the points in the map.
[03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:10.980]   If it falls on lemon,
[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:13.120]   then what you generated smells like lemon.
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:15.120]   And if it falls on tomato,
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:17.480]   then what you generated smells like tomato.
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:20.440]   So we now solve that problem.
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:23.920]   We can predict the odor of any molecular mixture.
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:26.520]   We can see how it's going to smell.
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:29.400]   What we can do is then find a set of components,
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:31.680]   which we call odor primaries,
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:35.560]   that can be used to mix any odor that you can perceive.
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:39.560]   And that's what we're working on now.
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:42.240]   And about a month ago,
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:44.080]   so this is in collaboration with a lab
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:47.280]   of Jonathan Williams at Max Planck in Munich.
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:52.720]   Jonathan Williams is an atmospheric chemist,
[03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:55.240]   but he's really good at using GCMS,
[03:01:55.240 --> 03:01:57.540]   these tools that measure molecules.
[03:01:57.540 --> 03:02:02.420]   So Jonathan Williams measured odorants in Germany,
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:05.160]   transmitted the information to us over IP.
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:08.780]   We fed that into our algorithmic framework
[03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:12.480]   and recreated it from a device that mixes primaries.
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:16.360]   And we tried to do four different odorants
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:18.680]   in our proof of concept test.
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:22.460]   One of them was rose,
[03:02:22.460 --> 03:02:25.760]   and we failed at recreating rose.
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:27.880]   We in fact recreated something that had a precip,
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:30.040]   but most people perceived it as bubblegum.
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:33.800]   The second one we tried to do was anise,
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:36.480]   and we failed at recreating anise.
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:38.820]   And most people said it was cherry,
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:42.120]   which is not very far, but it failed.
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:44.640]   The third was gasoline.
[03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:48.640]   And we were slightly but significantly better than chance
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:50.220]   at recreating gasoline.
[03:02:50.220 --> 03:02:54.140]   And the fourth was violets.
[03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:57.560]   And 15 of 16 people said violets.
[03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:01.020]   So the first odor ever transmitted over IP is violets,
[03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:02.600]   and we did that last month.
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.680]   Of course, this is not anything near a practical solution.
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:14.160]   The device that Jonathan was using to measure
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:18.840]   is a $1.5 million device bigger than this table.
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:20.400]   - That's right, I remember when VCRs,
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:22.240]   half the audience won't even know what that is.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:25.460]   - The VCRs were like this big, so we're all good.
[03:03:25.460 --> 03:03:27.860]   I'm all good with the prediction
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:30.080]   that things will come down in size and cost.
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:31.660]   - Yeah, I was just saying,
[03:03:31.660 --> 03:03:33.680]   don't hold your breath for this to be
[03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:35.740]   on your table tomorrow.
[03:03:35.740 --> 03:03:39.960]   And again, all we have in hand
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:42.060]   is this very initial proof of concept.
[03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:46.260]   It's not even yet close to being a paper we are submitting
[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:48.500]   because there's still lots of work to be done.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:51.740]   But we're on the path.
[03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:56.300]   We're on the path, and Google will probably beat us to it.
[03:03:56.300 --> 03:03:57.140]   They got a lot more--
[03:03:57.140 --> 03:03:58.940]   - I don't know, you seem pretty dogged in there.
[03:03:58.940 --> 03:04:01.820]   - Yeah, but they have so much more resources
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:06.820]   that at this stage, and they've already published
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:10.060]   two papers from that effort that are good.
[03:04:10.060 --> 03:04:12.740]   Yeah, you know--
[03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:14.000]   - They definitely have a lot of dollars
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.980]   and a lot of people, a lot of good neuroscience
[03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:19.320]   and other biology, engineering,
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:20.840]   graduate students, and postdocs go there.
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:24.200]   But the real question is, are they getting the best people?
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:26.700]   Because as you and I both know in science,
[03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:30.020]   oftentimes it's small groups of the very best
[03:04:30.020 --> 03:04:33.380]   and most creative people that can outrun
[03:04:33.380 --> 03:04:34.940]   and outgun large groups.
[03:04:34.940 --> 03:04:37.920]   And here I don't have anything against Google, by the way.
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:39.540]   I use it all the time.
[03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:41.100]   - I'm not a betting man,
[03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:44.860]   but I would put my money on Google on this race.
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:48.220]   But I'll try and give them a run for their money.
[03:04:48.220 --> 03:04:49.060]   - There you go.
[03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:51.300]   - So since like most of us want to see the problem solved,
[03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:53.320]   regardless of who gets there first,
[03:04:53.320 --> 03:04:54.800]   what I'll say is you better get going, Google,
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:57.560]   'cause Noam's being, he's humble and he's dogged,
[03:04:57.560 --> 03:05:00.400]   so better get cracking.
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:01.980]   There, we just cost the weekends
[03:05:01.980 --> 03:05:05.040]   and broke up the relationships of a bunch of scientists.
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:06.680]   I remember when I was a graduate student at Berkeley,
[03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:09.880]   I remember hearing there was a guy in our common friend,
[03:05:09.880 --> 03:05:12.560]   Irving Zucker's lab that worked 100 hours a week.
[03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:14.680]   So I was like, oh, I'll work 102 hours a week,
[03:05:14.680 --> 03:05:16.400]   which was not a good choice.
[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:19.820]   In any case, it's abundantly clear
[03:05:19.820 --> 03:05:21.380]   that you're making progress here.
[03:05:21.380 --> 03:05:24.380]   And I go to some of the earlier discussions we had,
[03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:26.060]   and I think we're not just talking about
[03:05:26.060 --> 03:05:29.980]   transferring recipes and smells of food,
[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:33.580]   gasoline from the people watching the F1 race or something,
[03:05:33.580 --> 03:05:38.060]   but I'm thinking dating apps, I'm thinking you,
[03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:39.740]   nowadays everyone knows that when you travel
[03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:43.060]   and you want to see your family, your grandkids or kids,
[03:05:43.060 --> 03:05:46.480]   it's better to get on FaceTime and see them or Zoom
[03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:47.960]   than to just hear their voice.
[03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:49.760]   We're all talking about being able to smell them.
[03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:50.720]   - I'll tell you more than that.
[03:05:50.720 --> 03:05:51.640]   I'll tell you more than that.
[03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:56.640]   I mean, we're talking now of trying to achieve
[03:05:56.640 --> 03:06:01.960]   the olfactory equivalent of circa 1956 black and white TV,
[03:06:01.960 --> 03:06:03.760]   okay, basically, right?
[03:06:03.760 --> 03:06:05.960]   I mean, I'm not dreaming, let's say,
[03:06:05.960 --> 03:06:07.880]   of being able to transmit to you the difference
[03:06:07.880 --> 03:06:09.920]   between a Cabernet or a Merlot, right?
[03:06:09.920 --> 03:06:12.920]   But if I can generate something that's vaguely wine,
[03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:16.180]   that will be an amazing success from my perspective, right?
[03:06:16.180 --> 03:06:21.180]   But jump ahead in your imagination to 4K odor transmission,
[03:06:21.180 --> 03:06:26.220]   then medical diagnostics is what you want to be talking about
[03:06:26.220 --> 03:06:31.220]   because this is over extension,
[03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:36.740]   but you can almost say that every disease will have an odor.
[03:06:36.740 --> 03:06:40.000]   I mean, every disease is a specific metabolic process.
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:41.780]   Metabolic process have metabolites,
[03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:43.100]   metabolites have a smell.
[03:06:43.100 --> 03:06:49.780]   Olfaction, once it's digitized and high resolution,
[03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:52.600]   which again, in our hands, it's not gonna be,
[03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:54.920]   I mean, we're talking, you know, in my retirement,
[03:06:54.920 --> 03:06:57.480]   maybe I'll read about this one day if I'll still have vision.
[03:06:57.480 --> 03:07:00.200]   I mean, this is not close,
[03:07:00.200 --> 03:07:04.860]   but when olfaction digitization is brought
[03:07:04.860 --> 03:07:08.680]   to the equivalent of 4K of vision and audition
[03:07:08.680 --> 03:07:12.020]   you have now, then it will be in medical diagnosis.
[03:07:12.020 --> 03:07:16.060]   You'll have, excuse me for the imagery,
[03:07:16.060 --> 03:07:19.600]   but you will have an electronic nose in your bathroom,
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:21.760]   each one of us will have in the toilet,
[03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:24.980]   and it will be doing diagnostics all the time.
[03:07:24.980 --> 03:07:27.880]   And that's where it's gonna go.
[03:07:27.880 --> 03:07:32.880]   But again, not anywhere in the very close future.
[03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:37.180]   - Well, it's certainly an exciting proposition,
[03:07:37.180 --> 03:07:39.860]   and I'm delighted that you and other groups
[03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:41.520]   who are so strong are working on it.
[03:07:41.520 --> 03:07:42.540]   I really am.
[03:07:42.540 --> 03:07:47.600]   Noam, I wanna say thank you for your time today.
[03:07:47.600 --> 03:07:51.200]   First of all, this was a tremendously
[03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:52.560]   interesting conversation.
[03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:55.120]   I mean, we touched on so many things, hormones, smells,
[03:07:55.120 --> 03:07:57.360]   the architecture of the olfactory system.
[03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:59.860]   I know that people listening to this are realizing,
[03:07:59.860 --> 03:08:01.280]   but I'm gonna say it anyway,
[03:08:01.280 --> 03:08:04.560]   what an incredible gift you've given us
[03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:07.580]   as a expert in this field,
[03:08:07.580 --> 03:08:11.980]   giving us this tour of the work that you and others
[03:08:11.980 --> 03:08:15.260]   who you credit so generously have done
[03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:17.320]   to elucidate this incredible system
[03:08:17.320 --> 03:08:20.260]   that we call olfaction and chemosensation.
[03:08:20.260 --> 03:08:22.700]   Also, just for the incredibly pioneering work
[03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:23.540]   that you've done.
[03:08:23.540 --> 03:08:26.780]   You know, I don't have many heroes in science.
[03:08:26.780 --> 03:08:28.880]   I have heroes outside of science and a few in science,
[03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:32.620]   but I'm gonna purposely embarrass myself a little bit
[03:08:32.620 --> 03:08:35.680]   by saying that from the time I was at Berkeley
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:38.540]   and I then saw that experiment being done
[03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:41.620]   of people foraging falling scent trails.
[03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:44.760]   And then until I was a junior professor,
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:48.800]   I used that in my teaching slides in a class that I taught
[03:08:48.800 --> 03:08:50.800]   that was sort of the early origins of this podcast
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:51.640]   in many ways.
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:54.000]   And over and over again,
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.320]   when your laboratory publishes papers,
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:08:58.640]   I find like this is super interesting, super cool.
[03:08:58.640 --> 03:09:00.400]   And I find myself telling everybody about it.
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:03.280]   And that's really what I do for a living is I learn
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:05.320]   and then I blab about it to the world.
[03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:07.800]   So thank you so much for the work that you've done
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:09.000]   and the spirit that you bring to it.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:10.400]   Whatever drives that spirit,
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:13.760]   as the great late Ben Barres used to say, keep going,
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:16.240]   because we are all benefiting tremendously.
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:20.080]   And I also just wanna say that, you know,
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:21.640]   for people listening to this,
[03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:25.520]   that the spirit of science is one of, as you mentioned,
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:27.500]   there's complex politics and all these things,
[03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:30.660]   but it's absolutely clear that you delight in the work
[03:09:30.660 --> 03:09:31.500]   you do.
[03:09:31.500 --> 03:09:33.100]   And so I delight in it.
[03:09:33.100 --> 03:09:34.100]   I'm grateful for it.
[03:09:34.100 --> 03:09:35.500]   I'm grateful for your time today.
[03:09:35.500 --> 03:09:37.820]   And so on behalf of me and many,
[03:09:37.820 --> 03:09:38.880]   many people listening to this,
[03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:41.340]   I just wanna extend a huge debt of gratitude.
[03:09:41.340 --> 03:09:43.100]   Thank you so much.
[03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:46.580]   - So I'm blushing.
[03:09:46.580 --> 03:09:48.020]   I don't know if this doesn't come across
[03:09:48.020 --> 03:09:49.740]   on the radio podcast,
[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:52.820]   but thank you so much for very warm words.
[03:09:52.820 --> 03:09:55.900]   I mean, you know, as you know,
[03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:58.940]   when you work in your lab,
[03:09:58.940 --> 03:10:01.860]   you don't, there's these moments
[03:10:01.860 --> 03:10:05.180]   where you suddenly discover that somebody is like,
[03:10:05.180 --> 03:10:06.340]   cares a bit about it.
[03:10:06.340 --> 03:10:08.700]   And those are always very rewarding moments
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:11.420]   because usually you function without that.
[03:10:11.420 --> 03:10:13.860]   I mean, I guess that's one of the things you need
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:17.020]   to be a scientist is to have the, you know,
[03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:21.860]   the drive to work without that because it comes only rarely.
[03:10:21.860 --> 03:10:24.020]   - There's immense gratitude and appreciation for you
[03:10:24.020 --> 03:10:25.380]   and what you do from me.
[03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:29.340]   And now I know from a large segment of the world as well.
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:31.660]   So my only request is that you come back
[03:10:31.660 --> 03:10:33.540]   and tell us about the next results.
[03:10:33.540 --> 03:10:35.620]   Sometime not too long from now.
[03:10:35.620 --> 03:10:37.940]   - Yeah, well, I'm gonna catch you live now,
[03:10:37.940 --> 03:10:39.900]   although you have the power to edit this.
[03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:41.260]   I guess that's not fair.
[03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:44.100]   But first you come visit us in Israel
[03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:46.780]   and tell us both about the science
[03:10:46.780 --> 03:10:48.300]   and the public science work you're doing.
[03:10:48.300 --> 03:10:49.580]   And then I'll come again.
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:53.460]   - Good bargain and I accept, delighted.
[03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:54.380]   Thank you so much.
[03:10:54.380 --> 03:10:55.460]   - Yeah, pleasure.
[03:10:55.460 --> 03:10:57.260]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:10:57.260 --> 03:11:01.140]   about olfaction and chemosensation with Dr. Noam Sobel.
[03:11:01.140 --> 03:11:02.400]   If you'd like to learn more about the work
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:05.620]   in the Sobel Laboratory or read some of the papers described
[03:11:05.620 --> 03:11:08.580]   during today's episode, as well as learn about the current
[03:11:08.580 --> 03:11:10.900]   and future projects in the Sobel Laboratory,

[03:11:44.540 --> 03:11:46.220]   Not so much on today's episode,
[03:11:46.220 --> 03:11:48.600]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:50.060]   we discuss supplements.
[03:11:50.060 --> 03:11:52.200]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:54.280]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:55.840]   for things like improving their sleep,
[03:11:55.840 --> 03:11:57.960]   their focus, and hormone support.
[03:11:57.960 --> 03:11:59.960]   The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to have partnered
[03:11:59.960 --> 03:12:01.380]   with Momentous Supplements.
[03:12:01.380 --> 03:12:02.960]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:04.380]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:12:04.380 --> 03:12:06.880]   please go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.

[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:42.160]   or protocols for things like enhancing sleep,
[03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:46.120]   for exercise, for meditation, for dopamine, for focus,
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:47.440]   and many other topics.

[03:13:01.020 --> 03:13:02.560]   Once again, I'd like to thank you for joining me
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:05.740]   for today's discussion about olfaction and chemosensation
[03:13:05.740 --> 03:13:07.280]   with Dr. Noam Sobel.
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:09.420]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:13:09.420 --> 03:13:11.120]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:13.700]   [upbeat music]
[03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:16.280]   (upbeat music)
