[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.140]   forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.700]   do you think they're more likely to be friendly,
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.780]   to befriend us or to destroy us?
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.680]   - Well, I think for the most part,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.980]   they'll pretty much ignore us.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.040]   If you were a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.600]   Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.520]   Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.160]   Well, the guy with a briefcase could be a developer
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.520]   about to basically flatten the entire forest,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.320]   destroying your livelihood.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.820]   So instinctively, you may be afraid of the hunter,
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.440]   but actually the problem with deers in the forest
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.280]   is that they should fear developers
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.320]   because developers look at deer
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.720]   as simply getting in the way.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   I mean, in "War of the Worlds" by H.G. Wells,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.880]   the aliens did not hate us.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.080]   If you read the book,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.240]   the aliens did not have evil intentions
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.700]   toward homo sapiens, no, we were in the way.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.200]   So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.620]   may view us quite differently
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.400]   than in science fiction novels.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.100]   However, I personally believe,
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.880]   and I cannot prove any of this,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.300]   I personally believe that they're probably
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.920]   gonna be peaceful because there's nothing
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.080]   that they want from our world.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.620]   I mean, what are they gonna take us?
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.660]   What are they gonna take us for, gold?
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.680]   No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.720]   It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.740]   but that only affects homo sapiens.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.880]   Squirrels don't care about gold.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.680]   And so gold is a rather useless element.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.240]   Rare earths, maybe, platinum-based elements,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.800]   rare earths for their electronics, yeah, maybe.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.380]   But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.720]   I mean, think about it for a moment.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.660]   People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.320]   but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.440]   absolutely nothing.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.920]   I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.880]   I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.960]   there's an alien writing down that very same equation
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.320]   in different notation, but that alien on the other side
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.440]   of the galaxy, Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.040]   it would mean nothing to him or her or it.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:43.020]   [ Silence ]
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:53.000]   [ Silence ]
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
