[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   Let's do a call.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.840]   Okay, sounds good.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.240]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.160]   My question today is very simple.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.760]   Where can we find more real world examples of people living the deep life?
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.440]   I think the case studies are often really good at illustrating very abstract concepts
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.440]   like the deep life.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   After all, it's much easier to understand radical alignment with your values when you
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.520]   read the story of the triathlete who left New York and moved to Boulder to train and
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520]   be close to his family.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.440]   I know you try to share as much cases as you can on the podcast, and I'm assuming your
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.680]   upcoming book will have several cases that illustrate these different moves.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.960]   But even then, that's only a handful of examples.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.320]   Some of them are also hard to relate.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.560]   I mean, not everyone wants to move to the mountains to be a world-class triathlete or
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.760]   move to a cabin to be a writer.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.800]   I know from experience that sometimes all it takes to crack in your own deep life is
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   seeing someone else's life that really resonates.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.480]   So here's a final provocation.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.320]   If there isn't such resource, should someone build one?
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.800]   Thanks for your tremendous generosity of spirit and sharing your work so broadly, Cal.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   Thank you.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.400]   Well, John, you're hitting on a couple of good points here.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.880]   Let's start with your last point first.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.080]   Should there be a better resource for encountering examples of the deep life so that you have
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.800]   a better chance of hitting one that resonates with you in particular?
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.160]   And I agree with your premise here that somehow or sometimes getting the specifics, this specific
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.600]   person did something that resonates exactly with me, is critical for making a vision for
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   your own life.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.160]   Yes, I think there should be a resource like that.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.800]   I actually have this idea.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.420]   I'll have to figure out when and how I'll have the time to do this.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.000]   But I've had this idea, and I've talked to Jesse about this before, of a podcast called
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.820]   The Deep Life.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.200]   And all it is, is each week an interview with someone who lives a deep life.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.760]   And so you just get this real variety of it.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.680]   Now, in a perfect world where time and money was not an issue, it would be really cool
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.140]   if you could edit a podcast like this NPR style.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.680]   So it's not just straight, let's talk to you for 45 minutes, but there's different segments
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.160]   of conversation with musical interlude and moments of expository narration from me.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.280]   I think it'd be a really cool show.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.320]   I mentioned something like that in my proposal for The Deep Life book, that maybe as I start
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.000]   working on that book, I might launch something like that.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.100]   So I think that's a good idea.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.400]   But let's talk about the broader point here about resonance and deep life case studies.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.620]   Here is the reality/issue with the deep life as a concept.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.760]   We know it when we see it, right?
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.660]   So we all have this instinct, you read a book, you see something on a documentary, you see
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.160]   an Instagram something, I don't know the terminology, whatever they call it, an Instagram video
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.640]   bundle, whatever the terminology is, of someone doing triathlon training in Boulder, and it
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.840]   just hits a chord and it's boom.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   That's what I, there's something about that life that's right and my life is not there.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.080]   So we know it when we see it.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.360]   And starting with the pandemic, I think a lot more people than ever before are noticing
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.480]   that reaction and are very interested in this idea about the deep life.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.800]   The issue is that it's hard to pin down.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.060]   And then you look to your own life and you say, I just have this deep instinctual feeling
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.160]   that what I'm doing here is not everything it could be.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   And there's these other people I see and hear about, and that resonates, they're doing something
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.720]   that I crave, but I can't pin down exactly what it is.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.240]   Like I don't know why this guy who moved to Boulder to train for triathlons, this really
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.920]   resonates with me, but I don't do triathlons.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.240]   I don't want to move to Boulder, but something about that still resonates.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   What is it that resonates with me?
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.900]   And what does that tell me for my own life and what type of changes I should make?
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.560]   This is the real issue, the gap between instinct and pragmatism when it comes to this concept
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.460]   of the deep life.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.960]   So part of what I've been trying to do on the show, but I'm doing much more carefully,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.440]   I'll do much more formally when I eventually write the deep life book is to make the concept
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.800]   concrete.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   What are the attributes that define a deep life?
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.240]   Generally speaking, I'm not talking about particular activities.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.020]   You have to be in Boulder, you have to be running triathlon, but what is it specifically
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.720]   that separates what we would instinctually see as a deep life from a normal life?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.580]   Once we have identified what those properties are, does that mean we can have a more systematic
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.260]   approach to acquiring those in our life if that's what we're interested in?
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.020]   That's what I'm gonna be trying to do with my deep life book when I get to it.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.340]   There's a systematic quest for more.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.980]   Let's pin down the definition.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.720]   These are the properties that separate what resonates as a deep life from others.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.580]   Here is how you would actually go and acquire those properties.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.900]   So it's a deep question, John, and one I'm going to continue to work on.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.860]   Let me give you a one only partially formed idea right now.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.900]   Let's just give an appetizer for the larger banquet the one day come.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.060]   I'm toying with this notion.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.380]   This is my proposal for the deep life book.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.780]   That perhaps at the core of what separates a deep life from another life is the radical
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.940]   alignment of your existence to things that you value.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.300]   So there's two aspects, and this is a preliminary definition, but there's two aspects to this
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.380]   definition.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.860]   One that you are making changes to align your life closer with certain things that you really
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.940]   value and two that those realignment is radical.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.260]   So it's not just, I think I really value being outdoors and exercise.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.700]   So I'm going to start training every morning before I go to my standard 45 minute away
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.460]   commute government job from the DC suburbs.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.100]   That's an alignment of your life towards something that you value, but it's not a radical alignment.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.260]   The radical alignment is like, okay, I'm going to, it's going to be rich role.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.580]   Yes, I'm going to make training a big part of my life.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.500]   I'm going to leave my law firm and be a full time ultra athlete.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.580]   I'm going to move the boulder to be a triathlon.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.580]   Why does that resonate?
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.100]   Because they're not just making a change to align their life with something they care
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.100]   about.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.100]   It is a radical change.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.000]   They significantly change their job setup, their location, where they live, how they
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.140]   actually spend their days.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.620]   I'm increasingly convinced those are the two things you need.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.660]   If you miss any one of those two things, you run into trouble.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.980]   So if you make a radical change, but it's not aligned with something that's really important
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.540]   or that you really value, you end up, which we saw a lot of during the pandemic, making
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.300]   changes for the sake of change, trying to extract some sense of excitement or interesting
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.300]   this just because you did something radical, but then you get to the small farm that you
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.840]   just bought in the Hudson river Valley and realize, uh, I don't like farming.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.420]   It's weird and quiet out here.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.040]   I can't get good coffee.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.440]   This is, this is terrible.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.100]   This is actually not nothing here aligns with something I deeply value.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.420]   That's a problem.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.740]   Similarly, I think is if you're really clear on what you care about, but your change is
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.260]   too small, it's not radical.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.260]   It's nice.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.900]   It's better than not doing it, but it's not going to give you that deep residence of the
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   deep life.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:29.060]   It's the, the difference between, you know, Bill McKibben leaving the New Yorker to move
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:35.020]   to that small house up in the Adirondacks, the rightful time about nature and Bill McKibben
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.260]   saying, uh, on the side with my New Yorker job, I want to be working on a book about
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.300]   nature and go to a retreat once a year.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.820]   So the radicalness matters too.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.740]   So that's one of the ideas I'm working on, John.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.580]   I think maybe you need both those things.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.160]   The radicalness unlock some sense of, I really do care about this.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.460]   It's a real engine of motivation, but figuring out what you care about and making the right
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.460]   choice.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.860]   Like this is, this actually is important in believing it's important to you.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.020]   That's important too.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.740]   So probably those two pieces, those two pieces have to come together, but I think we're going
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.380]   to see a lot more of that in the near future.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:14.260]   And for a while going forward, people's willing to make radical changes to do radical realignments.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.180]   I think we're, we've woken up a little bit that we have more options than we think.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.460]   And there's more things we could be doing with our lives to make it interesting.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.700]   What about in cases where somebody like a case study where somebody already kind of
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.380]   has a deep life, do you think it needs to be as radical or do you think it just needs,
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   there's like different tiers?
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.980]   I just think there's usually, there's usually an aspect of radicalness to it.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:43.180]   By which I mean, there's just a, a part of their life that is unusually constructed or
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.260]   oriented to promote something that they care about.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.300]   I think the good life is different than the deep life.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.900]   I think you could have a good life.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.420]   Like I'm, I'm plugged into my community.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.980]   I appreciate my work.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.060]   I'm in good shape.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:02.860]   I enjoy, you know, uh, fine wine and like, and have a good life, capital G, good life,
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.020]   virtuous, ethical, uh, meaningful.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.540]   The deep life is a subset of that.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.860]   And it's not like everyone needs to do that, but some people really have this craving of,
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.180]   of, I want something about my life to be notable or remarkable in the literal sense where people
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.700]   are like, wow, do you know what Jesse's up to?
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.700]   That's really interesting.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700]   Like living on a boat or something.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.700]   You live in on a boat.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.700]   So do you, is that something you strive for or do you think you have that or do you think
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.380]   you're just living a good life?
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.500]   I'm like halfway there.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.020]   So do you want to do something radical?
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.020]   Maybe I do.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.540]   We're going to podcast from a boat.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.060]   I'm going to train for triathlons in Boulder.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.860]   Um, no, I, I do.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.580]   Um, I have ideas about specifically your life.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.980]   Well, I figure I'm going to be writing a book about the deep life.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:59.580]   Uh, it would be cool if that book could be structured around me doing some things.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.580]   I don't know.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.580]   I even put that on my proposal.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.580]   Like, I don't know what these would be, but I would like the book to have a pretty good
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.780]   degree of, of self discovery and reporting.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   For sure.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   The book is going to be very journalistic.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.140]   So in maybe a Michael Pollan style, it's me on the road doing things with people.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.340]   That's a different style than my norm.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.420]   My books up to now, including slow productivity is less first-person journalistic.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.420]   So good.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.100]   They can't ignore you had some first-person journalism in it for sure.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:33.460]   But since then I have, I've, uh, my, my, my structure is usually non first-person journalistic.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.420]   It's more reporting on ideas and laying out frameworks.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:43.900]   There's a little bit of first-person, I guess, in, in digital minimalism too, but the deep
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:51.740]   life is no, no, it's Michael Pollan goes to polyphase farms and is there with Salitan
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.220]   working on the mobile chicken coops.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.220]   You know, he goes to the places and does the things.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.700]   And so deep life is going to have that personal thread.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:06.860]   And I would like to have a prologue and epilogue is built around, um, some sort of deep change.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.980]   So we'll see, you know what I should, here's, here's what it is.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.300]   I'll, I'll, I'll give the preview.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.500]   This is actually, it's a joke, but, um, I was watching on my, uh, iPad the other day,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.500]   the North men.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.660]   Have you heard of this movie?
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.660]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.660]   I just read about it.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:29.300]   It's like, uh, the directors it's like, it's really detailed and it's a, it's a Viking
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.060]   movie, but like real Viking, New Yorker, I think.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.780]   Oh, I missed that.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.300]   Well anyways, um, so I finally watched it or I'm watching it.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   It's Viking.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   It's like a Viking myth.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.900]   So it, it did the witch movie too.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.900]   Oh, it's the same guy.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.900]   Oh yeah.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.900]   There was an article in the New Yorker, but I just read it.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.900]   Oh, maybe I did read that.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.900]   Did he do that?
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.900]   Uh, yes.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.900]   I like that guy.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.900]   Have you seen the witch?
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.380]   I, I was reading it.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.220]   I was like, I don't know if I saw, I don't think I did.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.220]   I need to watch it.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.220]   I love those movies.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.340]   I love those type of movies.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.300]   The wit because it's like low budget.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.900]   It just says it's a, here's this little village.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.060]   It's like three houses in 1600s, you know?
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.720]   So it's just one place.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.940]   It's not a $50 million budget.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.940]   That's a cool movie.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.980]   I mean, it's just like, what if like, you know, the witch that period with the witch trials
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.060]   and everything, like what if there was actually witches in colonial New England?
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.900]   Uh, my wife was watching it at some point they're grinding up babies to make this so
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.100]   their broom can fly or something.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.260]   And she was done with that.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.620]   Anyways, this is all, all to say, this is a very roundabout way that they get to.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.740]   So this is a Viking movie that stars Alex or Alexander Skarsgard.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.780]   People might know from true blood and some other things.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.780]   He's six, four, right?
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.260]   He's a six, four kind of Viking guy.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.740]   He got stacked for this movie, right?
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.740]   Like because he's plays a Viking berserker and he's 45.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.860]   So he's five years older and got, uh, just, you know, they, they had to make them sort
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   of kind of superhero.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.140]   They didn't cut them as much because they're trying to be pretty accurate.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.760]   So it wasn't marvel-y right.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.100]   Because a Viking wouldn't be super cut, but just like what he did with his traps or whatever.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.420]   So I was joking with my wife.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.900]   I was like that, this is what I'm going to focus all my time on.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.400]   If he could do that at 45, I'm just going to dedicate all of my time to becoming stacked
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.740]   like a Viking, just sort of apropos of nothing.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.100]   It took him six, uh, six months.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.100]   That would take a lot of time.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.700]   That would take away from your writing.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.700]   He did it.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.020]   So I went down this rabbit hole hour a day, six days a week.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.020]   It would take more than that.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.020]   It got real, real jacked.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.500]   It would take at least two hours a day.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.340]   Well, here's the, here's the curve ball in 2019.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.340]   He was in Tarzan.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.340]   Right.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.700]   So I just probably, which he had to get cut for.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.100]   So there's probably some, he wasn't, let's just say he wasn't starting.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.620]   Well, you already work out for at least 25 to 30 minutes a day, right?
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.620]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.620]   It was an hour a day.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.380]   I think it was an Icelandic, might've been an Icelandic trainer.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:04.500]   And they had the philosophy, but Sarsgar is a beast, like laser focus method type guy.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   So it was an intense hour.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.540]   They do just one muscle group per day until it's just basically destroyed.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.940]   And then, uh, a different muscle group, the next day, different muscle group the next
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.940]   day.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.300]   Um, but you know how much he had to eat?
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.780]   4,000 calories, 7,000 calories a day.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.100]   It's a lot of muscle, right?
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.420]   He put on 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.260]   7,000 calories a day.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.980]   And from what I understand, it's not like, yay, let's go get some burgers.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.020]   No, no, that's 7,000 calories.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.580]   Chicken, broccoli, and rice.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.140]   But anyways, uh, that's all to say, John, that this is my deep life goal is that I'm
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:48.820]   just going to spend years becoming like a, like a inappropriately stacked looking Viking.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.060]   That would be pretty cool.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.900]   You'd be able to hit those rowing times very easily.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.900]   I wish I didn't just row.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.420]   I just be stacked like a Viking and row, uh, and dress like a Viking all the time.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.220]   [MUSIC]
