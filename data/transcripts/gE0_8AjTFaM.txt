[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.100]   Hello everybody and welcome.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.980]   I want to thank all of you
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.320]   premium Huberman Lab Podcast subscribers for joining.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.440]   This is an exciting one,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.000]   even though the backdrop here looks very much
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.980]   like the studio back in the United States.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.980]   I am doing this AMA live from Sydney, Australia.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.540]   Where I and the Huberman Lab Podcast team have been
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.720]   for well over a week.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   We were in Melbourne
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.140]   and we just did two live shows here in Sydney
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.820]   and we're headed off to Brisbane tomorrow.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.140]   And it's been absolutely delightful.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.700]   We've had so much fun talking science,
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.660]   learning from people, and it's a wonderful place.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.620]   I want to get right into your questions
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.920]   and do my best to answer as many of them as possible,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.840]   as thoroughly, clearly, and succinctly as possible
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.500]   over the next hour.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.580]   So I'm going to dive into those in just a moment.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.900]   Just one last important thing before I do that,
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600]   which is that I want to thank everyone
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.580]   for being a premium subscriber
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.740]   and let you know that we,
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.140]   based on your contributions to the premium channel,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.600]   have already, as you know, supported four laboratories
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.740]   at Stanford, Columbia University, Salk Institute,
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.660]   and elsewhere for important projects on humans
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.540]   that are already leading to important
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020]   therapeutic breakthroughs that we will soon share with you
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.900]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.280]   But that this year, 2024,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.620]   we were fortunate enough to secure
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.060]   no fewer than three dollar for dollar match donors
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.460]   who have generously agreed to match our contributions
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.040]   from the premium channel to additional projects.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.720]   Those are going to head out
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.740]   to a number of different universities
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.320]   and researchers working, again, on human studies,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.880]   so no animal studies, human studies on important projects,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.400]   everything from novel treatments for mental health issues,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   headache and migraine,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.980]   some interesting stuff on immunology and cancer,
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.320]   mindsets and immune system function,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.920]   and much, much more also nutrition,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.860]   physiology, exercise physiology, et cetera.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.900]   So your contributions to the premium channel
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.240]   really do make a difference.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.200]   I can say this because I'm familiar with the challenges
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800]   of raising funding for doing truly breakthrough work
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.120]   and getting things quickly out to the general public.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.760]   So thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.360]   And now without further ado, let's get to your questions.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.080]   The first question was, is how are you managing
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.240]   to achieve your key health pillars while in Australia
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.520]   and any other place you've enjoyed doing so,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760]   all while working so hard?
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.740]   Well, thanks for the question.
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.240]   I'll answer this question in the context
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   of what I think we all can and should and really will do,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.000]   because if you're a premium channel subscriber,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.320]   certainly you're taking your health seriously.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.080]   So first off, I think there's a bit of a misconception
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   about the protocols on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.380]   being that we are all, including myself,
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.640]   super, super regimented about them to the point
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.220]   where we don't enjoy other things in life,
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.860]   and that's simply not true.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.500]   So I view the protocols of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.000]   as science-based, actionable, low cost, zero cost,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.120]   minimal cost in almost all situations.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.700]   There are a few exceptions to that,
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.780]   but they're really designed to mesh with the rest of life
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.600]   and enhance mental health and physical health,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.640]   which of course means remaining social,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.180]   staying on typical sleep schedules, et cetera.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.200]   So the big ones for me when arriving here
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.280]   were of course to get morning sunlight as often as possible.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.560]   We saw a beautiful sunrise this morning over Sydney,
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.720]   but even on the overcast days,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.120]   we've had a few rainy overcast days
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.640]   to really make it a point to get outside
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.140]   and to get that morning sunlight.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.800]   Also, our crew did travel in with a red light,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.200]   not a red light panel,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.120]   although I do have a couple of red light panels,
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.520]   those little portable ones that I use from time to time.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.640]   The red lights I'm referring to
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.240]   in reference to answering this question are the red lights,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.840]   which are just red light bulb that we,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.740]   I actually travel with a little red light bulb unit.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.800]   It's just like a small screwing unit.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.160]   You plug it in here with an adapter, of course,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   and then in the evening,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.200]   we've switched off the lights
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.400]   in the place where we're staying,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.240]   and it just brings the overall levels of cortisol down low
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.100]   very quickly, and it makes it very easy
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.820]   to get to sleep each night.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.240]   It makes a big, big difference,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.400]   and this is a very low cost tool.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.100]   You could essentially purchase any red light,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.940]   even red party lights, and put those up,
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.760]   and then switch off the regular overhead lights.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.380]   It makes a big difference,
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.180]   and it's probably even cost saving.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.860]   We've also stayed fairly regimented about exercise.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.160]   So this morning, took a great jog down to the ocean,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.000]   jumped in the ocean.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.760]   If you don't have access to an ocean on vacation,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.520]   just getting outside and getting some movement
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.660]   early in the day can help shift your rhythm.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.400]   Really the quadfecta of shifting your circadian rhythm
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.740]   in a new place or becoming an early riser
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.280]   if you want to do that is morning sunlight movement,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.400]   social engagement, and in my case, caffeine.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   Although some people would opt for eating breakfast,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   I just happen to prefer to eat
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.400]   a little bit later in the day.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.800]   So when you combine those things,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.400]   you are really amplifying that morning cortisol increase
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.080]   that I've talked about on the podcast,
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.480]   morning catecholamine release,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.840]   so dopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.480]   and those act in synergy to create more early day
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   and daytime mood focus and alertness
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   and enhance the transition to nighttime sleep.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.500]   But of course, that dimming of the lights
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.680]   and maybe even red light in the evening
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.120]   really, really can help.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.360]   And so those are the biggies.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.200]   And then of course,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.000]   if you want to shift your circadian rhythm really quickly
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.860]   to be on a local schedule,
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.600]   it helps to hop on the local meal schedule.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.400]   But for me, that always means skipping breakfast.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.480]   I'm not a big breakfast eater.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.460]   I like lunch and afternoon snacks sometimes and dinner.
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.360]   So when you do all of those things,
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.440]   makes it very easy to stay with the health pillars.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.560]   And of course, stress control is important.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.240]   We're doing lives, there's a lot of work to do.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.900]   So there's a daily for me,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.880]   non-sleep deep rest or yoga nidra protocol.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.360]   By the way, you may be familiar with non-sleep deep rest
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.480]   and yoga nidra, terrific zero cost practice
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.760]   for reducing stress, replacing or replenishing dopamine
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.360]   and mental and physical vigor.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.600]   I've talked about this in the studies
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.480]   that support this on the podcast.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.680]   There's a Huberman NSDR script on YouTube
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.120]   that's again, zero cost.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.640]   But while down here, we recorded a 10 minute,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.160]   20 minute and 30 minute NSDR script
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.360]   with a view of a beautiful Sydney sunrise.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.980]   Those should be posted to our Huberman Lab Clips channel
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.320]   in the not too distant future,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.440]   probably in the next couple of weeks.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.840]   And then you can have different duration NSDR scripts
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.640]   that you can use, again, completely zero cost
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.280]   anytime you like.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.820]   We've recorded also some additional meditations
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.580]   and we're considering putting out a Spotify album,
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.500]   if you will, of NSDR and meditations
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.700]   that are science-based of different duration.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.900]   So if you like that idea,
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.220]   maybe just give a shout into the internet
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.160]   and hopefully we'll hear it
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.840]   or put a comment on the latest episode
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.500]   of the Huberman Lab podcast on YouTube.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.360]   And if that sounds like a good idea to you,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.540]   we will do more of that.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.440]   These are again, zero cost, zero to access tools
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.520]   for enhancing mental health and physical health.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   So combining all of those is really what we've done.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.040]   Next question was, is I have followed your sleep advice
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.860]   and I have seen a huge improvement.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.660]   Great, happy to hear that.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.220]   Wonderful.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.300]   But I still wake up at night
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.500]   and only get five or six hours.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.340]   Is that enough?
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.100]   Can you please give more advice if possible?
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.020]   Well, first of all, thanks for tuning into the sleep advice.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.020]   So the question of whether or not five or six hours
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.720]   is enough really depends on person context.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.620]   And by context, I mean, it can even change
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.260]   across the course of the year by life circumstances.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.080]   The criteria for insomnia are very clear.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.220]   Insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.840]   due to lack of sleep at night.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.420]   Excessive daytime sleepiness due to lack of sleep at night.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.400]   So if you're not falling asleep during the day
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.060]   or you feel reasonably good throughout the day,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.500]   maybe only need a brief 10 minute to 30 minute nap
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.740]   in the afternoon, some people nap,
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.220]   some people don't like to nap, doesn't matter.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.660]   But if you feel pretty good throughout the day
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.600]   and you have enough mental and physical energy
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.340]   and focus to complete the activities
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.480]   that you need to complete,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.620]   then I wouldn't worry so much about five to six hours.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.500]   And I wouldn't obsess over these kind of scary things
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.520]   that we hear, oh, if we're not getting seven to eight hours
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.080]   that we get dementia, et cetera,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.360]   because that's not necessarily the case.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.580]   Everyone has different sleep needs.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.600]   The other thing, and this is perhaps the most important thing
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.200]   for everybody listening to this really to think about
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   is QQRT, which is quality, quantity, timing,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.820]   excuse me, quality, quantity, regularity, and timing.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.820]   QQRT, QQRT, which is an acronym coined
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.960]   by the great Matt Walker, author of the book,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.800]   "Why We Sleep."
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.880]   He has our own terrific podcast in his own right.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   He has a series on the human lab podcast coming out soon.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.560]   QQRT is what you really need to think about
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   when you think about your sleep.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.960]   So you want to think about the quantity.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.800]   How much are you getting?
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.780]   Well, you Rima, who asked this question,
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.480]   are getting five to six hours a night.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.220]   Okay, what about the quality of that sleep?
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.340]   Is it consistently five to six hours with no breaks
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.360]   or is there a break in the middle?
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.080]   One trip to the restroom in the middle of the night
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.440]   is considered normal and healthy for most people.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.980]   If you're making multiple trips to the restroom
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.080]   in the middle of the night,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.720]   you're waking up multiple times throughout the night
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.680]   on a regular basis, that's something to try and overcome.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.920]   So the quality piece is important.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.040]   Also, whether or not you remember your dreams or you don't,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.140]   you want to make sure that you're getting ample amounts
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.300]   of slow wave sleep, which dominates the first half
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.560]   of your sleep night and rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   which dominates the second half of your sleep night
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.260]   because they have different roles in recovery
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.480]   of brain and body, namely slow wave,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   AKA deep sleep is responsible for growth hormone release,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.960]   rapid eye movement sleep responsible for the unpacking
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.120]   or the uncoupling of emotions to prior day
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.040]   and previous day experiences.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.800]   And in that way acts as a kind of a scrubbing out
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.140]   or a therapy for your emotional state.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.200]   So are you feeling emotionally rested when you wake up
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.840]   is a good indication of whether or not
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.440]   you're getting enough rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.480]   Some people like sleep trackers using their aid sleep
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.720]   or their whoop or their aura ring or something like that.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.300]   I'm a fan of sleep trackers,
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.740]   but I think that relying too heavily on sleep scores
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.600]   can be risky.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.320]   There are data from Ali Krum's lab at Stanford
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.680]   showing that if people receive a poor sleep score,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.000]   even though they sleep well, their performance will drop.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.840]   If people get a good sleep score,
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.580]   even though their sleep was lousy,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.600]   their performance is maintained or even enhanced.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.280]   So you don't want to take any one sleep score
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.320]   and over-interpret it.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.000]   You want to look at the average
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.280]   and compare that to your subjective experience of sleep.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.600]   Maybe I would say go about halfway through your day
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.000]   if you can bear to do it before looking at your sleep score
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.960]   and see how you feel, then look at your sleep score
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.200]   as opposed to the other way around.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.800]   That might be a good way to adjust for that belief effect
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.920]   I just mentioned.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.400]   But if you're getting enough quantity,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.100]   let's say you get five to six hours
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.720]   and quality you're sleeping through that bout,
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.820]   maybe with one epoch of waking up.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.560]   And then the regularity of your sleep
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.600]   is that you're going to sleep
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.200]   more or less at the same time each night,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.700]   plus or minus an hour on let's say five to six days per week,
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.200]   because sometimes we like to stay up on a weekend night
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.920]   and have some fun or something like that.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.960]   And then the timing, where that sleep is falling
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.060]   in your 24 hour schedule is really key.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.880]   And here's what we're learning as a field,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.440]   that for many people who are early to bed,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.160]   early to rise types, if they go to bed around 9 p.m., 9.30,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.980]   and they only get six hours of sleep, they feel great.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.960]   Whereas if they get the equivalent amount of sleep,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.800]   but go to bed at 11 p.m. or midnight, they feel lousy.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.220]   Similarly, if you're a night owl,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.780]   you're somebody that really prefers to go to bed
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.220]   around one or 2 a.m. and wake up around, let's say 10 a.m.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.240]   If you take that equivalent amount of sleep
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.120]   and you go to bed earlier, you're going to feel not so good.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   So getting the timing of your sleep
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.220]   in the 24 hour cycle correct and fairly consistent,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.740]   that's the R part of QQRT correct, is going to be beneficial.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.520]   So I wouldn't worry so much about five to six hours only.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.500]   Here's what I would do, Rima.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.080]   I would take that five to six hours.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.920]   And before getting out of bed each morning,
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.280]   I would do a 10 to 30 minute NSDR,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.820]   non-sleep deep rest protocol,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.040]   which will allow you to feel deeply rested
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.520]   and frankly, to recover whatever bits of sleep
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.760]   that you perhaps missed during the night.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.940]   I found that to be a tremendously beneficial practice.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.880]   Waking up, if I don't feel thoroughly rested,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.960]   doing a 10 to 30 minute NSDR,
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.680]   then getting out of bed and continuing the day.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.920]   And if you don't have time to do that,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.400]   do that 10 minute, maybe 20 minute NSDR
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.440]   later in the day at any point.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.680]   And I think you'll see terrific results,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.100]   not just because you're recovering some sleep that you lost,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.560]   perhaps during the night,
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.080]   or maybe you just need five to six hours,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.420]   but also because you'll get better at falling
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.380]   and staying deeply asleep through the practice of NSDR
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.760]   in the morning or at some point throughout the day.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.640]   I wouldn't recommend anything else elaborate
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.480]   unless you're feeling really exhausted during the day,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.980]   in which case, then I would move
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.680]   to some of the more advanced sleep tools.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.200]   I've had vertigo, I should announce, this is a question.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.920]   I'm not just telling you about my vertigo.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.040]   I've had vertigo on and off and wonder what causes it.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.720]   Is it hormones, adrenals, autolysts moving around?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.540]   Ah, this person knows about the cochlea.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.980]   Hydration virus exposure.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.960]   Zenana, I think is how you pronounce your name.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.100]   Forgive me if that's not the correct pronunciation, Zenana.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.880]   So vertigo is very interesting.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.320]   Unfortunately, it's uncomfortable,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.880]   but we can learn a thing or two right now
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.440]   that should be able to help you, Zenana, and others,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.040]   even if they haven't had vertigo.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.920]   So vertigo, this perception of falling or dizziness,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.360]   needs to be distinguished from lightheadedness.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.780]   So if you're ever feeling dizzy,
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.760]   it's worth stopping and sitting, or if you can't sit,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.160]   standing and closing your eyes
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.840]   and asking yourself a question,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.920]   do I feel like I'm ready to fall straight down,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.500]   or do I feel like I'm going to spin and fall down?
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.080]   Because in answering that question,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.760]   you can determine whether or not you are lightheaded,
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.440]   that would be the straight falling down,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.200]   or you have vertigo, which is you're dizzy,
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.720]   which is that you're going to spin and fall down.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.940]   Now, do this in a safe place, please.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.780]   You can do this while bracing yourself against a wall,
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.420]   or that's why I said ideally seated,
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.260]   so you don't actually fall.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.260]   But in most cases, if you're feeling that spin,
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.660]   if you're feeling truly dizzy, you're feeling vertigo,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.120]   and I'm moving my head around on my own purpose,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.560]   then chances are you've got some issue
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.380]   in either your visual system or your inner ear.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.500]   Okay, so since this is being recorded on video,
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.800]   I can display what I'm about to say.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   So your visual system and your inner ear system for balance
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.000]   have some really important features.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.160]   I'm going to make this a very quick tutorial.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.200]   Your head, as you move through space,
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.160]   is experiencing visual images going by all the time.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.900]   Your retinas, your eyes, are essentially exposed
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.660]   to a lot of what's called visual slip.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.180]   Imagine you're walking and you're trying to take a picture
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.340]   on your iPhone, or if you have an Android phone
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.400]   on your Android phone, and you're moving,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.700]   it's going to be blurry, right?
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.140]   Well, there's a stabilization process
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.300]   in your body and brain.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.740]   It's a magnificent one that, frankly,
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.640]   is built into all jawed animals,
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.800]   whereby your head, because it can move forward,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.540]   so think nodding, right?
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.560]   So this is pitch for you, pilots, right?
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.060]   Yaw, moving from side to side, this would be the no.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.180]   This would be the no, no.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   So pitch, yaw, and roll,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.540]   which would be like the puppy look, right?
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.000]   Pitch, yaw, and roll.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.140]   Pitch, yaw, and roll.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:57.060]   Those are the three major angles of visual slip.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   And in an absolutely magnificent set of things,
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.760]   your inner ear has three hula hoop-like shaped structures,
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.980]   one that's arranged vertically, so up on its end,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.560]   one that's at an angle of about 45 degrees to that,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.620]   and another that sits like a hula hoop flat on the ground.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.640]   And inside of each of those little hula hoop-like tubes,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.860]   there are little stones called otoliths,
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.220]   okay, you heard that word earlier,
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.720]   that roll around on the bottom,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.140]   just like marbles at the bottom of a hula hoop,
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.640]   such that when you pitch, nod,
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.740]   the marbles in the vertical hula hoop slide back and forth.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.220]   When you say no,
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.500]   the marbles in that hula hoop lying essentially parallel
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.180]   to the floor move around.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.860]   And then the one at 45 degrees,
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.620]   when you roll your head from side to side, those move.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.740]   And each of those sends neural signals
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.660]   that converge on the neural signals coming from the eye,
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.360]   and get this, when you move through space,
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.980]   there is a precise offset of whatever visual slip
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.820]   you happen to be experiencing by walking,
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.200]   the images are moving, you're looking up,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.700]   you're looking at buildings, you're looking around,
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.780]   you're talking to somebody, they're moving their head,
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.820]   and your eye is making little tiny movements,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.880]   little microsaccades on the millisecond timescale
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.900]   that act as a perfect image stabilizer.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.540]   So what this means,
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.380]   this is by the way called the vestibulo-ocular reflex,
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.500]   vestibular system ocular reflex.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.460]   And it's mediated through a structure called the cerebellum
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.700]   in the back of the brain.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.540]   This is why when you're on a boat,
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.600]   when the horizon is tipping back and forth,
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.440]   I have to be careful with this
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.760]   because I have such a prominent seasickness
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.880]   based on a prior experience
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.300]   that if I think about this too much, I might get nauseous.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.820]   When that horizon is moving around,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.540]   your system becomes uncalibrated
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.020]   because you can't really keep the system jolting about
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.100]   in a regular way.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.660]   I have to be really careful here, I'm getting dizzy.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.500]   Notice I said dizzy, not lightheaded.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.260]   And you will end up disrupting that slip process
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.860]   and you'll essentially overcompensate,
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.080]   which is why whenever you feel sick on a boat,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.580]   they say, look at the horizon,
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.920]   fixate to something at a distance.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.300]   Okay, so if you have vertigo,
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.480]   almost certainly there's something going on
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.460]   in your inner ear.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.980]   Yes, it can be caused by viruses.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.560]   Yes, it can be caused by hormones.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.800]   These things tend to be transient,
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.700]   but the most important thing is going to be to anchor
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.720]   the visual part of the vestibular ocular reflex.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.220]   So what you're going to want to do
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.200]   is you're going to want to fixate on a point
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.180]   maybe three or four feet away.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.200]   And then you're going to actually want to move closer
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.060]   to that point, or if you don't have access to it,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.860]   you would want to look at your hand,
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.940]   your finger out in front of you,
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.820]   and then slowly move it in toward your nose.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.900]   At some point, you'll feel like you're going to go cross-eyed
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.540]   and you can stop at that point,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.260]   then move out again, then in again.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.780]   What are you doing when you're doing this?
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.260]   What you're doing is you're overriding the error signals,
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.460]   the incorrect error signals
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.780]   that exist in your kind of default setting
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.420]   at that when you have vertigo,
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.860]   and you're forcing the visual component to dominate,
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.020]   and then your inner ear mechanisms will adjust to that.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.560]   So this is a very powerful tool if you ever feel nauseous
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.860]   or seasick, it's a very powerful tool.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.860]   If you ever, and like me, you sit in the back of an Uber
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.300]   and the Uber is too small, you get out
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.500]   and you're like walk into a building
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.100]   where there are no windows.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.180]   I don't really feel good.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.100]   Get outside and look at a fixation point some distance away.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.140]   This actually happened the other day.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.260]   We went to the gym.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.260]   We went inside this gym.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.020]   We'd been in a van and then went inside
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.420]   and weren't feeling well.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.420]   So we decided to get out and just take a walk
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.300]   and fixate to the longest distance possible.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.140]   The fresh air probably helped as well.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.780]   But when doing that, you are anchoring the visual part
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.900]   of the vestibulocular reflex.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.700]   Now that's far and away better
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.700]   than trying to avoid moving your head
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.980]   to not get those little stones moving around
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.860]   in the semicircular canals.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.500]   Lots to say about this.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.660]   I could go on and on, but hopefully you learned some biology
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.660]   and you learned how to not be nauseous
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.180]   if ever you feel dizzy or nauseous based on movement,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.500]   motion sick.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   And we can talk about why you get motion sick,
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.500]   what is through the vagus nerve, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.020]   But this is a very useful tool.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.420]   And if you're ever just not feeling well,
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.260]   you know, unless you have a fever or something like that,
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.740]   I recommend getting outside
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.460]   and looking at the furthest fixation point
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.020]   with your vision that you possibly can
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.980]   and then walking toward it as far as you can safely.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.580]   If not, by actually just doing a few of these exercises
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.340]   of looking at your finger up close,
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.820]   that's going to be very good
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.580]   for anchoring the vestibular ocular reflex.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.020]   And not every time,
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.020]   but many times people report feeling better,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.300]   especially if you've moved from one closed environment
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.420]   to another closed environment,
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.060]   to another closed environment, and so on.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.060]   Okay, next question is,
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.780]   what can be done to improve brain function
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.900]   for people that have been negatively impacted by things
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.460]   such as poor sleep, poor diet, and TBI early in life?
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.300]   James.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.260]   Yeah, this is a great question and I get this a lot.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.420]   I think that it reminds me that a lot of the conversation
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.500]   that we have on the podcast is about the good things
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.780]   that happen when you do things right
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.260]   and the bad things that happen when you do things wrong.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.080]   And while I think that's an important conversation,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.260]   what I've frankly failed to do enough,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.800]   and that's why I'm grateful for this question,
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.860]   because it gives me the opportunity
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.500]   to talk more about the fact
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.900]   that your system is very robust.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.380]   There is neuroplasticity.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.340]   And also, as my graduate advisor used to say,
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.500]   time machine's broken,
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.700]   which is not to say you're out of luck,
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.500]   but I wouldn't spend any extra energy
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.300]   thinking about how many, not seeds, excuse me,
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.780]   how many, I have to be careful,
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.300]   the seed oil debate is still a debate, it's unclear,
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.900]   how many trans fats you were exposed to in childhood.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.260]   We know trans fats are bad.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.380]   Everyone agrees they're bad, governments agree they're bad.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.580]   This is perhaps one of the few things
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.460]   that everybody agrees on in the nutrition space.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.940]   Trans fats are bad.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.140]   When I was growing up, trans fats were abundant in foods.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.060]   There were probably fewer of certain things
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.500]   that we have more of now that are bad,
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.340]   but we ate a lot of trans fats.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.540]   We had margarine in our fridge.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.380]   There were other things that probably weren't good for us
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.420]   that we consumed.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.100]   And every once in a while, I'll think, gosh,
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.340]   if I had only been eating grass-fed meats
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.800]   and fruits and vegetables and healthy grains,
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.660]   as I do now, back then, imagine how much healthier I'd be,
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.620]   but I really don't spend too much time on it,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.020]   and I don't think you should either.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.240]   I think the most important thing to remember
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.580]   is that biological systems, unless they're really damaged,
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.580]   you're talking about a major injury, and even then,
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.520]   they're very robust.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.320]   You can overcome years, decades of poor use
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.720]   or misuse of those systems.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.620]   That said, if you have the opportunity
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.240]   to take care of them now, I highly suggest you do.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.160]   So for instance, if you haven't slept well for years,
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.340]   now's the time to get it right.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.280]   I wouldn't worry about the past, truly.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.320]   You can always rescue some of your health
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.440]   and healthspan and lifespan.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.360]   Poor diet, same thing.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.720]   It's a just do it kind of thing.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.020]   Just hop on the train of getting things right
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.820]   80 to 90% of the time.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.440]   TBI, traumatic brain injury.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.220]   Well, the episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.180]   is out right now with Dr. Mark Desposito.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.380]   He's an MD, a neurologist,
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.180]   originally trained at University of Pennsylvania,
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.700]   now at University of California, Berkeley.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.460]   We talk about TBI.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.060]   You know, there are a lot of different forms of TBI,
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.260]   different origins, you know,
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.280]   everything from bomb blasts to car accident
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.780]   to construction work to just, you know,
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.400]   slipped on the stairs at a party.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.540]   I know someone that slipped on some wet floor at a party
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.060]   and, you know, has a brain injury.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.180]   What do we know?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.660]   Well, you get back to the basics.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.380]   Sleep is going to be important,
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.420]   but there are some things
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.080]   like transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.400]   certainly things that reduce brain inflammation
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.640]   like glymphatic outflow.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.860]   So glymphatic outflow is this washing of the brain at night
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.260]   that removes debris.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.780]   Very, very important in the weeks and months
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.140]   after traumatic brain injury
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.400]   to get adequate sleep for that reason.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.240]   But then there are things
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.060]   that also seem to perhaps improve outcomes
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.100]   from traumatic brain injury,
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.380]   such as hyperbaric chamber,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.460]   so hyperoxygenation treatments,
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.500]   if you have access to those.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.100]   Even things like elevating the feet slightly
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.100]   when you sleep by about five to 15 degrees
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.300]   is known to increase glymphatic flow during sleep,
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.060]   which can, we believe,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.540]   by way of increased clearance
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.140]   of a bunch of basically debris,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.920]   reactive oxygen species within the cells,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.400]   but also debris outside the cells
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.500]   in the extracellular space.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.480]   So between neurons, there isn't just empty space.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.760]   There's all this like heavily glycosylated stuff,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.740]   which basically just means
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.540]   this kind of like spongy carbohydrate stuff
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.900]   that fills in the spaces.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.780]   The clearance of some of the metabolites
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.300]   and some of the debris that's accumulated there
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.580]   by just sleeping with feet slightly elevated,
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.520]   definitely not falling asleep in a chair upright.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.460]   That's the worst thing for glymphatic flow.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.540]   Things like that.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.380]   Some people will go kind of bonkers
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.140]   on all things anti-inflammation.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.700]   They start taking tons of curcumin,
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.660]   and they kind of get obsessed with inflammation
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.220]   as the enemy.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.160]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.480]   In fact, there's some negative effects
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.300]   of things like curcumin, turmeric.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.480]   If you take it in high doses,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.740]   like limiting the amount of dehydrotestosterone production,
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.500]   which is not good, you don't want that.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.940]   Male or female, you don't want to take too much turmeric
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.100]   or curcumin.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.020]   There are real issues with that.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.580]   To say nothing of the studies
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.780]   that have shown lead contamination in a lot of turmeric,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.760]   so you want to check the sourcing very carefully.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.420]   If you do consume any turmeric,
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.980]   a little bit is probably fine.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.420]   Cooking with it is fine.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.100]   But we're here, we're talking about supplementation,
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.060]   and just really not trying to turn inflammation
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.140]   into this terrible thing to the point
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.380]   where you're starting to do other things
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.780]   that are potentially damaging.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.080]   There's some really interesting evidence
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.740]   that five grams, maybe 10 grams,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.300]   depending on your body weight,
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.520]   of creatine monohydrate per day
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.980]   can enhance creatine phosphate metabolism in the forebrain
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.460]   and enhance brain function
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.100]   under conditions of high altitude or TBI.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.180]   I take five to 10 grams of creatine,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.420]   just creatine monohydrate powder.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.440]   And frankly, any creatine monohydrate powder
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.280]   should be sufficient.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.380]   There are other forms of creatine.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.700]   They are not any better.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.600]   Creatine monohydrate is the least expensive, fortunately.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.740]   That mixed in water, you take it with or without food.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.980]   Some people ask, "Does creatine make your hair fall out?"
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.860]   No, it does not make your hair fall out.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.500]   But some people do experience an increase in DHT
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.420]   with creatine monohydrate,
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.860]   and there can be a DHT hair loss link.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.020]   So if you think you're losing your hair from taking creatine,
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.000]   then stop and see, do the control experiment.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.840]   It should grow back.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.620]   But five to 10 grams of creatine monohydrate,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.340]   something to explore hyperbaric chambers,
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.640]   something to explore excellent sleep, definitely do that.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.880]   And I just wouldn't obsess over past ills or wrongs
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.340]   to the extent that it impacts your ability
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.100]   to try and correct those in the present.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.300]   I would say that about most everything.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.060]   But then again, I understand that as humans,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.380]   because we can remember the past, the present,
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.460]   and the future, that sometimes, you know,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.860]   it's difficult to let go of the mistakes of past
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.860]   that we made, but that's just simply being human,
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.880]   and I don't have a solution to that.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.260]   Are we any closer to finding the cause of OCD?
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.140]   Well, I think we know what causes OCD.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.220]   I think it's pretty clear that OCD is some form
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.740]   of miswiring in the basal ganglia,
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.900]   the structures of the brain that are involved in GO,
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.580]   action and NO-GO, withholding action type behaviors.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.540]   And some malwiring of those structures
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.900]   to the dopamine reward system,
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.660]   because here's what's interesting about OCD.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.220]   OCD involves obsessions, obviously, that's the O in OCD,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.740]   compulsions, the actions, that's the C in OCD,
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.280]   but in a kind of a weird twist of the neurology,
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.760]   OCD is a situation where the compulsion
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.900]   does not remove the obsession, rather it exacerbates it.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.180]   Okay, the compulsion does not remove the obsession,
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.100]   it exacerbates it.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.300]   So unlike an itch that you scratch,
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.760]   with OCD, the scratching of the itch makes it worse,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.040]   which is actually what we experience
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.180]   when we have a mosquito bite,
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.620]   which by the way, I have absolutely loathe mosquito bites.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.820]   It's one of my least favorite things in life.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.900]   I have about 3,600 and counting pet peeves,
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.960]   that's definitely high on the list of those.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.420]   The obsessive compulsive disorder
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.100]   is one that really needs to be treated,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.420]   frankly, neurologically.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.480]   It's one for which there are behavioral interventions,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.040]   but it's clear that adjusting the pharmacology
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.960]   of the neural circuits involved in OCD really can help.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.520]   Again, there are behavioral treatments,
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.200]   but for severe cases of OCD,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.800]   it's just very, very clear that interventions,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.080]   which include SSRIs, which have been demonized,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.920]   a lot of people say,
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.240]   "Oh, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are terrible,
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.080]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.440]   The serotonin hypothesis of depression isn't true."
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.100]   Well, listen, the reality is this,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.260]   that all treatments for depression that are effective,
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.380]   which include SSRIs in some cases,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.640]   cognitive behavioral treatments,
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.160]   all of these sorts of things which have shown efficacy,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.220]   are all about what?
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.040]   They're not about serotonin, they're about neuroplasticity.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.620]   That's why some antidepressants center
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.920]   on dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.740]   others center on serotonin, they're about neuroplasticity.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.900]   They're about changing neural networks.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.300]   They're not about a neurochemical per se,
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.300]   but the neuromodulators such as serotonin
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.720]   allow an access point, they are a wedge
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.820]   into the neuroplasticity process.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.680]   Now with OCD, in order to overcome these malwirings,
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.360]   it's very important to get plasticity.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.400]   How do you get plasticity?
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200]   Well, you, in my belief,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.900]   you work with an excellent psychiatrist
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.680]   who can prescribe the appropriate dose of drug
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.240]   to release the appropriate amount of neuromodulator.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.280]   Then, and this is really key,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.580]   you have opened up the window for plasticity,
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.360]   but then it's really important that the proper behaviors
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.200]   are engaged in.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.720]   And when I did an episode on OCD,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.120]   I talked about what some of these are.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.480]   For instance, the person is exposed to the stimulus
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.600]   that causes the obsession,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.440]   or maybe this obsession arises spontaneously.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.160]   They feel the impulse to complete the compulsion,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.200]   the behavior, and they resist
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.440]   with the support of a therapist,
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.080]   but they're doing this in the context
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.840]   of having elevated levels of serotonin
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.480]   or some other neuromodulator
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.060]   that then allows fewer trials of resistance,
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.180]   fewer times of needing to withhold the behavior
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.300]   that this person so badly wants to perform
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.460]   because it's coming from within,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.700]   it's this compulsion, literally,
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.860]   then they are able to achieve plasticity more quickly,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.420]   perhaps also transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.020]   So a conjunction of the correct behavior,
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.460]   the withholding behavior,
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.700]   maybe a replacement behavior that's often used,
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.780]   use a replacement behavior
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.480]   with the appropriate neurochemical milieu
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.000]   is the solution to OCD.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.760]   Okay, next question is,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.280]   if I'm just going to New York City from San Francisco,
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   how do I control shifting my circadian rhythm
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.000]   by only three hours?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.600]   So if you're going to New York City from San Francisco,
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.040]   the best way, frankly,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.440]   would be to get up an hour earlier,
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.160]   two days before you head off to New York,
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.120]   and then another day you might try and shift by two hours
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.080]   before you go and then head to New York
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.980]   and do the last shift on the last day.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.140]   Most people won't do that.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.860]   It's just, you know, it takes a little bit of work,
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.060]   but they just don't have the time ability
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.260]   or your discipline to do that,
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.300]   but it is perhaps the best way.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.220]   I would say the best thing to do
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.200]   is to know your temperature minimum,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960]   and I'll try and keep this pretty simple.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.120]   If you typically wake up at 8 a.m.,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.740]   let's say, just by way of example,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.820]   that means that your minimum body temperature is at 6 a.m.,
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.720]   which means that if you want to get up earlier
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.840]   in the days where you travel to New York,
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.140]   well, in the couple of days before you leave,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.720]   anytime between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m.,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.960]   get some bright light in your eyes,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.180]   even if you go back to sleep.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.940]   So for instance, get up at 6 a.m., set an alarm clock.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.540]   I know you normally like to get up at 8 a.m.,
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.900]   get up at 6 a.m., get some bright light in your eyes
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.380]   from artificial sources or from sunlight,
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.420]   maybe 5, 10 minutes, then go back to sleep until 8 a.m.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.540]   You do that again the next night,
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.540]   and then you head off to New York,
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.320]   you'll find the shift to be much easier.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.660]   Now, here's what you don't want to do.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.380]   You want to make sure that you do not
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.300]   view bright light before 6 a.m.,
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.440]   so in the middle of the night, if you get up,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.300]   you need to use the restroom, try and use dim lights,
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.860]   as dim as is safely possible, et cetera.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.120]   And what are you doing when you're doing this?
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.420]   I could get into a long description
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.400]   of the science behind this,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.860]   and I'll probably do a podcast all about this at some point,
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.460]   but really what you're doing if you get up at 6 a.m.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.340]   and getting some bright light exposure is,
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.180]   you think about it,
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.060]   you're kind of looking at a New York sunrise of sorts, okay?
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.860]   If it's not a sunrise, you're getting some bright light
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.800]   that mimics sunrise, at least to some extent.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.460]   Nothing's quite like sunrise, but to some extent.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.540]   So in that sense, even if you go back to sleep,
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.560]   what you're doing is you're sending the light signal,
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.140]   the zeitgeber, the time signal,
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.400]   to your circadian clock of your hypothalamus
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.900]   that it should shift, that you'd need to get up earlier,
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.860]   and indeed, that will happen
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.820]   over the course of about two, three days.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.700]   The other thing you can do,
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.460]   and I know this is kind of rare these days
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.340]   to get an answer like this,
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.140]   the other thing you can do is just fly to New York
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.660]   and force yourself to get up and just drink caffeine
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.260]   and get out and exercise and use the social rhythm
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.140]   of the activity of the city in order to get up earlier,
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.220]   but you will feel lousy late morning.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.380]   And so you would only want to do that
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.660]   if you could access a brief nap
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.740]   of anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes late morning,
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.140]   and then you'll feel fine.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.760]   But my suggestion would be to,
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.740]   something back there, like some animal or something,
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.540]   likes that answer so much, so like that, yeah,
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.960]   would be to just try and get a little bit of light exposure
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.860]   a couple hours before your normal wake-up time,
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.700]   then go back to sleep in the two days
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.540]   before you head off to New York City.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.420]   And of course, everything here was set
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.880]   in the context of the New York City,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.660]   it's a flight from San Francisco to New York City,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.620]   but the principle, the logic holds.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.580]   And if you have any questions
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.780]   about this temperature minimum and wake-up time
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.920]   and you want to get your circadian clock right for travel,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.140]   check out the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work,
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.540]   and I'm realizing now as I say this,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.080]   and my team's here and they're listening,
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.700]   that I will do a video on the Human Lab Clips channel
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.660]   where I explain temperature minimum
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.740]   and how to plug in your normal wake-up time
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.260]   in order to essentially arrive
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.740]   at whatever time shift you want.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.420]   We should probably put that out as a newsletter too,
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.660]   where it's a little chart where it says,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.420]   I currently wake up at 8 a.m.,
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.020]   and then, which means my,
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.260]   and then it'll say subtract two hours,
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.220]   my temperature minimum is 6 a.m.,
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.920]   and I want to travel to whatever it is,
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.800]   I don't know, Sydney, Australia on this date from this city,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.480]   and then we know the time change,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.880]   and then I can tell you exactly what to do
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.720]   for a couple of days.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.260]   I've done this for various military groups.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.720]   I've done this for people and close friends
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.800]   and who travel a lot, and it works fabulously well.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.440]   I can't eliminate jet lag for you.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.200]   Don't I wish I could just eliminate jet lag?
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.260]   I can't do that, but I definitely can have the time
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.360]   that it takes for you to shift maybe more.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.540]   Hi, hi.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.560]   I love "The Sydney Show."
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.160]   Thank you, thanks for coming out.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.380]   Thanks for coming to Australia.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.860]   Thanks for having us.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.340]   I take fish oil, but I'm not sure
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.500]   I'm getting the dose right.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.240]   What are your thoughts on fish oil and dose?
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.600]   I have lots of thoughts on fish oil.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.860]   I think it's a terrific tool.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.700]   I think every time I see a study
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.520]   or a news article saying fish oil not shown to,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.960]   I just go, oh gosh, all right, well, listen,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.080]   whoever's reading, wrote that article,
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.800]   you know, I take no pleasure
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.240]   in your declining health span or lifespan whatsoever,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.500]   but the rest of us are going to be taking fish oil.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.340]   And here's why.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.120]   There's just, oh, so much evidence
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.040]   that getting enough omega-3 fatty acids
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.760]   is great for brain health, body health.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.080]   And I think that the issue around fish oil
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.880]   is typically around contaminants.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.720]   So you want to make sure
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.080]   that it doesn't have loads of mercury.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.200]   So things like sardines, cod liver oil, et cetera,
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.080]   you can get those from natural sources,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.840]   except there's one problem.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.000]   I hate sardines, and I don't want to slurp down
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.400]   a bunch of cod fat.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.800]   I'm just not interested in that.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.680]   So if you eat a lot of fatty ocean fish
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.480]   and it's really clean fish, great.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.960]   I don't, most people don't.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.680]   So I believe in taking a high quality fish oil.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.040]   There are a lot of different sources of these.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.760]   In fact, in the episode that we did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.040]   there's a link in the show note captions, I believe,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.600]   that takes you to a chart of the different fish oil sources
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.000]   and their relative levels of contaminants, et cetera.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.360]   But most of the reputable brands out there
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.800]   are not going to have any contaminants
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.260]   because they've been cleaned out.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.160]   It's been checked for.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.060]   So I take the fish oil from AG1 or from Momentus.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.900]   That's just me.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.440]   There are a lot of other great sources out there,
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.280]   but I will say this.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.000]   That's when I'm traveling and I take capsules.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.800]   Typically, I like to take it in liquid form,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.840]   and I will take it in liquid form.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.360]   I have no financial relationship
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.120]   to the liquid non-capsule forms of fish oil,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   and I get the one that has a lemon flavor
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.280]   to overcome the absolutely disgusting flavor
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.560]   of cod liver oil.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.240]   I guess, I don't know, presumably cod,
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.040]   like the taste of cod liver oil, but I don't.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.920]   So that's what I do.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.000]   I'll take a tablespoon of that once a day
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.820]   and a protein shake.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.660]   It tastes like lemon.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.320]   It doesn't taste like cod, thank goodness.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.120]   And when I travel, I take the capsules from AG1 or Momentus,
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.960]   or there are excellent ones from other sources.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.580]   I mean, lots of great sources out there.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.680]   Now, what are we trying to do when we take fish oil?
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.700]   Yes, it can reduce inflammation.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.200]   Yes, it can do a number of different things,
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.700]   but that's all by way of omega-3 fatty acid intake, right?
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.320]   Most people get far too much omega-6, right?
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.860]   This is why there's a seed oil debate.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.700]   We're not going to have that debate now.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.700]   We put us all to sleep, frankly.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.120]   The key thing is to get enough omega-3s,
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.360]   and they're hard to get unless you're eating krill.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.400]   So unless you're a large, you know, baleen whale,
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.480]   you're probably not eating that much krill.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.180]   If you're getting fatty fish, great.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.240]   But when you take an omega-3 fatty acid
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.180]   in the form of fish oil,
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.100]   or you eat sardines for that matter,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.380]   what you're getting essentially is the substrate
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.400]   for a lot of other important building blocks,
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.760]   not the least of which is the lipid bilayer
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.840]   that surrounds the neurons of your brain.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.240]   And so basically the omega-3 fatty acids
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.920]   provide the substrate for some key building blocks
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.960]   of nerve cells and other cells in the brain and body.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.120]   And, and this is perhaps the most important reason
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.960]   I can think of,
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.640]   when you get out past one gram of the EPA form of omega-3,
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.420]   okay, one gram of EPA form of omega-3 per day,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.340]   it's clear there's a either mild
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.180]   to moderate antidepressant effect,
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.620]   so much so that one can, in some cases,
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.200]   talk to your psychiatrist or psychologist,
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.520]   partially offset the dosage of any antidepressant.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.780]   I am not telling you to go off antidepressant medication
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.740]   and go on to fish oil.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.700]   That is not what I'm saying.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.100]   I'm just saying that there's some impressive clinical trials
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.520]   showing that fish oil, if taken at dosages
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.780]   of one to three grams of EPA per day,
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.620]   can have a mild to moderate antidepressant effect.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.460]   And I don't know anyone
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.820]   that wouldn't want to have better mood.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.540]   So I take one and a half grams of EPA,
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.620]   which is not to say one and a half grams of fish oil.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.260]   You need to look at the package and see how much fish oil,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.740]   but then look at how much EPA.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.720]   And typically it's less than one gram per serving,
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.700]   so you may have to take two servings.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.760]   Some people say, well, is it safe to take two servings?
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.160]   I don't see any reason why not.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.640]   And then of course there are the high potency fish oils
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.160]   for which there is certainly one gram or more of EPA.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.140]   Keep in mind that all this discussion about fish oil
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.740]   might sound kind of health food, hippie store,
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.080]   forgive me hippies, health food store kind of stuff.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.020]   But the reality is that EPA, high concentration EPA,
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.900]   is actually a prescription drug
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.980]   in the United States and elsewhere,
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.220]   prescribed often for enhancing mental health,
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.940]   enhancing cardiovascular health and on and on.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.900]   So we're not out on a limb or out on a fin as it were.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.220]   When we're having this discussion,
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.600]   we're actually just talking about something
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.300]   for which there's a lot of clinical evidence,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.640]   there's a lot of biochemical evidence,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.600]   there's a lot of mechanisms.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.540]   So I take anywhere from one to two grams of EPA per day,
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.500]   even if that requires taking six
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.940]   rather than the suggested three capsules per day
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.180]   or taking a full tablespoon
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.520]   or even two tablespoons of fish oil.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.040]   And frankly, most people are getting too much omega-6,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.300]   fatty acids, and not enough omega-3.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.460]   So shout out to the fish oils.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.000]   What is the recommended protocol
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.300]   for measuring hormone levels?
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.140]   Interesting.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.940]   How frequently do you advise monitoring these levels
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.420]   to accurately determine their typical range?
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.180]   And I just have to try and pronounce your name,
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.260]   Volod Reznichenko.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.180]   What a cool name, Volod Reznichenko.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.260]   I'm a big fan of like two syllable first and then today.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.420]   All right.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.960]   So Volod Reznichenko, thank you for this question
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.900]   and the opportunity to try and pronounce your name.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.900]   So hormone levels.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.180]   I think a good thing to do
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.520]   is in the absence of any apparent
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.360]   or suspected endocrine dysfunction, right?
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.180]   So we're talking about you feel pretty good,
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.260]   you're wondering if you're good under,
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.460]   if I say good under the hood,
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.500]   that just sounds like weird, it rhymes.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.700]   So if you're feeling pretty good,
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.580]   I recommend getting your hormone levels checked once,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.620]   if you can, if you're still in your teens,
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.340]   in your late teens, after you've gone through puberty,
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.940]   to establish a sort of baseline.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.540]   Most people won't do that because it's too late,
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.520]   I didn't do that.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.380]   Once in your mid 20s,
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.420]   again, we're talking about no suspected
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.620]   or apparent endocrine dysfunction, okay?
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.000]   In your mid 20s, so you have a baseline,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.800]   something to compare to when you were in your,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.580]   say 18 to 20 and again, and when you're 25,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.940]   that would be ideal.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.160]   And then again, I would say when you're 30
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.920]   and then start once a year,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.220]   starting when you are 40 or older.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.260]   I think that just, you know, just logically,
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.900]   I would love to know what my hormone levels were
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.420]   when I was 25, when I was 30,
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:57.620]   maybe when I was, yeah, when I was 18, 25, 30, 35,
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   and actually 35 is when I got my first blood draw
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.980]   for just getting a look under the hood.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.820]   Like what's there?
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.520]   What are my estrogen levels, what are my testosterone levels,
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.200]   what are my growth hormone levels, this kind of thing.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.080]   And then once you're 40 and older,
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.680]   I think once a year minimum,
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.080]   and I realized that some people out there are going to say,
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.280]   well, that's ridiculous.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.560]   What are you going to do with that information?
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.080]   Well, you're going to do a lot with that information.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.060]   You're going to figure out whether or not
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.480]   your LDL cholesterol is in healthy range.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   You're going to figure out whether or not
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.520]   your ALT is in healthy range.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.360]   You're going to figure out whether or not
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.920]   your ApoB is in healthy range.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.800]   You're going to figure out a lot more
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.020]   than just whether or not your testosterone is 400, 600,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.580]   800 or 1200.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.220]   And I think we also need to be careful
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.780]   about over-interpreting results of hormones
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.820]   because a lot of it has to do
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.460]   with the ratio of testosterone to estrogen
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.060]   or the ratio of free testosterone to testosterone,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.580]   both in men and women.
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.580]   So for instance, if your testosterone level is 900,
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.140]   but your free testosterone level is two,
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.500]   well, then you have a problem.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.500]   Whereas if your total testosterone level is 500 or 600,
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.260]   but your free testosterone level is 15,
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.240]   well, then you're probably doing pretty well.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.220]   So I would say getting your hormone levels checked
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.480]   once a year after age 40,
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.320]   and prior to that, once every three to five years,
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.040]   starting at about age 18 would be ideal.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.120]   But most people don't do that.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.680]   They either don't have the disposable income.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.200]   I certainly didn't when I was 18, 20, 25.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.680]   And at that time, it was really hard to get that measured
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.780]   unless you had a clinical problem.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.880]   Now, if anyone has a clinical problem
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.340]   that they suspect or is real, then obviously more testing.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.960]   I think great sources for endocrine profiling
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.000]   are things like InsideTracker, full disclosure,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.780]   they are a sponsor of the podcast,
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.820]   but they do an excellent job.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.060]   They'll even come to your house.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.920]   The phlembotomist will come to your house if you want,
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.840]   or you can go to a clinic.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.580]   So they make it all very easy.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.720]   But there are other sources as well, right?
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.480]   I'll never make these AMAs or anything else
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.360]   about specific companies for its own sake.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.600]   I just think InsideTracker does a great job.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.560]   There are a number of clinics like Meric Health
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.380]   and others online clinics that will do that,
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.520]   but it's part of a more comprehensive package
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.080]   of agreeing to work with them.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.480]   At least that's how I understand it.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.600]   I hope I didn't get that wrong, but check and see.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.720]   Nowadays, it's pretty easy to find ways
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.200]   to get your hormones checked,
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.920]   but I would suggest that the following things
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.000]   at least beyond there.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.040]   Growth hormone, or IGF-1, rather, IGF-1, testosterone,
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.880]   estrogen, this is true for women and men, by the way.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.060]   So IGF-1, testosterone, estrogen,
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.040]   they'll show up as estradiol on there.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.640]   Free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, cortisol.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   Keep in mind, morning cortisol is always elevated
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.240]   relative to afternoon cortisol.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.960]   It will be impacted by food.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.240]   So you want to go in fasted in the morning,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.100]   ideally get this done early.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.520]   Your creatinine levels, which by the way, will be elevated
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.880]   if you're taking creatine or you're exercising hard,
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.800]   your doctor will say, "Your creatinine levels are elevated."
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.620]   And you say, "Well, great.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.400]   Well, my creatine intake is elevated too."
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.440]   So, you know, take that.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.400]   It's not going to be a problem necessarily
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.080]   to check with your doctor.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:09.320]   LDL cholesterol, ApoB, and there are probably a few others
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.400]   that would be good to have in there for men and women,
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.320]   sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG,
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.320]   and for women, especially progesterone and prolactin,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.620]   and any of the progestins are going to be important.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.100]   And of course, for women, the trick is going to be
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.920]   when you get your blood taken with respect
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.760]   to your hormone cycle, your ovulatory cycle,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.460]   and to try and make that at least consistent
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.200]   from test to test, not necessarily having to go in
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.120]   both during the follicular and the luteal phase
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.640]   of your cycle, but always going in during, you know,
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.060]   mid follicular or mid luteal.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.320]   And that can be challenging to do perhaps,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.820]   but that's going to be important because of course,
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.520]   those are widely fluctuating levels across the cycle.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.360]   But unless you're really obsessed with your hormone levels
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.680]   and analyzing them, taking them at multiple times
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.320]   throughout your menstrual cycle,
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.660]   probably not necessary unless you're starting to think
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.660]   about conceiving or there's some issue, PCOS or other issue.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:12.320]   Okay, I find that I need to do NSDR after working out.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.440]   Any thoughts on this?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.920]   Yes, well, first of all, I'm glad you're using NSDR,
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.280]   a zero cost tool known to replenish mental
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.760]   and physical vigor, works oh so well.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.600]   I think it's great.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.440]   I think it probably is accelerating your recovery.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.640]   I think this tells me that you're probably working out
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.520]   really hard and hopefully not too long.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.440]   If you find that you work out in the morning
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.560]   and then you're really, really sleepy in the afternoon
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.400]   and the next day, you might be working out too long
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.120]   or too hard.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.200]   So maybe ratchet back the intensity a little bit
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.100]   or the duration.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.020]   It's amazing how great we can feel when we work out
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.020]   to like 80 to 90% of our maximum output and duration.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.320]   We did this the other day.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.320]   We went out for a little jog, run, bounding, skipping,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   jumping jack thing and stopped at like 80 to 90% of maximum
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.940]   and then went about the rest of the day
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.560]   and evening feeling great.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.000]   If you do this consistently,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.320]   you'll find you have more energy
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.240]   and there's actually a lot of solid physiology
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.920]   and physics to support why that is,
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.380]   as opposed to if you go to the gym
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.200]   and you do every set to failure or even every exercise,
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.500]   you include one set to failure
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.120]   and you're grinding out four straps
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.980]   or I don't know what kind of exercise you're doing
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.680]   or you're running more and more distance each day
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.940]   or with more intensity.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.720]   It's understandable how one gets kind of drawn to
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.600]   or addicted to that burn or the effort,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.000]   but keep in mind that is stress.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.200]   You're stressing the body to produce
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.360]   a certain kind of adaptation,
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.840]   either endurance or strength or hypertrophy
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.040]   or et cetera, adaptation.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   So there's real beauty in learning to love working out hard,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.720]   but to leaving the gym or ending the run
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.120]   with 10 to 20% of the gas in the tank
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.200]   and knowing that you can come back and do more
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.840]   and you actually kind of want to do more.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.920]   There's, it increases vigor
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.600]   as opposed to taking yourself over that cliff
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.300]   even a slight 10 to 20%
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.680]   and then finding that you're kind of depleted.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.620]   And this is something that we don't hear enough about
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.820]   because we, most people that are into fitness
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.020]   are into pushing themselves.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:14.960]   It's also true for work.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.880]   I think some of the best advice I ever got
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.100]   in the professional landscape
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.920]   was when I was a graduate student
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.040]   at UC Berkeley and an excellent neurologist
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.420]   by the name of Bob Knight said,
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.640]   "The key is to figure out
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.660]   "how much can you work each day consistently?
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.760]   "If that's four hours a day, fine.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.400]   "If that's eight hours a day, fine."
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.820]   We're talking with weekend breaks
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.820]   'cause that was in the era of weekend breaks.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.260]   Maybe a weekend every once in a while
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.460]   where you have a deadline.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.260]   But by thinking about what you personally
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.620]   can really do consistently while maintaining sleep
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.140]   and mental health and physical health,
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.920]   you're going to go a lot further
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.540]   than doing like, for instance, what I did,
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.760]   which is, you know, maniac
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.600]   and working hundred hour weeks as a graduate student.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.660]   And then ending up sick four times a year
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.140]   and missing out on a bunch of days
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.220]   when I could have been in labs.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.300]   So these days I try and get as much focused work
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.140]   done as possible,
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.260]   but trying to make that as consistent as possible,
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.220]   if not from every day to the next over time.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.660]   You know, figure out what those averages are
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.540]   and don't be ashamed of those averages.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.360]   I would say declare those averages to people
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.740]   so they know what to expect.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.220]   And the fact that you can do more
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.020]   does not necessarily mean that you should do more
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:18.140]   because I think one of the best pieces of advice
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.040]   I ever got in the world of fitness
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.340]   is more important than training hard,
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.560]   more important than doing any particular exercises,
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.380]   more important than anything is to not get hurt.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.200]   Because if you get hurt, you can't train.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.120]   So I love that you're doing NSDR after training.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.840]   I love that you're making that part of your practice,
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.920]   but maybe also throttle back a little bit
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.860]   'cause you said I have to do it after training.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.940]   Maybe throttle back a little bit
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.660]   on the duration or intensity of exercise
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.220]   and see how you feel.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.780]   What can we do to optimize the function
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.700]   of our gut brain axis?
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.820]   That's very simple.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.180]   Get enough sleep in addition to that.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.860]   Avoid excessive intake of antibiotics,
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.180]   but if your doctor prescribes them, take them.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.320]   IMAB, lever, and antibiotics, okay?
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.980]   Before the internet jumps on me, I'm not anti-antibiotic.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.480]   I always want to say that.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.140]   I'm not anti-antibiotic.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.700]   I am not pro-antibiotic, but I am pro-probiotics.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.700]   I'm probiotic.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.980]   So I think you should ingest one to four servings
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.480]   of low-sugar fermented foods per day.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.780]   So sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, or kefir, or otherwise,
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.940]   whatever you like and fits
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.600]   with your nutrition preferences and plan.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.860]   I think it's also very important
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.820]   that you don't overuse antiseptics,
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.260]   like antiseptic mouthwashes and hand rinses
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.100]   and all that stuff.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.180]   This was all discussed on a podcast episode I did
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.540]   with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.580]   which is just to say that Justin,
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.660]   who's a professor at Stanford and is amazing,
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.860]   even said that he lets his kids eat lunch
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.060]   when they've been playing outside
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.400]   without washing their hands before eating lunch
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.580]   because he wants the probiotic makeup of their gut
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.160]   to be diverse, including from outside.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.820]   Now, I'm presuming that's not a public park.
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.960]   I'm assuming it's their yard.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.820]   So we're not talking about gross stuff being on their hands.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.540]   We're talking about a little dirt here and there.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.780]   Turns out owning a pet increases the diversity
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.880]   of your microbiome.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.580]   Lots of things like that.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.100]   I mean, you don't want to go around, you know,
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.620]   licking people's pets.
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.580]   It's okay to let them lick you
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:16.220]   depending on what your preferences are, but don't lick them.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.860]   But when you interact with people,
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.240]   you shake their hands or pets,
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.220]   you're increasing the diversity of your microbiome.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.340]   When you eat low sugar fermented foods,
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.760]   you want to make sure also you get enough fiber,
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.800]   both prebiotic and probiotic fiber,
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.700]   so fruits and vegetables.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.800]   The fiber debate for me just like makes me roll my eyes.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.360]   I mean, it's so clear that fiber is good for us,
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.820]   for gut motility and for offsetting cancers of the gut.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.360]   I mean, I realize there are the people out there
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.100]   who are really into elimination diets
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.460]   where they just only eat meat,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:49.460]   but I mean, there's just so much good data on fiber,
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.100]   especially from fibrous vegetables.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.820]   It just seems like, yes.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.200]   I mean, it's almost silly that we have the debate frankly,
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.380]   but I'm sure someone out there who's pure carnivore
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.780]   will be shouting, but guess what?
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.720]   You're shouting and you're constipated.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.640]   Last question.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:11.060]   Regarding the subject on tongue cleaning
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.300]   from the oral health episode,
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.180]   can you please share a bit on brushing tongue,
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.540]   scraping tongue and generally how best to clean the tongue?
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:23.720]   So tongue cleaning came up on the oral health episode.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.800]   I talked to four different dentists and a periodontist
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.220]   in preparation for that episode.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.300]   Almost all of them remarkably extraordinarily converged
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.660]   on the same advice, except for some slight deviations
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.500]   around frequency of flossing.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.440]   It's kind of cool, right?
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.420]   A field where almost everybody seems to agree.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.180]   I realize that isn't the usual sample size,
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.180]   but I picked them from diverse locations,
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.880]   backgrounds, trainings, et cetera.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.540]   Every one of them said brush and floss your teeth.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.860]   Every one of them said antiseptic alcohol-based
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.220]   mouthwashes are bad.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.100]   And every single one of them said that brushing your teeth
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.740]   before sleep is especially important because at night
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.420]   you produce less saliva and you want to be able
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.500]   to remineralize your teeth, that is fill in cavities
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.240]   that are starting to form while you sleep.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.180]   So brush your teeth floss ideally as well before sleep,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.020]   but at least brush.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.080]   And of course in the morning too, for everyone's sake.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.080]   But if we're talking about tongue brushing and scraping,
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.640]   it was clear that the tongue scraping was advised
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.000]   if done correctly, okay?
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.340]   Because there are certain bacteria that grow on the tongue
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.800]   that you don't want there and that scraping can help
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.720]   with the turnover of healthy bacteria there
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.540]   in addition to removing some of the bad bacteria,
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.040]   but that most people scrape their tongue too hard.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.680]   And rather it would be wise to brush your tongue gently
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.940]   with a soft toothbrush.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:44.700]   And by the way, you should also use a soft brush
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.540]   for your teeth, but not the same one that you use
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.380]   for tongue brushing.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.320]   So the takeaway that I was told and it makes a lot of sense
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.260]   to me based on what I know now about the biology,
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:57.860]   physiology and care of the mouth is that you want to use
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.960]   a different soft toothbrush to brush your tongue
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.860]   than the soft brush that you use to brush your teeth.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.080]   And that you do not need to use anything on it,
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.400]   but if you wanted to put a little bit of salt
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.820]   and baking soda, that is perfectly fine.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.400]   A lot of people wonder whether or not baking soda
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.900]   scrapes the enamel off the teeth.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.960]   It actually is low on the abrasion scale dentists have,
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.500]   believe it or not, an abrasion scale with a list of things
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.360]   of how much enamel it scrapes off at a given pressure.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.080]   These dentists have done their work.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.320]   It's really, really cool.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.640]   I can't say I always liked dentists.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.840]   I didn't like going to the dentist.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.860]   They always seem like nice people,
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.080]   but now I have newfound respect for dentists.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.300]   They really care about their craft and oral health
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.220]   has been kind of pushed to the backseat
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.280]   of the different aspects of health.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.080]   I consider it one of the major pillars of mental health
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.960]   and physical health, because taking care of your teeth,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.640]   your gums, your mouth, including your oral microbiome
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.280]   is critical for cardiovascular health.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.240]   It's critical for brain health.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.920]   One of the bad bacteria is streptococcus mutans
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.440]   that can proliferate in the mouth,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.300]   especially after eating sugary foods,
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.800]   can make it through the blood-brain barrier.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.040]   And maybe it's thought one of the causes of dementia
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.680]   can disrupt your neurons.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.840]   Your brain and body is a system.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.700]   Everything's talking to everything else.
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.220]   And so, yeah, brush your tongue,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.160]   but use a separate soft brush to do that
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.540]   and replace it every few weeks to months.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.080]   That can, I suppose, get expensive,
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.380]   but probably not as expensive
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:21.720]   as some of the other health issues that were just described.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.680]   So I appreciate that question.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.000]   We didn't talk about oil pulling on the podcast.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:26.980]   A lot of people asked about that.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.280]   Some people like to swish oil and then spit it out.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.900]   That's the way that's oil pulling for oral health.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.440]   All the dentists I spoke to said,
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.260]   nah, not big fans of oil pulling, but none of them said
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.940]   it would be particularly bad.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.360]   But, you know, so if you enjoy it
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.920]   or you think it works for you, great.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.980]   But none of them really pointed to any clear evidence
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.300]   that it was going to be beneficial.
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.920]   So I was told that was the last question,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.580]   and we are coming up on the hour.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.060]   Again, I want to thank everybody for joining this AMA.
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.580]   I'm doing this from Australia, Sydney, Australia.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.340]   What's interesting down here is,
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.280]   because we are below the equator,
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.080]   everything is reversed, right?
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.920]   So this was actually, it's being presented to you upside.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.060]   I'm actually upside down, but they turned the camera,
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.660]   so I would appear right side up to you.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.960]   I also, when I'm down here, I drink my AG1.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.240]   Normally I swish it counterclockwise,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.680]   but I notice here reflexively I'm swishing it clockwise.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.760]   So anyway, lots of interesting stuff going on.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.120]   We'll talk about how that all works.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.520]   It's not through the vestibular ocular reflex, it turns out,
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.920]   but maybe on a future episode of the podcast
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.900]   about the relationship between location
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.360]   relative to the equator and neural functioning,
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.800]   and I'm just kidding.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.960]   But what I'm not kidding about
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   is they appreciate that you tuned in.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.440]   And last, but certainly not least,
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.240]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.820]   [upbeat music]
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.080]   (upbeat music)
