[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, cemeteries are unique places.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   They're somber, normally very quiet acres,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   quarantined from the bustle of a city.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   For many, these are awkwardly uncomfortable places.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   But others are drawn to make regular pilgrimages to cemeteries.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And for those who do visit cemeteries,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   it raises the question over what we're seeking to accomplish
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   in a grave visit.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   The question is from Dave.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for this podcast," he writes.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   "I appreciate your thoughtful answers to hard questions.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I'm wondering what Christians should do and feel and think at a cemetery.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I see some Christians decorating their loved ones' graves with flowers.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Some visit often, even weekly.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Some remember fondly.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Some weep every time they visit over a period of many years.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Is there bad theology behind some of these practices?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   At what point do we become overly maudlin?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   When does it become ancestor worship?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   When does it become a wasting of time?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The Bible observes extended periods of mourning and death.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Also, some graves were clearly marked and remembered for generations.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And Solomon said that it's better to go to the house of mourning
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   than to go to the house of feasting.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   What should Christians accomplish and take away from cemetery visits?"
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   There are moments in life that signify in an unusual way
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   a division between the past and the future.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Graduation from high school or college, marriage, a new job.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   That season is over.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   A new season is beginning.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But it seems to me that apart from our own conversion,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   probably the event that divides our past and future most decisively
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   is the death of someone we love.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   That season is over in a way that is more absolute
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   than all the other season endings.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And you might say a cemetery or a memorial stone or a brass marker
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   with a precious name on it is like a large, unavoidable signpost
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   pointing in two directions--your past life with your loved one
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and your future life without your loved one.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So what is a biblical disposition or a biblical attitude
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   as you stand there beside that glaring signpost dividing your life?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Or the way Dave asked the question, "Are there unbiblical, unhealthy things
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   that you could do at this signpost, this gravestone?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And are there biblical and healthy things that you could do in a cemetery?"
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So let me start with mentioning a few unbiblical, unhealthy things
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   you could feel and do in the cemetery and then end
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   with some biblical, healthy suggestions.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   What would make our visit to the graveside of a loved one unbiblical
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and unhealthy would be a kind of ongoing need for the deceased person
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   that is not being met by faith in Jesus and is being expressed
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   in unhealthy and Christ-dishonoring ways.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Now, the Bible does clearly say that there is a sense in which
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   members of the body of Christ--and that would include Christian family members--
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   need each other. That's no dishonor to Christ when we realize
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that other people are gifts from Christ and are intended to represent Christ to us.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So in 1 Corinthians 12:21, Paul says, "The eye cannot say to the hand,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   'I have no need of you.'" Yes, you do. It's not right for you to say
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   you don't need other people that God has designed and put in your life.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   But when God, in his providence, which is always wise and just and good
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and toward his people always loving, takes away a member of the body of Christ,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   a member of the family, he is saying, God is saying,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   "You don't need this person anymore. Not the way you did before.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I will be your supply. I will meet every need of yours in Christ Jesus."
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So if our visit to the cemetery is an ongoing expression of,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "I need you. I can't live without you," that's an expression of distrust
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   in the promises of Christ. Some examples of what that distrust might look like
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   would be, for example, coming to the cemetery to express anger at God,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   feeling angry at the all-wise, all-good God is a sinful response to loss.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Or you might come to the cemetery to say, "I need you so urgently
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   that I'm going to try to communicate with the dead."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Now God said to Israel in Deuteronomy 18.10, "There shall not be found among you
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   anyone who is a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   For whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's a sin to try to set up a communication with the dead.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Or another form that this unfaithful response might take would be
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   coming to the cemetery to do penance for all the ways you can remember
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   that you failed the person who has died. You feel guilty, and you think that
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   perhaps if you show enough sorrow at the graveside, it will make up for the wrongs
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   that you did. And the problem with that is that Christ does not teach us
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   to deal with our failures and our sins that way. He understands our failures
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and our guilt feelings. And believe me, every one of us at the graveside
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   of someone we loved are going to feel this. We're going to feel a sense of failure.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   We're going to remember all the ways we could have loved so much better.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Yes, we will. But the solution to that painful problem of guilt is not more
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   hours of penance in the cemetery in the rain, but more trust in the all-sufficiency
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   of the blood of Christ. So those are a few of the ways that coming to the cemetery
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   might be unbiblical and unhealthy. What about healthy, healthy ways?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I'll just mention seven bullet points. Number one, come to the cemetery to weep.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   There is no question but that losing someone you love is worse than an amputation,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and amputations hurt and bidden or unbidden, the tears flow. It is right that they do so,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and the graveside is a most fitting place for those tears. Number two, come to the cemetery
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   to be sobered by your own mortality, your own inevitable death. As the psalmist says,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   we should get a heart of wisdom by numbering our days. Few things blow the fog of worldliness
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   away like the loss of a loved one. So come to the cemetery and let your loss teach you
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   wisdom for the brief life that remains. Three, come to the cemetery to rekindle
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   the fires of resurrection hope and the hope of being with Christ in the meantime.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   As you stand beside the grave of the body that will decay, the body that you held perhaps,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   lift up your eyes to heaven and believe the promise that what is sown in dishonor
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   will be raised in glory. Four, come to the cemetery to think, to ponder, to meditate.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   What can I learn from this loss? What would I have done differently?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   What are the implications of this void in my life for my future? What can I learn about God in Christ
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and about salvation and the meaning and purpose of life from this painful vantage point?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It is a rare and precious moment and there is so much to learn.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Five, come to the cemetery to express respect and honor. Was it not a high privilege to have
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   been their friend or spouse or the admirer from a distance of this deceased person?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I want to pay tribute to their value in my life. I owe them so much. By my presence here,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I am saying I honor them. I respect them. I pay tribute to them and to the God who gave me
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   the privilege of knowing them. Number six, come to the cemetery to give thanks.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It is virtually inevitable that we will feel thankfulness welling up in our hearts
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   to those we loved and lost. We would like them to know this, but we know that trying to
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   communicate directly with the dead is a sin. And so all of our thanks is offered up to God
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and he would not begrudge us the prayerful suggestion that he inform our redeemed loved one
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   how we feel. But mainly, we are overflowing with thankfulness to God for their life
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and what it meant for us and still means to us and what a great place to say it and feel it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Finally, number seven, come to the cemetery to be inspired and made hopeful by the promises
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   of God that he will be with you from this day on. He will help us. He will strengthen us.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   He will uphold us with the right hand of his righteousness. He will sanctify to us
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   all our sorrow. He will make us useful in the days to come for the good of others
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and for his glory and for our own joy.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Yeah, there's a recalibration of our lives after spending time among the dead.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. Thank you for the question, Dave, and everyone listening.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Thanks for joining us today. You can ask a question of your own.
