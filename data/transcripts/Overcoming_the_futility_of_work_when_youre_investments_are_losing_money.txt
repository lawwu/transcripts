[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   Hello everybody it's Sam from Financial Samurai. Special episode today, February 28th 2020,
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.840]   because we have just gone through one of the most violent and the fastest correction in
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.120]   the stock market in the history of the stock market. We've corrected by 10% faster than
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.880]   any time in history because we have now seen four back-to-back 3% plus down days thanks
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.440]   to coronavirus fears. So if you're wondering what I'm doing with my money, well I'm buying.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.300]   I always buy whenever the market goes down greater than 2% because generally one standard
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.240]   deviation plus or minus one, the market goes up and down about 1% a day. It's like .8%
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.520]   something like that. So when you see a 2% down day or a 3% down day, it's generally
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.120]   a good time to take advantage. Now the problem with my strategy is that we've seen four 3%
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.320]   plus down days in a row. So my first three purchases are all money losing. But you know
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.400]   what, that's just the way it is. So long as I have some income coming in, I am going to
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.720]   be sticking to my methodology of investing more than normal every 2% plus days. So when
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.920]   we're seeing 3%, 3.5% and 4% down days, I'm definitely buying. Now I don't know when the
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.040]   selling will stop, but if you look at history, the selling inevitably always stops because
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.440]   something positive happens and then we go back to normal. And these corrections tend
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.820]   to happen almost every year. So it shouldn't be a surprise we've gone a very, very long
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.880]   way and correcting is healthy. It will be very interesting to see how central banks
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.340]   around the world coordinate their efforts to try to pump liquidity and bring confidence
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.440]   back to the market. A lot of people say, "Well, that's not going to help given this is a virus."
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.960]   But any kind of confidence from the central banks, just mentioning, "Hey, we're ready
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.360]   to pump liquidity into the system," or "We're ready to cut rates," or "Cut rates should
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.920]   help." Very famous investors such as Warren Buffett with billions of dollars in cash from
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   Brookshire Hathaway saying, "I see this as a buying opportunity. I am going to be looking
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.880]   at opportunities in various industries that should help confidence." Companies that are
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.280]   cash rich like Apple with their $100+ billion saying they're going to be buying should help.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.240]   So you just never know. Everything is yin-yang in finance, so when things go down, bargain
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.400]   hunters come out of the woodwork. I am assuming that global central banks and the Federal
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.560]   Reserve and people with cash are looking for opportunities now. You just never know, but
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.240]   I think something positive will happen. Now on the flip side, we can wake up the very
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.400]   next week and we can have clusters of people exposed to the coronavirus in countries we
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.760]   have never heard of before and we just realize, "Oh, it's just never ending." But I think
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.920]   the more we hear about the coronavirus, the more we get used to the coronavirus and the
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.900]   news and the outbreaks and so forth, and it kind of just becomes part of our daily routine.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.220]   So I'm hopeful that things will get better by the summer. Now one topic that came to
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.120]   mind is the feeling of futility. The futility of going to work or doing your side hustles
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.760]   to make money when you're losing more in the stock market on a daily basis. And this thought
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.260]   occurred to me because I made a commitment in 2020 to try to make some more money so
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.880]   I can go back to early retirement by end of 2022 to spend more time with my kids. Specifically,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.280]   I'm trying to raise $1.5 million more in capital or generate another $6,000 a month in investment
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.960]   income or retirement income to pay for healthcare and inevitable rising education costs, such
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   as preschool. So here I am trying to do some business development on Financial Samurai,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.720]   trying to see if there are any sponsors, new affiliates and so forth. And I'm succeeding,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   but at the same time I'm losing my shirt in my equity investments, which account for about
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.640]   20% of my net worth and is probably going down as we speak because the markets are melting
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   down. And it's a disconcerting feeling. It's a feeling of futility, like why am I bothering
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.600]   trying hard to make money when my investments are just taking me under? Now I was thinking
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.880]   perhaps some of you, or maybe many of you, now that you're listening to my voice, are
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.840]   feeling the same way. You know, why bother going to work to try to pay taxes to the government?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.240]   That's right, it's tax season right now to add insult to injury and try to make money
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.840]   while your investments and your 401k IRA are going down the drain. So I took to Twitter.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   I took to Twitter to see if anybody else feels this way and what they're telling themselves
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.120]   and how they're dealing with it to get some inspiration and some thought. So if you're
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   feeling down, maybe some of these takeaways will help. So Christine Price says, "By working,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.320]   I bring on income that will allow me to invest in the dip." But I think that's a good way
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.920]   to think about it, right? If you have cash flow coming in and you're disciplined, that's
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.440]   great. You can take advantage of this sell-off. Another guy says, Jared at 30-some says, "I
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.040]   just keep it in perspective. I've lost a lot in the markets for the last few days, but
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.200]   overall I'm still positive. Nothing great ever happens without a little struggle. Keep
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.480]   calm and carry on." One guy named Shakiru says, "My couple dollars isn't nothing to
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.600]   what billionaires are losing." So that's some interesting perspective because the mega millionaires
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.880]   and the billionaires own most of our country's wealth and they are absolutely getting shellacked.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.600]   So this wealth disparity that has been widening over the past 10, 20 years, actually probably
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.880]   forever is narrowing as we speak. So that's good. Elsewhere, Nick M says, "You only lose
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.400]   if you sell." That is true, kind of, although it's really painful to see those paper losses
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   and red, red, red when you see the screen. Dave Menzi says, "Frame of reference, we're
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.760]   still up about 20% since the start of 2019." Well, actually, probably only up like 10%
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.520]   now. And he says, "How quickly we forget and adapt to our new wealth normal." And I think
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.160]   that's a really interesting perspective because the Dow has lost all of its gains for 2019
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.400]   already. The S&P 500 is still up, I don't know, 5%, 10% since January 1st, 2019. So
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   we've come a long way since 2019 and we're just kind of going in reverse. So it's funny
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.520]   how used to the wealth we feel and how bad it feels to lose so much money. You know,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.800]   there's a lot of studies that says it takes two times as much gains to feel one time amount
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.680]   of loss. So we just basically feel twice as bad losing money than making money, which
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.560]   is why I've talked so much about the number one rule of financial independence, which
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.360]   is to never lose money because once you've got the money, once you've got enough livable
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.000]   income streams and so forth, you don't want to go backwards. You don't want to lose it
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   because you've tasted the sweet nectar of freedom and you don't want to go to the salt
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.640]   mines. Another piece of advice from Mike Zaccardi, who seems to have a CFA and a CMT, I don't
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.720]   know what a CMT is. He says, "You need to have the mindset of bucketing investment gains
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.920]   and losses and income." And I think that's really smart. So you compartmentalize your
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:10.320]   investment gains and losses and you attribute them to the markets and you make sure they're
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.280]   set up in a proper asset allocation way so that it matches your risk tolerance. And then
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.480]   you just go from there. You ring fence it off. And then your income is your income.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:28.360]   It's dependent on your sector, your performance, your company's performance, and their overall
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.560]   markets as well. So you shouldn't let your investment performance negatively affect your
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.320]   income performance. And I think this is wise advice. Unfortunately, it's really hard to
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.500]   do because your whole net worth is made up of multiple components. And obviously you
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.160]   want to have as many cylinders firing as possible. So this goes back to the beginning of my
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.600]   question. How do you deal with, let's say, performing well in your job or your business
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.540]   but then you're losing money in the stock market, for example. And so it's hard. But
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.000]   trying to ring fence, compartmentalize these two is really, really important because you
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.720]   don't want one to negatively affect the other. They're two separate things. Another person,
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   MS Stange or M Stange says, "I love my job. Today is payday, which means 401(k) contribution
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.640]   with company match." And that's great actually. That's actually a perfect time for payday.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.960]   28th, dump it in your 401(k) and IRA because you should have a long-term horizon. I forgot
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.200]   about this because I don't have a consistent payday since 2012. Jesse Smith Jr. says, "I'm
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.000]   telling myself to keep going and love the process as long as I can be productive, I
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.800]   can make money. I'm too young to worry." And that's great. If you're young, if you're under,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:54.360]   let's say 40, 45, you should be feeling okay. Okay that there's a masker in the market and
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.840]   you should be buying. You should be buying for 10 to 20-year horizons, maybe longer.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.320]   Professor Fireblog says, "The part-time job and consulting side hustles completely eliminate
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.800]   the need to withdraw any funds from my investment accounts. A safe withdrawal rate of 0% is
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.520]   pretty useful when the markets are in panic. It enables me to keep adding to my S&P 500
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.280]   positions with confidence. Therein lies the value." And I agree with that absolutely.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.800]   A 0% safe withdrawal rate is the ideal withdrawal rate in retirement. So you're just living
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.760]   off the income from your investments and you never touch principles. So hopefully that
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.160]   principle goes up over time, which it probably will over a 10 to 20-year time period. And
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.520]   of course we're going to see these yearly 5, 10, maybe 15% corrections and you just
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.960]   got to roll with it. One guy by the name of Guy on a Buffalo waxes on and waxes off and
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.080]   says, "Price is temporary, shares are forever." Which kind of makes sense. Another fellow
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:01.840]   by Basil, "Customers' yachts faulty," says, "Man plans, God laughs." I think that is true
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:10.080]   I guess. A woman by the name of MPD is a mom now, says one of the biggest cliches in investing,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   timing the market is less than time in the market, which I think is true. It always comes
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.760]   back, don't freak out about short-term losses. I think that's true, but if you feel what
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.960]   you feel, you can't help what you feel, right? And then I got a whole bunch of other responses
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:30.440]   if you want to check out my Twitter feed @financialsamurai with no I. And the reason why there's no
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.400]   I in the handle is because there's a character limit. Ah ha. And let me tell you my number
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:45.040]   one way I feel better about the stock market correction is that I look at my children and
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:53.000]   I see how awesome it is that I can fund their 529 accounts on a 14%, 15% correction. Because
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.880]   I had been pretty hesitant about funding my daughter's 529 plan this year, super funding
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.160]   it with 75,000 because the market was at an all-time high. But now we're back to January
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.040]   2019 levels and I'm thinking to myself, "Hmm, this sounds pretty good." So I've been contributing
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:16.760]   to her 529 plan and nothing is giving me greater joy than contributing to her. Not the money
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.400]   that I'm contributing to myself, into my SEP IRA, SOLO 401k, and my after-tax investment
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.880]   accounts, nothing. Nothing feels as good as being able to contribute to my children. And
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.440]   I think the secret weapon that our children have is that they just have time. So a lot
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.960]   of us might be scared or freaking out because we feel that we're losing time or we don't
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.560]   have enough time to gain back or to live the lives that we want. You know, imagine the
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.480]   person who's about to retire this year, lose 15% of their money because they were mostly
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.360]   in stocks. I mean, that's going to hurt. Let's be frank, right? But if you are a baby, if
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.040]   you are nine weeks, 10 weeks old, you're looking at this drop and you're like, "Hallelujah."
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.760]   And so you just contribute to the account because you truly do have 18, 20 years. And
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.600]   so if you elongate the time and you transfer that elongation of time to your children,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.360]   if you're blessed to have children, or maybe it's your nieces or nephews or whatnot, I
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.040]   think that really, really helps during these times of volatility. So that's it, folks.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.240]   I hope this episode has given you some kind of solace and some kind of hope. I'm always
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.200]   hopeful. I'm actually a perpetual optimist and it can get kind of annoying, I got to
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.800]   admit. But you need that optimism, baby, to get to financial independence and do what
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.720]   you really want with your one and only life. So let's hope for good things from those biotech
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.200]   companies and those companies that are looking for vaccines. And let's hope for good things
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.120]   from our great leaders of the world to come up with a plan to give us confidence. And
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:01.960]   let's hope that this virus somehow disappears like we always see in horror movies like War
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.880]   of the Worlds and World War Z and all that just suddenly at the end, "Oh, sorry, it's
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.720]   gone." And let's hope for a V-share recovery. Thanks so much, everyone. Talk to you guys
