[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Though the Legacy Standard Bible is new and fresh it still holds
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.540]   some of that familiarity of the New American Standard Bible but
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.000]   the ways that they are fresh is extremely helpful.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.480]   For instance in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 the Legacy
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.760]   Standard Bible says, "In him we also have been made an
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.560]   inheritance."
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.360]   In the New American Standard it's just we have an inheritance
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.480]   and this helps us zeer in on the fact that we are Christ's
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.040]   inheritance, that he has purchased us, we are trophies of
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.400]   his grace as it were.
