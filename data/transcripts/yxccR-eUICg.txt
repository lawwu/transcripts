[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   "Psalm 28 of David, 'To you, O Yahweh, I call.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.660]   My rock, do not be silent to me, lest, if you are hesitant toward me, I will become
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.360]   like those who go down to the pit.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.900]   Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift my hands
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.240]   toward your holy sanctuary.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.180]   Do not drag me away with the wicked and with workers of iniquity, who speak peace with
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.680]   their neighbors while evil is in their hearts.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.480]   Give to them according to their work and according to the evil of their actions.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.280]   Give to them according to the deeds of their hands.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.040]   Return their dealings upon them, because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, nor the
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.780]   deeds of his hands.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.200]   He will tear them down and not build them up.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.040]   Blessed be Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.280]   Yahweh is my strength and my shield, my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.520]   Therefore my heart exults, and with my song I shall thank him.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.640]   Yahweh is their strength, and he is a strong defense of salvation to his anointed.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.840]   Save your people and bless your inheritance.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200]   Be the shepherd also, and carry them forever."
