[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Is there something else that you've been excited about
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   like reusable rockets perhaps
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.360]   that you've seen in the last few years?
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.480]   - Yeah, well, the reusability,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.800]   you had the reusability is awesome.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.460]   I mean, it's just the best.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.880]   Now we have to remember the shuttle was a reusable vehicle.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.720]   - Yes.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.780]   - Which shuttle is an amazing, it's an aerospace engineer.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.720]   You know, I mean, the shuttle is still,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.440]   this is the most gorgeous, elegant,
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.680]   extraordinary design of a space vehicle.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.580]   It was reusable, it just wasn't affordable.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.360]   But the reusability of it was really critical
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.920]   'cause we flew it up, it did come back.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.880]   So the notion of reusability, I think absolutely.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.720]   Now what we're doing with we, you know,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.440]   like global we, but with SpaceX and Blorgen,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.720]   setting the rockets up, recovering the first stages
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.600]   where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that's huge.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.040]   And just seeing the control,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.240]   you know, being in control and dynamics,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.920]   just seeing that rocket come back and land.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.860]   - Oh yeah, that's--
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.360]   - It never gets old, it's exciting every single time
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.000]   you look at it and say, "That's magic."
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.360]   So it's so cool.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   - To me, the landing is where I stand up,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.600]   start clapping, just the control.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.080]   - Yeah, just the algorithm, just the control algorithms.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.880]   And hitting that landing, it's, you know,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.580]   it's gymnastics for rocket ships.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.160]   But to see these guys stick a landing, it's just wonderful.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.640]   So every time, like I say, every time I see, you know,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.720]   the reusability and the rockets coming back
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   and landing so precisely, it's really exciting.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.560]   So it is, actually, that's a game changer.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.360]   We are in a new era of lower costs
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.760]   and a lot, the higher frequency.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.440]   And it's the world, not just NASA.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.960]   It's many nations are really upping
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.500]   their frequency of launches.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:02.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
