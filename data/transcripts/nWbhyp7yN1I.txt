[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   Did you just say that Apple booted
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.000]   Epic from their app store because they didn't like
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   what Epic said about them?
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.780]   I think that's what he said.
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.700]   Their feelings were hurt.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.620]   They're violating Epic's free speech
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.240]   because they don't like what Epic is saying.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.460]   According to Epic, yes.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.580]   This is crazily heavy handed by Apple.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.380]   Apple heavy handed with developers.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.540]   Have they lost their minds?
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.920]   I mean, this is right out of Power Corrupts
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.960]   and Absolute Power Corrupts.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.000]   Absolutely. Yeah.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.260]   Whatever dispute you have with Epic,
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.760]   you don't boot them out of your app store
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.800]   because you don't like their criticism of you.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.260]   This is basically proving
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.640]   exactly what everyone's been saying about Apple,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.460]   which is they're too powerful and heavy handed.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.840]   And Apple's coming along and saying,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.460]   let me confirm it for you guys
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.300]   by acting tyrannically against Epic.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.500]   Talk about a backfire.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.840]   This seems insane to me.
