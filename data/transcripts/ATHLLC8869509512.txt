[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.520]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.360]   I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.900]   and I'm excited to have Sunil Gupta back again
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.380]   to talk about the ancient wisdom of dharma
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.160]   and ways to incorporate simple
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.760]   and effective daily habits into your life
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.800]   so you can find success and joy in everything you do
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800]   without sacrificing your professional ambition.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.300]   Sunil is a good friend of mine
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.660]   who I met when he was building his startup Rise,
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.840]   but since then, he's run for Congress,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.400]   co-founded the Gross National Happiness Center,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.080]   and just released his latest book, "Everyday Dharma,"
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.800]   which was a fantastic read.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.800]   Money can be stressful,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.380]   but if you wanna find some inner peace
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.640]   from actually knowing how much you're spending and on what
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.200]   so you can be more intentional
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.680]   about your financial decisions,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.680]   you have to check out Copilot,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.800]   which is one of my all-time favorite apps.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.520]   I check it almost every day,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000]   and I'm so excited to finally be partnering with them
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.540]   on this episode after being such a huge fan.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.860]   Copilot makes it seamless and easy to track your spending,
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160]   and in my case, boost your savings.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.520]   I've tried dozens of apps for tracking spending,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.360]   and Copilot is the only one I've kept using.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.520]   You can link it to accounts at over 10,000 institutions,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.760]   and their automatic expense categorization
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.660]   is the best I've ever used,
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.840]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.280]   to make it even better.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.860]   You can completely design your spending categories
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.300]   and subcategories and easily set up rules
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.980]   to assign transactions to them in the future.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.920]   Thanks to Copilot,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560]   I have never had a better grasp
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.440]   of our spending and cashflow,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.900]   which honestly has probably resulted in hundreds
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.720]   or maybe even thousands of dollars of savings each year.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.960]   So for the best app to track your spending,
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.740]   subscriptions, investments, and now real estate,
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.840]   go to allthehacks.com/copilot on an iPhone or Mac
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.120]   to download Copilot and enter code HACKS2
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.080]   during onboarding for a two-month free trial.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.020]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.500]   and the code HACKS2 for a free two-month trial
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.400]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.320]   Sunil, thank you for joining me again.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.060]   - Chris, it's really good to be back.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.560]   - So the whole book you wrote is based on Dharma,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.420]   this concept that's a thousand years old or more
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.740]   from Indian religions and philosophies.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.300]   So I am curious,
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.080]   what is it about this millennia-old concept of Dharma
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   that you thought was so important
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   that people today need to understand it
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.000]   and even practice it?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.080]   - Dharma is a timeless solution to, I think,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.240]   the emptiness that so many of us are feeling right now,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.720]   especially at work.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.600]   Most of us believe that the number one determiner
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.300]   for our mental health is our job.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.840]   And yet very few people right now can actually say
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.520]   that they are enjoying their job
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.280]   on a day-to-day basis, it seems.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   And Dharma is really this way of how do we bring the joy back
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.200]   into what we do each day.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.120]   - And what kind of impact do you think that could have
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.140]   on someone's life?
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.560]   Is it just being happy or does it go beyond that?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.200]   - I think it's more than happiness, at least it is for me.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.520]   It's about finding some meaning in what it is that we do.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.480]   And I know meaning is a big word,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.680]   but I think the way that I sort of look at it,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.240]   and I think that when I go back
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.920]   and I look at the way that my ancestors
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.360]   would think about Dharma,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.040]   there are sort of two kind of ways
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.000]   that we can look at success in life.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.160]   There's outer success, which is wealth and its status
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280]   and its fancy LinkedIn profiles.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.240]   And then there's inner success, which is truly,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   are you enjoying what you do each day?
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.000]   And the point of Dharma isn't necessarily
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.440]   to shame outside success,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.720]   or to shame the idea of wanting nice things
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.920]   or having a career that is ambitious
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.520]   that other people respect.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.160]   What it is saying though, is that we can get all that stuff
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.920]   and still not feel inner success,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.080]   which is really meaning and a sense of purpose in what we do.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.760]   And I know that I've experienced that
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680]   and Chris, you and I have had enough conversations
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.160]   to feel like you, I think to at least a certain degree
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.320]   have experienced that as well.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.600]   Whereas like you were getting the outside rewards,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   you were in jobs that other people found to be interesting,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   but at the same time, it wasn't really lighting you up.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.920]   And at a certain point in time,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.880]   it can be very easy to be walking a path
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.240]   that doesn't actually feel like your own.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.040]   The idea behind Dharma isn't to shun,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   again, the idea of wanting nice things
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.340]   or doing things that are really interesting,
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.880]   but it's more about beginning with inner success.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.920]   What is it that actually lights you up
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.880]   and investing in that even when we are overwhelmed
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000]   with other things in our life, right?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.700]   And I think that's where I wanted to write a book
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.360]   that really challenged philosophy
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.520]   through the lens of today's day and age, right?
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   Fast paced, overwhelmed, lots of comparison.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.200]   How do we bring this concept of Dharma
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.800]   into what's happening today?
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.760]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.400]   You talked about me and I look back
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.060]   and thought about my history and every job I've had,
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.740]   maybe until pretty recently,
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.500]   I just wasn't that excited about long-term.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.180]   I thought, I don't think I could do this job forever.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.140]   And in fact, part of the reason I've been so passionate
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.060]   about personal finance in my life
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.960]   was because I thought I need to save
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.380]   as much money as possible
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.620]   because I haven't found a job that lights me up sustainably.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.660]   Any job would light me up for a period of time.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.300]   Maybe it was six months, 12 months,
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300]   but at some point I thought,
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.060]   wow, am I ever gonna find something
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.400]   that keeps me sustainably happy and excited?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.240]   I don't know.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.040]   And then through a series of trial and error,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.760]   I kind of stumbled into a career now
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.800]   doing something I love
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.960]   that I genuinely think I could do forever.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.000]   And it would have been great
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.040]   if there was a book that I could have read
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.840]   and realized what wasn't lighting me up
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.440]   and what I needed to be focused on.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.680]   But I didn't have that book.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.840]   I didn't have a time machine to find your book,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.920]   but I have you now.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.600]   And so I'd love to talk about it.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.160]   In the book, you broke everything into eight practices.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.080]   So I thought maybe we could run through a few of the ones
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.540]   that I thought were most relevant to this conversation.
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.780]   And obviously if people want all the practices,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.660]   the book is out.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.900]   You can definitely check it out.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.220]   Highly recommend.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.700]   But let's start at the beginning.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.140]   The first one is Sukha.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.180]   And it's all about uncovering your essence.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.020]   And I figured that's a great place to start
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.420]   because a lot of us might have some idea
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.500]   of what we're good at or what we like to do,
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.100]   but they're not really sure how to put that into place.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.920]   - Yeah.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.540]   So Sukha is really about your essence, right?
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.860]   Uncovering your essence.
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.780]   And this is the way that my grandfather
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.140]   described dharma to me,
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.380]   which dharma has been called many different things.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.860]   You'll find different definitions.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.580]   I think one that comes closest is inner calling,
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.780]   but my grandfather called that your essence, right?
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.980]   We all have an essence.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.900]   And the question is, are we expressing that?
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.980]   The key, I think though, Chris,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.340]   and this is where I got it wrong for a lot of years,
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.980]   which is I always assumed that essence equals job title.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.060]   My essence is to be a programmer.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.580]   My essence is to be a product manager or to be a lawyer.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.780]   Those are occupations, but they're not an essence.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.380]   An essence is deeper than that.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.140]   It's I enjoy helping people.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.320]   I enjoy designing things from scratch.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.380]   I enjoy assembling products
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.340]   or growing other people's careers.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.140]   And the idea is that when you can come back to that essence,
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.140]   it opens up a universe of possibilities
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.780]   because there are always multiple ways
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.580]   to express that essence.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.380]   And one of the stories in the book
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.300]   is about a nurse named Karen
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.520]   that really felt like her dharma was to be a writer.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.500]   That's what she wanted to do.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.060]   She wanted to write, but she couldn't afford to do that.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.840]   She couldn't afford to quit her job
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.100]   and she had spent a lot of time
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.140]   investing in the profession of nursing.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.140]   And she was actually doing pretty well as a nurse.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.060]   So she was torn, like I think a lot of us are.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.780]   She was showing up to the hospital, she was doing the work,
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.740]   but she wasn't emotionally connected
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.220]   to what she was doing every day.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.620]   Eventually, the way that she ended up finding her dharma
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.160]   was not by quitting her job and becoming a writer.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.860]   The way she found it initially was by patient paperwork.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.800]   Literally while other nurses and doctors
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.220]   would fill out the clinical details
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.060]   of a patient form and hit print,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.620]   she started to actually write about the patient.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.780]   Who were they?
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.140]   What did they love?
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.660]   How did they spend their evenings?
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.140]   And what really mattered to them?
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.680]   And she would pour these details
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.980]   into these really clinical patient forms
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.020]   to the point that every single one of these forms
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.960]   almost turned into like a mini novel.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.280]   And she would start to pass these forms around the hospital
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.900]   and they would get distributed by others
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.140]   because it really reminded them of the humanity
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.700]   of what it is that they do.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.340]   Now, again, her profession was nurse.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.640]   And that stayed the same.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.660]   She didn't quit her job.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.460]   She didn't make any type of lateral shift.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.620]   But the essence of being a writer
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.380]   was something that she was now bringing
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.900]   into her day-to-day, right?
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.520]   And that's kind of the point of this first chapter of Sukha
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.900]   is if we can dig below the occupation mindset
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.660]   that so many of us have been put into
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.820]   and go deeper into the essence
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.340]   of what it is that you love.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.900]   Ultimately, what is that thing
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.100]   that you feel like really embodies who you are,
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.660]   then you can start to find other ways
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.900]   to express what you do.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.980]   And in the book, I offer some ways
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.420]   that we can start to get to that.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   And the metaphor that I love is Michelangelo
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.140]   would look at a block of marble
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.580]   and he would say the sculpture is already inside.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.460]   I just need to chisel away the layers that are in its way.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.580]   And I think dharma operates in very much the same way.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.260]   I can almost guarantee for you and me
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.980]   and anybody who's listening right now,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.300]   there is an essence that you've already been in touch with
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.580]   at some point in time, right?
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.700]   It could have been when you were a little kid,
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.640]   it could have been last week,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.560]   but you've had brushes, incidents with this essence.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.780]   It may be buried under deadlines, under drop-offs,
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.860]   under all the other things we have going on in our lives.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.540]   And we can start to kind of chisel away those layers.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.940]   One of the ways that we can do that
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.700]   is through good questions.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.980]   I think good questions are an amazing way
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.680]   to come back to who we are.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.300]   One of the questions that I love the most
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.300]   is what would you do for free?
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.740]   If compensation was not a factor,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.580]   what is it that you would wanna spend your time doing anyway?
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.500]   And that's not to say that all of a sudden
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.260]   you can flip a switch and go work for free
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.860]   or that you should work for free.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.460]   But if you can clearly answer that question, right?
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.100]   What's that thing that I would keep doing
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.060]   even if I wasn't getting paid?
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.680]   Now you're starting to get closer
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.700]   to this thing inside of you that wants to express itself
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.100]   no matter how the outside world reacts.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.160]   There are a series of those types of questions in the book
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.600]   that help us get closer to that essence.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.880]   - And these are the chisels, is that right?
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.260]   - These are the chisels, yeah.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.980]   The other thing that I think is really interesting
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.380]   is what I call the bright spots chisel.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.980]   And what I mean by that is in my career,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.460]   I spend a lot of time writing, meeting with people
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.700]   who have succeeded at their highest levels.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.380]   But I spend the other half of my time, I think,
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.420]   meeting with people who are miserable in their careers
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.140]   and helping them come to a place
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.740]   where they can actually do, I think, their best work,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.700]   reach their potential.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.580]   And one of the things that we spend a lot of time
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.900]   talking about is, all right, you don't like your job,
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.460]   but what are the moments,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.460]   what are the bright spots right now in your day
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.080]   that you really, really do look forward to?
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.780]   I don't care how small they are.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.620]   I don't care if they last for literally just a minute.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.020]   But what are those little interactions in your day
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.340]   that are the bright moments?
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.820]   Because misery in a lot of ways can be a very useful tool.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.420]   It can actually illuminate very clearly
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.140]   the parts of your world
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.180]   that you actually want to spend more time on.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.300]   It can be a very useful way to get to the moments
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.740]   that actually bring us joy.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.580]   And so by identifying these bright spots,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.220]   you can start to see a pattern.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.260]   For me, for example,
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.660]   when you and I got to know each other, Chris,
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.380]   I think I was a startup entrepreneur, right?
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.220]   I was working in tech and I'd spent most of the past 10 years
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.180]   really trying to make that work.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.140]   And I guess to a certain degree, it was kind of working.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.980]   I had a startup that had raised some money
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.060]   and it wasn't hitting a home run,
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.580]   but it was doing reasonably well.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.140]   But I think the bigger thing was that
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.040]   I wasn't really enjoying being a startup founder,
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.580]   not nearly as much as I thought I was going to, right?
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.780]   I liked the idea of being a startup founder
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.980]   much more than I liked the act of being a startup founder.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.860]   But the day-to-day of what I was doing and managing
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.580]   and trying to build a product and looking at growth charts
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.820]   and figuring out the metrics,
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.860]   I wasn't that into that, to be honest with you.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.460]   But there was one part of my day
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.220]   that I always look forward to,
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.520]   and that was when I had a chance to hear customer stories.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.500]   Anytime we had a health coaching business,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   we were helping people lose weight,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.040]   then any time that I received an email
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.540]   or I got on the phone with a customer
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.660]   or I could hear some kind of story
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.420]   about how this was useful to them,
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.100]   what their life was like before,
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.540]   what it was like during, and what has changed,
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.540]   that to me wasn't just interesting or validating,
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.940]   it set me on fire.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.460]   The idea of sharing that story,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.060]   whether that be with teammates or whether that be
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.540]   in investors, I could feel literally my body come alive.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.460]   And in the days when I had that moment
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.960]   where I could talk, where I could tell stories,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.140]   I felt alive, and in the days that I didn't,
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.040]   I felt completely vapid and blank.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.260]   So what that told me was, hey, in this job
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.220]   that I know is not for me,
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.800]   I've identified this act of storytelling
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.260]   that I really like.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.900]   That's what convinced me to start sitting
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.020]   at my desk every morning before work to write.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.580]   I'm like, if you like to tell stories,
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.140]   you can just write to a page.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.580]   So I started to write every single morning.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.340]   Those pages ultimately turned into blog posts
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.500]   and then turned into articles and now books.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.100]   - It's interesting how we both went through this arc
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.660]   of startup founder.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.180]   It felt like an identity that suited us,
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.020]   but also at the same time didn't.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.740]   And here we are now both creating content
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.940]   as a future role, which is not what we originally intended.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.140]   And in some ways both stumbled on it.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.420]   When you talk about these questions to ask yourself,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.620]   I'm curious if it's easier to ask yourself
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.300]   or to talk about it with a partner,
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.600]   talk about it with a family member or a friend.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.380]   Do you think one method,
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.700]   or maybe it's different per person,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.740]   but helps you uncover these things better?
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.220]   - That's a great question.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.800]   Yeah, I think the last time we actually hung out,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.140]   we were talking about our partners
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.820]   and how like we would be completely lost
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.580]   in our fricking lives without them, right?
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.700]   And I very much feel that way about Lina.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.100]   I guess there's two things about that.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.780]   One is that I have found it useful
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.820]   to spend some time thinking about things alone
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.620]   before I share with anybody, including Lina.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.260]   And the reason for that is because
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.660]   when I come up with a new idea or a new concept,
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.500]   or I'm like, oh, you know,
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.620]   maybe this is something that I need to start doing
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.040]   or really focusing my time on,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.980]   that idea is always like a newborn baby right out the gate.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.520]   And if you share it too early with people,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.620]   it might be a little too fragile, right?
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.820]   And so the way they respond to that
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.420]   might cut a little bit deeper
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.380]   than it might if you gave it a few days
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.180]   where you could reflect on it yourself, right?
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.020]   And build just maybe a little bit more conviction for it.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.140]   Here's why I'm into it.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.620]   And you can start to poke holes in it yourself.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.980]   So for example, the idea of writing a book.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.780]   Yeah, writing a book is not a great way to make money.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.220]   I knew that, right?
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.340]   Writing a book is not a great way to necessarily,
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.820]   if you want to be known and get your content out there
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.220]   and get your ideas out there,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.960]   you're much better off writing articles.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.060]   And so when I started to think about writing a book,
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.900]   I'm like, all right,
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.380]   I'm gonna spend the next two to three years.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.900]   Nobody is gonna really know what I'm working on.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.620]   I'm not gonna be able to share it with anybody.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.460]   There's a good chance
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.140]   that it's not going to make any money.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.420]   There are all these sort of things in my head
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.860]   and I needed to spend some time myself writing about this
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.040]   before I kind of went out and shared it with anybody,
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.940]   including Lena.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.500]   But then after I did, that's when I opened it up
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.660]   and I went to a few people that I really trusted
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.180]   and said, hey, what do you think about this?
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.500]   But again, I think spending a little bit of time alone
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.220]   in the book I call this non-productive wandering time
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.160]   and really sitting with that idea for a little bit,
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.100]   I think it really makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.740]   - Even if I'm not actively trading all the time,
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.900]   I love learning and even just thinking
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.660]   about the markets and investing,
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.820]   which is why I'm really enjoying this new series
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.540]   called Mastering the Markets.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.020]   The first episode with Ray Dalio is so good.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.560]   He covers early mistakes, managing risks,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.140]   how he tries to predict the markets, and a lot more.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.060]   And the next three episodes are fantastic as well.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.180]   You can find them all on Masterclass,
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.080]   where you can learn from the best to become your best,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.620]   anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace.

[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.740]   for this episode.

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.480]   I love anything that makes life more convenient.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.180]   So if you need fresh groceries for the week
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.900]   and don't have time to go to the store,
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.940]   try grocery delivery from DoorDash,
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.260]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.560]   You'll get everything you want delivered when you need it
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.940]   right to your door.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.100]   With thousands of grocery stores to choose from,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.860]   you'll find the best in your neighborhood.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.140]   And with easy substitutions right in the app
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.220]   and best in class customer support,
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.020]   DoorDash will deliver groceries exactly how you want.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.980]   And if it's not the case, DoorDash will make it right.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.500]   And if you want even more value,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.980]   you can save on all your grocery and restaurant favorites
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.940]   with a $0 delivery fee on all eligible orders
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.420]   with a DashPass membership,
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.740]   which you can get free with so many Chase cards
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.600]   like the Chase Sapphire Prefer to Reserve,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.400]   which is exactly what I did.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.460]   Get 50% off your first DoorDash order up to $20 in value
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.300]   when you use code A-T-H, fall at checkout.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.420]   Limited time offer, terms apply.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.100]   That's 50% off up to $20, no minimum subtotal
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.780]   and zero delivery fees on your first order
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.140]   when you download the DoorDash app in the app store
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.940]   and enter code A-T-H, fall.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.140]   That's A-T-H for all the hacks.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.840]   Don't forget, that's code A-T-H, fall
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.060]   for 50% off your first order with DoorDash.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.500]   There's another hack I think might be useful here
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.260]   that I have found extremely valuable,
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.580]   which is as soon as I started to get more connected
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.860]   with my essence as a storyteller,
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.700]   all of a sudden, this world of options began to appear.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.260]   It was like, oh, you could start a podcast,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.220]   you could write a book, you could write articles,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.380]   you could be on stage, stand-up comedy.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.980]   There are all these different ways
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.940]   that you could express yourself as a storyteller.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.580]   So then the question is, what do I do?
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.140]   Because that's too much stuff.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.040]   I can't do all that.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.940]   And so one of the tools in the book
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.780]   is what I call a Dharma deck,
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.300]   which is anytime something emotionally inspired me,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.380]   I would literally write it down on an index card.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.420]   Go take stand-up comedy class.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.940]   Begin writing proposal for book.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.900]   And I would, over time, have this almost stack
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.900]   of index cards that I felt like were all options,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.900]   all ways for me to express this essence
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.080]   of being a storyteller.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.420]   Then what I would do is about once a week,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.620]   I would go to a quiet place or take a walk,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.620]   and I would take that stack of index cards with me,
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.220]   and I would sort them from top to bottom.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.060]   The ones that had the most emotional pull for me,
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.100]   the ones that were calling me the most,
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.420]   stayed at the top of the pack.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.260]   The ones that didn't went to the bottom half of the pack.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.620]   And what you notice over time is that
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.820]   there would probably be somewhere between one and three cards
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.360]   that will always just stay at the top of the pack.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.060]   No matter what, it's like those are the ones
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.020]   that you don't wanna give up.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.620]   And what I realized is writing a book
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.380]   definitely stayed at the top of the pack for me,
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.300]   and that's why I decided to pursue it.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.140]   - I love this.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.980]   It's funny 'cause I think back to my Dharma,
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.540]   which I haven't quite figured out, or my essence to say.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.660]   I haven't done all the work.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.320]   I've read the book, but haven't done the work.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.260]   But storytelling is a similar one.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.940]   I loved pitching a company.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.640]   I loved recruiting employees,
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.820]   telling them why we're doing this, what we're doing.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.640]   There are many hats you wear as a founder,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.780]   but that one for me was particularly moving,
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.500]   which is funny 'cause now I'm similarly creating content
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.420]   down a different path.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.660]   - This is what you're doing.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.660]   - Back to your example with Karen the nurse,
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.300]   I'm curious, is there some percentage,
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.500]   and there's probably not an exact number,
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.420]   of your job that needs to be associated with your essence
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.900]   in order for it to work?
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.220]   So I think to her example,
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.260]   and if patient intake forms were 1% or 2% of her job,
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.980]   is that enough to sustain the other 98%, 99%
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.460]   that you maybe don't feel as connected with?
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.620]   - Such a great question, Chris,
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.340]   and I haven't been asked that question before.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.780]   I don't know is the short answer.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.780]   What I will say is the difference between 0% and 1%
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.300]   is like astronomical, right?
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.260]   Even having touch points with your dharma each day
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.100]   is, I think, something that can be
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.460]   a complete game changer for people.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.580]   In the case of Karen, this patient paperwork, you're right.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.760]   I mean, most of her time
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.140]   was probably spent talking to patients.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.380]   Very few of it was actually spent
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.700]   writing these patient forms.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.700]   The sense that I get from her and from the other stories
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.940]   that are like this, the assembly line worker
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.860]   who decided that they were gonna actually create
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.460]   a record label, once you start having
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.780]   this touch point every day,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.500]   you start to embody this persona, right?
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.420]   So for Karen, she may have been doing things
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.600]   that had nothing to do with being a writer.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.860]   She wasn't sitting down,
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.200]   and she wasn't actually doing these patient forms,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.980]   but she was meeting with patients.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.500]   One of the things that she was probably doing
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.860]   during that time is starting to think like a writer.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.060]   I wanna hear your story,
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.820]   and so I wanna start asking you questions
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.060]   that go beneath the surface of the symptoms,
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.940]   and I wanna start learning more about your life.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.980]   That was her persona as a writer.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.620]   For me, same thing, storyteller, startup founder,
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.820]   two very different worlds,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.620]   but when I started to connect with myself as a storyteller,
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.180]   I started to feel like a storyteller at work.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.180]   In fact, one of the things that I did
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.180]   is I actually wrote on a piece of paper,
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.140]   "You are a storyteller," and I kept that in my pocket,
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.020]   and anytime I was in a place where I felt like,
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.180]   oh, I feel completely lost right now,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.120]   or I feel like I'm not doing what I'm meant to do,
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.260]   I'd pull out this piece of paper,
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.300]   and I would remind myself, hey, you are a storyteller.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.860]   Now, did that mean that I dropped everything
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.060]   I was doing and went and told stories?
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.500]   No, but what it did mean
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.900]   is that when I went into the next meeting,
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.140]   I could embody myself as a storyteller.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.900]   I had this reminder of, yeah, this is who I am, right?
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.820]   This is what I do, and I'm expressing that
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.660]   in a way that feels maybe a little bit different
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.800]   than somebody who's writing novels or writing screenplays,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.940]   but I can still embody myself as a storyteller,
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.980]   even if I'm doing something
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.300]   that's not completely related to it right now.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.980]   - For people listening to this thinking,
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.820]   how do I take this essence of mine and embody it in my job,
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.460]   it doesn't actually always have to be in your role,
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.100]   and this makes me think of a particular person.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.940]   My wife was at Lyft for 10 years,
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.540]   and there was a guy named Paul,
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.060]   and he always had all energy and could connect with people,
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.940]   and he volunteered and said,
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.180]   "Could I MC all hands for the company?
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.240]   "Could I be the person
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.300]   "that gets everyone excited for the meeting?
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.840]   "I don't need to do all the presentations,
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.580]   "but could I just run the all-hands meeting?"
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.700]   And for almost a decade, he ran the all-hands meeting,
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.340]   and I didn't work there,
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.460]   but I think I probably went to one or two meetings,
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.120]   but it was like he brought that energy,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.140]   but that was 1%, 2%, 3% of his job.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.940]   He had an entire other job,
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.060]   and so whether you're the person
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   that might volunteer to work the booths
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.780]   at the conferences your company goes to,
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.160]   there are opportunities maybe outside of even your role
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.080]   at any company where you might be able to bring some of this
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.820]   and go from that zero to one,
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.980]   so I just encourage people to make it known to your manager
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.140]   what your thing you're trying to do is.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.180]   There might be opportunities you aren't thinking of.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.220]   - Totally, that's such a good point, man.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.060]   Again, I think where we go to,
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.500]   and where I went to for a very long time is,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.900]   well, I need to have a particular job
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.620]   in order to express this essence of mine, right?
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.900]   Again, storyteller, oh my gosh,
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.980]   like that has nothing to do with startup founders,
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.120]   so I need to quit that job
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.180]   and I need to go do something else,
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.820]   but no, I'm not gonna go quit that job.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.860]   I have a team, and we raise a little bit of money,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.120]   I have investors, I can't do that,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.700]   but I can start to find ways to express that
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.800]   through what I'm doing.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.540]   There's another story in the book about a woman
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.980]   who's a project manager inside a tech company,
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.860]   and she really wanted to be a teacher,
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.660]   and she talked to her husband about it.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.900]   They really kind of went back and forth,
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.220]   and ultimately, they found financially,
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.740]   they could not make that work.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.660]   They needed her healthcare insurance.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.980]   She was earning a pretty good salary.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.300]   They needed that to stay afloat.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.700]   The family's based in Detroit,
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.500]   and so she was stuck in this moment where she was like,
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.820]   gosh, I wish that I could've rewound the clock
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.580]   15 years before, and I could've gone down the path
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.420]   of becoming a teacher,
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.900]   because that would've made me really happy,
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.940]   and so every day, that's what was consuming her at work,
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.820]   but when she sat down with a mentor of hers,
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.660]   she was able to dig down to the essence
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.740]   of what it was about teaching
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.660]   that ultimately made her come alive,
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.440]   and what ultimately made her come alive
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.380]   was that she loved helping people grow.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.540]   That's why she wanted to be up in front of a classroom.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.540]   That's what she wanted to be doing, working with students.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.660]   She wanted to be shaping the arc of people's careers,
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.180]   and so the question then became,
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.140]   obviously, teaching is a very clear way
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.100]   to express that.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.340]   What are the many other ways out there
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.980]   that are ways to express that,
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.060]   and what she found is learning and development
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.620]   inside a technology company is actually one way to do that,
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.440]   so she started to throw her hat in the ring
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.240]   inside the same company for these opportunities
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.580]   that would allow her to take what she knew already
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.300]   about what the organization did
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.660]   and start to grow other people inside the company,
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.900]   and so she did and flourished,
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.860]   became a huge rising star inside the company,
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.380]   started to speak on stage about how to develop
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.580]   and grow other people.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.820]   Her career completely bloomed,
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.660]   and she never had to leave the company.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.380]   She never had to shift her industry.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.900]   She didn't have to lose her salary
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.000]   or the healthcare insurance.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.320]   What I love about your show, Chris,
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.360]   I know when I listen to your show,
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.060]   I feel stuck with something,
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.460]   and you offer a way to get unstuck,
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.380]   and that way is not necessarily always
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.780]   the most complex thing,
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.020]   which makes it beautiful, right?
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.660]   There's a lot of beauty in the simplicity of it.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.840]   This might sound really simple,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.980]   the idea of connecting with the fact
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.260]   that she wanted to help people grow
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.420]   doesn't seem like an earth-shattering insight,
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.260]   and that's the beauty of it.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.180]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.660]   There's something inside of you that you can connect with,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.340]   and once you do,
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.220]   it just opens up all sorts of possibilities.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.140]   You asked me for other tactics.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.660]   There's another one that I really love,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.300]   which is what I call the magazine aisle walk,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.740]   and what I love to do is when I feel like
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.420]   I'm trying to explore what it is
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.420]   that makes me come alive, what's my essence,
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.300]   I'll go to a magazine aisle,
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.620]   whether that be in a bookstore or whether it be in an airport,
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.940]   and I'll literally very carefully slowly walk
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.580]   from one side of the magazine aisle to the other,
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.540]   and I will try to tune out what it is
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.660]   that I feel like I should be picking up.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.260]   I should be picking up the Wall Street Journal
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.000]   'cause I should be staying on top of the business news,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.860]   or I should be picking up Harvard Business Review
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.220]   because I need to be staying on top
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.060]   of what's written in that,
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.900]   and I kind of tune that stuff out,
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.500]   and I emotionally connect to
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.500]   what's actually really pulling for me,
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.040]   what magazine covers are really grabbing my attention,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.660]   and slowly, and it's a very slow exercise,
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.500]   one by one, I'll pull out the magazines
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.420]   that are really vying for my attention emotionally,
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.060]   and if I then lay those magazines out on a table,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.940]   I'm like, oh, okay, it's pretty clear,
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.300]   and for me, when I started doing the magazine aisle walk,
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.100]   I was living in Detroit at the time,
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.020]   and I would literally go to this local library,
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.100]   and I would walk from one side
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.340]   of the magazine aisle to the other.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.300]   Inevitably, it would end up being
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.140]   a combination of storytelling-oriented stuff,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.460]   so it would be like script writing, movies, books,
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.400]   but the other that really surprised me was spirituality,
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.340]   and I've never really been a big spirituality guy,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.220]   but I realized that there was a lot that was pulling at me,
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.780]   articles by Ram Dass, and Maria Popova,
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.180]   and Ryan Holiday even,
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.060]   the stuff that they were writing about,
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.060]   like Stoicism, philosophy, and spirituality
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.340]   was pulling me in a really deep way.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.920]   One of the reasons I ended up writing this book
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.340]   is because I was like, wow,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.820]   a combination of getting into this ancient philosophy,
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.900]   and also being able to tell stories
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.880]   that bring that to real life in the modern day,
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.040]   I couldn't think of a better way to spend my time.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.060]   - Well, I'm very fortunate you have.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.000]   We talked a lot about exercise to spend time on,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.680]   time you spend on work, thinking about time,
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.960]   but I wanna move to prana,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.220]   because it's not always about time,
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.760]   so maybe let's jump in here.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.000]   - The definition of prana is this extraordinary energy,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.880]   almost think of a tank of energy that all of us have,
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.960]   but we don't always know how to access that.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.680]   One of the reasons for that
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.400]   is because when we think about investing in a project,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.320]   or investing in an idea,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.040]   the thing that we are so conditioned to think about
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.380]   is like time, right?
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.180]   How much time am I going to give something?
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.520]   And ultimately, what tends to matter most
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.320]   when we look at great projects that have come alive
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.080]   across all these different industries
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.900]   wasn't really time, but it was heart.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.960]   How much heart did you really give that?
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.500]   That's why you see movies like The Clockwork Orange
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.520]   that were written in a few days, right?
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.920]   Great Gatsby, all these great works,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.280]   they were written in a fraction of the amount of time
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.040]   that you might think, because all of a sudden,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.160]   there was this creative burst of inspiration,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.000]   and they were to sit down and just really bang it out.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.960]   And that's proof that what we're really trying
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.720]   to optimize here for is heart, and not time.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.600]   It's much better to be full-hearted with your dharma
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.260]   than it is to be fully scheduled.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.000]   And the example that is very similar,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.800]   I know you've had people talk about meditation on this show.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.760]   I went and spent time at a monastery,
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.280]   and what I was surprised by,
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.480]   I guess I'm surprised now to have been surprised,
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.440]   but at the time, I expected that these monks
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.520]   were sitting around and meditating all day.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.000]   And the truth is, they weren't.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.840]   They were meditating for three or four hours a day,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.960]   but the rest of that time was spent working the land,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.680]   doing all the stuff that they needed to do,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.280]   doing the duties that they needed
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.980]   in order to make the place actually function, right?
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.000]   But their life was dedicated to meditation,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.400]   and the point being that just because
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.920]   you're dedicating your life to something,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.360]   just 'cause you care about it,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.880]   doesn't necessarily mean you're spending
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.940]   every waking hour doing that thing.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.560]   What is more important is that you're finding ways
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.720]   to really bring your best prana,
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.660]   your best energy, and your best heart to those moments.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.640]   So for me, writing for a half hour every morning
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.300]   is way, way better and produces much stronger
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.800]   long-term results than if I was actually spending
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.000]   two hours in the afternoon writing.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.320]   It's just literally the degradation of my brain.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.860]   And it's the degradation of my creative horsepower.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.960]   I can sit down and I can write,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.360]   but it's not gonna end up being any of the pearls
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.920]   that ultimately make it into the book.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.680]   Like 99% of what I write ends up in a trash bin, right?
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.600]   And so what I'm looking for is like these little pearls,
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.160]   these piles of horseshit that I write each day,
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   and it turns out that the little pearls
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.840]   are much more likely to appear
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.720]   in that half hour morning session
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.200]   than a two hour writing block in the afternoon, right?
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.320]   I know that about myself.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.020]   And so for me, my dharma is to write and to tell stories,
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.440]   but it's not like I spend all day every day doing that.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.180]   I've got kids, I've got other work that pays the bills.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.800]   There's a lot of other things going on,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.700]   but I have to make sure to have this commitment.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.460]   The second thing about that then is
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.420]   how do we then condition ourselves
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.460]   so that we have the right energy at the right moment?
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.540]   And for me, this was sort of a big breakthrough,
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.380]   which is that I've always looked at rest and recovery
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.200]   as something that you did in long periods, right?
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.540]   So I would take myself to a breaking point.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.580]   I would take myself to the red,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.180]   and then I would say I need a vacation, right?
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.620]   And my wife and I, we would plan this.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.060]   We'd be like, "Hey, we have this one week vacation
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.700]   "scheduled," and I would literally look at three months
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.780]   between now and then, and I'd kill myself, right?
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.780]   But the problem with that is I would literally return back
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.520]   from vacation with less gas in the tank
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.780]   than before that three month period even started, right?
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.460]   And the science kind of bears this out.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.620]   Most people actually return from vacation
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.260]   and say they're more stressed one week after they return
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.260]   than one week before they left, right?
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.780]   Point being, vacations can be a wonderful thing.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.300]   They're great for reconnecting with family
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.860]   and seeing new places and spending time with friends,
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.340]   but they're actually not as effective an instrument
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.220]   for dealing with burnout than we may assume.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.340]   What tends to work much, much better
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.740]   is when you can actually have frequent focused recoveries
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.420]   throughout the day, every single day.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.380]   In fact, like average high performers,
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.340]   whether it be in business or be in music
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.020]   or be in sports, they're taking somewhere
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.700]   around eight breaks every single day,
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.940]   about one an hour throughout a workday,
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.100]   which I know sounds extraordinary,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.080]   but when I started to put this into practice,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.780]   I used what I call the 55/5 model,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.260]   which is like for every 55 minutes of work,
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.340]   I'm taking five minutes of focused recovery, right?
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.340]   And that five minutes can be doing anything,
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.500]   like literally anything.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.180]   It can be sipping out a cup of coffee,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.100]   it can be doing pushups, it can be taking a walk
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.180]   to the mailbox and back, like doing whatever it is
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.340]   you're doing, but you're not multitasking it.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.460]   You don't have your phone with you when you're doing it
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.820]   and getting some quasi rest and quasi
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.420]   sort of work done at the same time.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.840]   Those five minutes are deliberately nonproductive.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.540]   You're focused on rest.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.100]   And people have a very hard time with this.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.020]   I know I did.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.460]   And the reason for that is because, again,
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.020]   we're in a time-based model.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.760]   We're shrinking the amount of productive time
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.600]   we have in our day.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   We already feel squeezed as is.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.900]   If you're shrinking five minutes from every hour
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.340]   and you're working, let's say, nine hours a day,
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.660]   you're shrinking your schedule by 45 minutes,
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.220]   which is significant, right?
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.580]   We could use that 45 minutes.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.780]   If you give this a shot, what I can almost promise you,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.480]   based on experience from myself and from watching others
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.740]   put this into practice, is that five minutes
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.500]   is gonna make the other 55 minutes far more productive,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.700]   far more effective, far more imaginative.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.100]   You're gonna be far more collaborative.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.720]   Like all the things that we associate with success,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.940]   you will have more of that in the next 55 minutes
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.380]   than you did if you were just waiting
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.020]   to the end of the day to finally unload
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.660]   and burn yourself out because it's just clearly not working.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.540]   - It's funny, as I read this and as you talk about it,
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.460]   I think about how Google has this speedy meetings feature
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.060]   where you can say, set these meetings to 25 minutes for,
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.300]   like a 30-minute meeting is now by default 25
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.440]   and an hour meeting is by default 50.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.920]   But it takes the ability to turn the meeting off at 50
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.500]   because so often it's like,
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.180]   I know no one on this call scheduled the next 10 minutes
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.700]   so we could just run over.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.540]   And then I was thinking about,
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.820]   I remember when I had a Zoom account that was free,
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.020]   there's that timer and it's like,
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.500]   this meeting is going to run out
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.860]   and we are going to turn it off.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.620]   And I've been in meetings like that.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.280]   So if anyone out there knows of a way
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.100]   that I could hack Google Calendar and Google Meet
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   to just actually shut the meeting down at 50 minutes
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.820]   to force everyone to end,
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.900]   I would love to see that feature in action
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.400]   because I find it hard.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   I can schedule the five or 10-minute break,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.180]   but it's really hard to actually take it.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.020]   - You know, it's funny
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.820]   'cause I'm on all these different platforms now
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.020]   for virtual stuff, right?
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.840]   And you are too.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.220]   And I noticed on Microsoft Teams,
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   when they set the meeting for a certain length,
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.580]   they will actually say five minutes left in the meeting
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.900]   and then they'll have a countdown timer.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.600]   Now, I don't think it actually shuts off at that time,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.820]   but the fact that there's actually
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.940]   a bit of a countdown timer,
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.140]   I do find to be somewhat helpful.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.820]   It's like, hey, this is the meeting you called.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.220]   These are the people whose schedule you're dealing with.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.980]   Everybody is assuming this one thing,
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.780]   like let's put a little bit of a countdown timer
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.620]   in the last five minutes.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.500]   I find that to be somewhat helpful.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.340]   But I agree with you, man.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.760]   I was the kind of guy who if I had two extra minutes
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.820]   in between meetings, I would go to my to-do list
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.460]   and I would like, what can I knock out quickly?
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.820]   And to be like a little bit of an energetic hit
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.940]   that I would get from that.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.300]   But the problem was that throughout the day,
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.000]   like clockwork, I would end up slumping, right?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.760]   At the end of the day, I was far less energized
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.100]   than I was at the beginning of the day, right?
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.700]   And that hurt because there were some times
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.220]   where there was key meetings,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.140]   key moments that were in the afternoons.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.820]   I remember when I was raising money even
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.380]   and I was out there pitching investors.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.060]   Some meetings were in the morning when I was fresh,
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:03.900]   but there were a lot of meetings
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.900]   that were in the afternoon.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.740]   I know that looking back, I would be far less compelling
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.620]   in those afternoon meetings than I was in the morning.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.340]   And part of the reason for that is 'cause that morning,
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.060]   I was spent like grinding.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.620]   And then I would walk straight into that meeting
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.380]   and I would take all the baggage from that grind.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.420]   I would take no time to reset myself.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.180]   Maybe if you look at people who like,
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.300]   if you've strapped for time, who do this very well,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.340]   and they don't have five minutes,
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.340]   I think one of the most important things you can do
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.120]   is to provide some type of transition for yourself
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.900]   in between two big moments, right?
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.820]   And again, if you only have 30 seconds,
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.380]   even if you have 10 seconds,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.340]   it is deliberately saying I'm going to be nonproductive
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.380]   for a period of time.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.880]   And the difference between zero and 10 seconds,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.140]   whether it's closing your eyes and taking a breath
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.660]   or literally getting up and stretching,
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.180]   doing something will be game-changing, right?
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.020]   If you're having these transitions throughout.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.260]   - And it's different for everyone.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.940]   For me, the afternoon meetings and the afternoon pitches
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.700]   were actually really great
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.940]   because I didn't have anything to worry about.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.180]   If I go into a meeting at eight, all these things,
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.200]   what came in overnight?
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.140]   What emails do I have to respond to?
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.140]   But by the afternoon,
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.060]   I've been able to catch up on all the other stuff.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.980]   So I think it really depends on a per person basis.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.500]   Sometimes my wife asks,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.820]   "Why were you up till two in the morning last night?"
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.700]   And because we have kids, we got to get up at six to seven.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.100]   The kids are up, we're up.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.940]   And I was like, well, I just had this bout of energy
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.340]   and I felt like I could get done in two hours
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.860]   what I would normally take 10 hours to do.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.980]   But now the hard part is forcing yourself
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.820]   to use that time you saved to actually recover.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.940]   But sometimes when I find this prana,
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.080]   I'm just, I'm like, let's capture it when it's there.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.740]   And sometimes it surprises me.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.780]   - That's a really good point, man.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.740]   We can't always count on prana.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.060]   It's tough to predict
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.400]   when your prana is going to be really high.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.060]   There are patterns for sure.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.100]   I remember when I was at the office day in and day out,
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.600]   I would try to work out in the middle of the day.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.260]   We had a newborn at home.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.500]   The mornings were very tough.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.340]   And when I went home,
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.720]   I wanted to spend time with the family.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.280]   So I try to work out at around 12 o'clock
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.940]   and then I would end up scheduling meetings at one o'clock,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.940]   two o'clock, three o'clock, four o'clock.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.060]   But what I found is that after I finished working out,
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.360]   I felt really good.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.380]   I felt really creative and awesome.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.520]   And I was like, all right,
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.340]   well, why am I scheduling a mundane meeting
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.560]   at one o'clock in that case?
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.340]   I should be scheduling a block of time,
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.980]   at least a half hour where I can get back from the gym
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.100]   and I can go to my desk
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.900]   and I actually can write down a few things
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.100]   that are really important, right?
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.680]   I can spend some time with doing like some deep work.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.600]   And when I did that, that changed things as well.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   And it's a great point.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.780]   Figure out where the pockets of your day are,
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.060]   where you tend to have your highest prana,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.140]   but then also sometimes it'll just happen spontaneously.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.540]   And when it does,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.920]   try to give yourself enough flex where you can capture it.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.460]   - I definitely do that a lot.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:49.520]   If you think eating well has to be expensive,
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.080]   boring, or time consuming,
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.400]   let me share my experience with Green Chef
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.440]   because it's leveled up the food game in our house,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.500]   made things easier.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.080]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.920]   One of the main reasons I love Green Chef
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.960]   is that they focus on making eating well so easy.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.840]   They have nutritionist approved recipes.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   And if you're looking for something keto, vegan,
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.420]   vegetarian, gluten-free,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.720]   they support all of those
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.480]   with more than 80 weekly options to choose from.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.880]   Some recent favorites from us
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.520]   are the mushroom curry udon bowls,
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.880]   which everyone in the house devoured this week.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.000]   And last week, sesame ginger chicken, which was amazing.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.120]   So if you wanna eat clean the easy way
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.520]   with recipes you can make in under 30 minutes
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.600]   that also support your wellness goals
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.720]   without skimping on flavor,

[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.200]   Our partner today is AG1,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.360]   the daily foundational nutrition supplement
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.040]   that supports whole body health.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.560]   I drink it literally every day
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.160]   and I gave AG1 a try
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.600]   because I wanted an easy way
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.480]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   and optimize my immune system.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.620]   And AG1 has been in my routine for over a year.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.960]   Just one daily serving
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.680]   gives me the comprehensive foundational nutrition I need
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.620]   and supports energy, focus, strength, and clarity
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.400]   with 75 high quality vitamins, probiotics,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.440]   and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.800]   So it can completely replace your multivitamin,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.440]   probiotics, and more.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.520]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.000]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.880]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.340]   and energized for the day,
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.880]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.320]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.560]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.520]   with less than one gram of sugar,

[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.820]   effective investment for your health,

[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.460]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.600]   We talked a lot about breaks.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.960]   There's one break that you referenced in the book
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.200]   that I thought was super interesting,
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.840]   and it's a worry break.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.400]   - Yeah, so this one surprised me as well.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.560]   I ran into a leader who had a sand timer on his desk.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.220]   A lot of what I do for work is I go out
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.560]   and I study people who are at the top of their game
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.360]   and I try to unpack their habits.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.720]   And in this case, what he had a reputation for
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   was being very calm,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.440]   even though he worked inside a very cutthroat culture.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.160]   People loved working for him,
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.200]   and he had exceptional results.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.320]   The board loved him, the rest of the C-suite loved him.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.440]   So I wanted to figure out what it was.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.800]   Was he naturally like this, or were there some hacks,
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.400]   some things that he put into practice?
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.140]   And I noticed a sand timer on his desk,
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.240]   and I asked him about it.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.680]   And he said that what he would do
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.560]   is every time there was a worrying thought,
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.200]   something that was nagging at him,
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.920]   and it wouldn't go away,
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   what he would do is he would go into his office
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.040]   and he would shut the door
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.880]   and he would take this five-minute timer
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.240]   and he would flip it over.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.560]   And for five minutes,
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.800]   he would focus on nothing but that one worry.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.660]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.500]   What if it's something
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.160]   that you don't really have control over?
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.080]   He's like, "It doesn't matter.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.720]   "I'll spend five minutes worrying about it anyway."
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.380]   And I was like, "Well, I gotta be honest with you.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.820]   "This doesn't sound great to me.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.800]   "It sounds like a recipe for anxiety
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.380]   "more than anything else."
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.400]   But as I dug deeper into it,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.760]   what I realized is that there's a lot of science
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.280]   behind this practice of taking a worry break.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.760]   And the reason for that is because
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.220]   when we have a worrying thought inside our head,
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.120]   what we tend to do, a lot of us,
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.600]   we'll tend to try to push it out or compartmentalize it
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.440]   and to basically say,
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.740]   "Hey, I don't have time for you right now.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.200]   "I'm focusing on this other thing."
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.920]   When we push things out,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.580]   what they tend to do is they tend to grow louder.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.240]   So what started as a whisper will grow into a conversation
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   and eventually it'll grow into a shout, right?
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.680]   It wants to be heard.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.280]   It's kind of like kids in that way.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   Worrying thoughts want to be heard.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.600]   And if they're not heard,
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.420]   they're gonna continue to get louder and louder.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.960]   There's a saying in positive psychology
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.800]   that you may have heard,
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.860]   which is what you resist persists.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.200]   Counterintuitively,
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.320]   while we may think we're doing ourselves a service
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.280]   by trying to push these thoughts out
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.740]   because they're not positive,
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.120]   we're actually giving them a lot more runway
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.000]   inside our head.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.280]   They're actually becoming louder and louder.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.100]   One of the things we can do is we can actually say,
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.360]   "All right, I'm going to give you a fixed amount of time.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.560]   "I'm gonna sit down
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.680]   "and I'm gonna give this nagging worry
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.060]   "five minutes of my time.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.680]   "For that five minutes, I'm gonna stay true to it.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.420]   "I'm literally gonna do nothing but worry
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.400]   "about this one thing."
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.060]   And strangely enough,
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.920]   what will happen at the end of that five minutes
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.600]   is that it won't be that the worry went away.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.960]   You may not have a problem for this.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.200]   It might even be something you have control over.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.320]   But what it will do in almost all cases I've noticed
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.780]   is it will actually turn the volume down on the worry, right?
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.440]   So that now you can actually get on
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.900]   with the other parts of your day
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.640]   because it felt heard, right?
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.780]   Because it wasn't something
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.160]   that you were trying to push out.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.720]   You gave it its due time
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.880]   and now it settles a little bit more.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.720]   - I love this.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.560]   It's almost like you can exhaust the worrying
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   where you're like,
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.600]   "Well, I don't have anything else to say to worry about it."
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.100]   And maybe the next time it goes away.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.540]   So on a higher note
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.620]   than kind of worrying about the worst in the world,
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.660]   let's talk about kind of elevating things
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.740]   to be a little happier, a little more exciting.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.820]   Let's talk about Leela.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.180]   - So Leela, really think of it
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.620]   as the blend of work and play, right?
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.980]   And how do we start to think of work
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.700]   a little bit more like play?
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.040]   And it sounds probably cheesy, right?
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.980]   And I know the first time I thought of Leela
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.300]   and I started digging into this really ancient practice.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.820]   I'm like, "Well, that sounds very lovely,
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.180]   "but doesn't sound quite practical, right?"
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.860]   You work hard and then you play hard.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.660]   That's the mentality we've been brought into.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.180]   But then I started to see these really top performers,
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.460]   people like Phil Jackson, NBA coach,
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.700]   but it was also a player
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.880]   who literally, as he was a player,
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.100]   wrote in his locker room on a piece of Scotch tape,
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.980]   "Make work your play and play your work."
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.340]   And that was the mentality
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.540]   that he brought into the NBA as a coach.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.900]   And look at what he did.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.460]   One of the most winningest coaches of all time.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.860]   He raised greats like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.380]   Those guys, when they talked about Phil Jackson,
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.780]   they would talk about that philosophy in particular,
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.740]   and they would say that is the thing
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.440]   that they ultimately ended up learning the most from him,
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.820]   which was to blur the lines between work and play.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.420]   Because when you do,
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.900]   you can actually reach even more exceptional results.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.280]   In all the concepts in the book,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.860]   I really tried to find where it was echoed.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.700]   These Eastern concepts that were over 1,000 years old,
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.760]   where, like, what was happening in the world of science
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.220]   and what has happened in the world of science
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.940]   that provides some grounding for these.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.180]   And in all cases, I could find something.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.740]   In this case, for Lila,
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.940]   it really came from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.500]   in his work around flow.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.660]   If you look at the state of flow,
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.280]   what he was really talking about in many cases
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.620]   was being able to feel like even though you were working,
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.600]   there was a notion of play that was associated with it.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.260]   One of the things that Csikszentmihalyi
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.180]   made a distinction of
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:15.060]   is people who tend to be exotelic versus autotelic.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.220]   And exotelic means that they are focused purely on the goal,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.520]   the result of the work they're doing.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.260]   But the people who are autotelic
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.300]   were the people who were focused on the process
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.900]   and enjoying the point from here to there.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.980]   And the assumption that I think a lot of us make
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.420]   is that the people who achieve the top of their game
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.980]   are exotelic by nature.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.540]   By the way, we're a blend of all of them.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.580]   We're not one or the other.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.960]   We kind of tilt one side or the other.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.300]   But the assumption that we, I think, make sometimes
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.980]   is that people who achieve the medals,
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.340]   people who get to the very, very top,
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.580]   are the ones who are exotelic, right?
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.460]   They're the ones who are focused on the prize.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.980]   That's what they really want.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.140]   And they will not rest until they get it.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.060]   What Csikszentmihalyi, I think, did an exceptional job of
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.860]   in his body of work around flow
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.660]   was showing how there was just as many people out there
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.780]   who tended to tilt autotelic, right?
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.300]   Who tended to focus much more on enjoying the process,
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.720]   getting some joy out of that.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.780]   Because when you got joy out of something,
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.540]   you wanted to keep doing it over and over again.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.620]   So one of the techniques that we talk about in this chapter
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.260]   is what I call high quality habits.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.140]   And the business that I had started before
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.860]   really focused on health habits.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.240]   How do we build health habits into our life?
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.380]   One of the things I realized is
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.540]   when we were trying to get somebody to lose weight,
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.580]   and they loved bread and they loved pasta,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.720]   but they decided to go on a carb-free diet,
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.700]   it would last for a short amount of time.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.060]   And sometimes you would see people
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.420]   who got exceptional results quickly,
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.100]   but it very rarely lasted, right?
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.540]   Almost entirely on all cases that we studied,
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.500]   we work with tens of thousands of people,
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.060]   they would end up yo-yoing back
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.900]   to the condition they were in before.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.060]   On the other hand, when we found people who adopted
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.540]   what I call a high quality habit,
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.700]   which is a habit that they want to do over and over again,
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.400]   they actually love the habit.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.300]   For example, drinking two glasses of water
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.380]   before every meal, which is a habit
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.180]   that some people can get really into.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.220]   It can be really fun.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.220]   You can put little mixes into your water, electrolytes.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.780]   You can have cool looking bottles.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.460]   It can become part of your persona.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.000]   And there's a lot of fun that can come from that.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.200]   People who were able to adopt that habit,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.260]   we saw end up having lasting results
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.820]   because they were eating less,
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.740]   they were having more energy throughout their day, right?
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.980]   And it was something that they just wanted to continue with.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.620]   I think the same is true for our dharma.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.460]   There are certain things
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.900]   that we want to bring into our lives
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.740]   that we're like, I don't really want to do that,
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.460]   but I feel like I should do that.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.580]   And those habits very rarely stick.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.580]   But on the other hand,
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.100]   finding something that you really enjoy doing,
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.420]   something that you want to do over and over again.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.620]   I think it was Kevin Kelly, and I quote him in the book,
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.020]   and I always butcher his quote,
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.460]   but he's like, we spend so much time in our lives
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.260]   trying to figure out better ways to do tasks.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.480]   What we need to be doing
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.100]   is we need to be spending time in our lives
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.340]   figuring out what tasks we want to do over and over again,
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.260]   because we actually love it.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.160]   And when you can find those things,
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.780]   when you can find those habits,
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.780]   you're on a clear path to learning this line
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.980]   between work and play.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.380]   - And in the health example,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.860]   I'm sure cutting carbs would probably be more effective
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.460]   than just drinking two glasses of water.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.060]   So- - In the short term, yeah.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.900]   - In the short term.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:18.740]   But I guess in the long term,
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.820]   if you bring it back, the water is more helpful.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.340]   - Well, that's exactly what would happen.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.800]   The platform that I started was called Rise.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.020]   You're matched with a health coach.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.500]   So you had one person that you were working with.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.300]   And the number of people who had cut carbs
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.260]   and then gained it all back,
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.720]   it became like almost cliche to talk about,
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.680]   because it would happen all of the time.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.860]   People who went on paleo and lost 30 pounds
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.620]   and they felt fantastic
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.740]   and then ended up gaining it all back.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.340]   We saw that, I guess, way more often
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.020]   than the people who were actually able to keep it up.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.320]   The point of this all isn't to knock on paleo.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.440]   The point of it is if you're suffering
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.140]   as a result of paleo, right?
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.660]   If you really like carbs, it's something you enjoy,
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.240]   and you're denying yourself that,
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.960]   then that is not a high quality habit,
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.900]   because it's not something that you want to put on repeat.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.380]   And so for that reason, it makes it much, much harder.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.220]   It's a sick do.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.900]   You're basically cashing in on your willpower
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.300]   every single day, which is a very hard thing to do.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.160]   And it becomes even harder
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.220]   when you have other things going on in your life.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.860]   You're busy, work picks up, things are happening at home.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.080]   It becomes even harder to keep a high quality habit.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.780]   On the other hand, something like water,
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.500]   again, to your point, it's not the kind of thing
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.340]   you're going to shed weight with very quickly,
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.760]   but it's the kind of thing
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.600]   that you can keep in place over time.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.540]   So the people that we saw that not only lost the 20, 30 pounds
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.260]   that they were looking to lose,
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.020]   but actually kept it off,
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.840]   were the ones who adopted these really simple habits
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.100]   that they actually really wanted to put on repeat.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.980]   - So dieting, sports,
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.500]   how does Leela fit into a more traditional workplace?
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.860]   - I think Leela fits into traditional workplaces
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.860]   when we can start to find the little things
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.580]   throughout the day that actually give us some joy
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.640]   and also help us find our dharma.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.760]   So for me, for example, with the storytelling,
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.220]   finding little pockets, little moments of the day
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.740]   when I was actually sitting down
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.780]   and I was actually writing,
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.540]   just for five minutes every day, right?
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.560]   Five minute pockets throughout the day.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   I was sitting down and I was starting to spend some time
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.580]   actually writing these ideas, right?
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.060]   And there were these little pockets of joy.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.500]   That was a habit that I want to put on repeat.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.540]   The other one that I feel like is really helpful
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.460]   was when I talk about Toni Morrison,
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.220]   who is a single mom.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.180]   She had two kids at home.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.300]   She had a full-time job,
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.420]   but she really wanted to write.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.060]   And for her, the high-quality habit
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.300]   started when she started waking up a half hour early
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.820]   before the kids were up,
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.420]   and she'd have her cup of coffee,
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.980]   and she'd watch the sunrise,
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.100]   and she would just brainstorm and daydream
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.460]   about the ideas that I would want to bring to life
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.280]   through a novel.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.000]   She would really just start to write these ideas down.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.040]   It's not like a book happened immediately,
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.240]   just the same way that if you were drinking water
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.720]   throughout the day every day,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.400]   you're not gonna lose weight immediately.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.080]   But those mornings, that high-quality habit,
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.120]   ended up being all the inspiration
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.240]   that she ended up turning into her books,
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.020]   became a Nobel Prize-winning author
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.600]   as a result of those mornings.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.140]   So what is that thing for you
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.760]   that you feel like you enjoy so much?
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.920]   And again, it's not like something
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.480]   that you feel like you have to do,
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.320]   but you actually want to do.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.560]   And how do you then start to build that into your day?
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.680]   In some small way, whether that be in the morning,
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.720]   whether that be sprinkled throughout your day,
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.360]   what's that thing that you feel like you can put on repeat?
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.480]   - It almost feels like if Sooka is finding your essence,
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.800]   Leela is bringing your essence into your daily routine
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.120]   so that it feels more like fun.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.480]   - Well said, man, because I think that we talk a lot.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.600]   Whenever I think there are conversations
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.280]   about purpose and meaning, sometimes we can tend to focus
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.880]   on finding what that thing is for you,
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.200]   and maybe not enough time talking about
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.800]   what it is that we need to do in order to fit this
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.360]   into a busy, overwhelmed, fast-paced, modern schedule.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.680]   And I think Leela is one of those answers.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.240]   - And I think it tees us up perfectly.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.100]   I wanted to last talk about Kriya,
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.320]   which is that if you don't actually take action
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.440]   on all of this, what is there?
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.360]   So maybe let's close there.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.800]   And we didn't hit on all of the principles.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.040]   We didn't hit on, I don't even know how many rituals
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.480]   and tactics you put in the book, but there were so many.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.080]   So obviously there'll be more
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.720]   that people need to go find elsewhere,
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.160]   but this felt like a good way to wrap it all up.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.280]   - There's over 30 rituals in the book,
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.880]   and I look at this as, in some ways, like a menu.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.520]   Like there are things that are going to work
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.080]   for some people, and there's things that are gonna work
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.200]   better for other people, but being able to test
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.880]   these different things in your life,
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.120]   I think are the ways, the paths that we can use
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.600]   to, I think, figure out what it is that makes us come alive
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.480]   and express that.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.480]   With Kriya, with action, nothing happens
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.040]   unless we have movement, right?
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.720]   We can sit behind a desk and we can talk
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   about purpose all day, but how do we put purpose into action?
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.360]   And the thing that I love about Kriya
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.160]   is that there are really some great tools today
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   that I had to figure out.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.080]   When I started to put them into practice myself,
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.640]   it really started to change things for me.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.200]   And one example of that is the two-way door
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.640]   versus the one-way door.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.360]   And you may have heard Jeff Bezos talk about this
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.760]   because he talked about it in a couple
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.320]   of his shareholder letters.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.000]   But basically, the premise is that oftentimes,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.600]   when we are thinking about a decision,
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.200]   taking action on something that we want to go do,
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   it is very easy to confuse that as a one-way door,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.440]   meaning that if you go through and it doesn't work,
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.640]   you're not gonna be able to come back through
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   when it's actually a two-way door, right?
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.000]   You go through, doesn't work, you're able to come back
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.520]   to where you were before, right?
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.400]   You may have lost a little bit of time,
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.240]   but you probably gained a lot of information
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.160]   and a lot of experience along the way as well.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.880]   But the bigger point is that oftentimes,
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.960]   we treat these decisions with such weight
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.520]   and with such gravity that if we do it,
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.240]   it's like we're walking into an abyss
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.800]   where we have to make it work when the reality is
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.040]   there will be other options.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.480]   Other doors will open, plus you will always be able
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.320]   to walk back through.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.520]   And so for me, running for office was that thing.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.200]   I felt compelled for a while to move back
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.480]   to my hometown outside of Detroit and run for office.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.200]   And I was really scared about it.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.560]   And I was scared for a lot of reasons,
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.800]   but one of them was I felt like if I did that,
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.440]   I was gonna torpedo my career.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.240]   I'd spent 10 years in Silicon Valley,
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.960]   I'd been working as a startup founder,
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.560]   I'd developed all these relationships,
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.080]   and I felt like I'd finally found a way
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.400]   to financially make a place like San Francisco work,
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.200]   and here I am, I'm gonna torpedo all that
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.760]   and move back to Detroit and run for office.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.280]   But I really wanted to, I really wanted to get involved.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.160]   But at the same time, I felt like it was gonna
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.240]   blow everything up.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.560]   And it wasn't until I really started to think about it
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.880]   as like, hey, listen, this is not a one-way door.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.240]   Like you go and you lose,
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.040]   there will be other doors that will open.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.600]   And if they don't, for whatever reason,
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.520]   you will always be able to walk back through, right?
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.720]   And what you will have lost may be a little bit of time,
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.280]   but what you will have gained is a lot of wisdom.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.000]   And you'll never regret not having done this thing
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.920]   that you were emotionally pulled to do.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.560]   That is ultimately what got me through.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.280]   It wasn't some burst of courage.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.120]   People would always feel like that's a very gutsy thing
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.000]   to run for office and to leave everything behind
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   and go do that and move your family to Detroit.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.080]   And I was like, well, I thank you for saying that,
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.920]   but not really.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.320]   For me, it really came down to this idea.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.000]   I actually don't have a lot of courage here.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.640]   I am very scared, but I'm also grounded in the idea
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.340]   that if this doesn't work,
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.760]   I'm not going to be in a place of complete pointlessness.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.280]   I can come back through the door
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.880]   because it is a two-way door.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.440]   I can always move back to Silicon Valley
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.760]   if that was what I chose to do.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.780]   I can always go back into working into tech.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.440]   It may take a little while to find something, but I will.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.240]   I have to have some belief in that because it's true.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.000]   Ultimately, the other thing that might happen
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.360]   is it may open up many other doors for me,
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.660]   which is kind of what happened.
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:41.800]   I went to Detroit.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.960]   I gave it my all.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.080]   I knocked on over 10,000 doors.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.900]   Election results come back in and I lose.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.480]   But as a result of that, everything had changed.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.340]   I had learned so much about myself in that process.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.320]   I learned about what I cared about.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.680]   I learned about what I want to spend my days doing.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.620]   At the end, I was like,
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.400]   I don't want to move back to Silicon Valley.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.920]   I want to start getting on stage
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.520]   the way that I was during the campaign.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.860]   I want to start speaking to audiences.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.320]   I came up with the idea for a television show,
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.640]   which I'm now making with American Express.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.080]   All that stuff happened when I was on the campaign
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.480]   and really as a result of doing that.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.280]   So again, the thing that I would encourage
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.200]   anybody who's listening right now,
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   take a decision in your life.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.400]   Just take a decision that you're thinking about,
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.560]   something that maybe you're afraid to do,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.320]   and ask yourself deep down,
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.440]   is this a one-way door or is this a two-way door?
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.600]   Because there are some one-way doors out there, right?
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   But the vast majority of decisions out there
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.480]   are not one-way doors, they're two-way doors.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.520]   And if it's a two-way door,
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.480]   the only thing I would say is,
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.680]   lower the bar a little bit, right?
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.480]   Don't feel like you need to have
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.560]   this abundance of courage or guts
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.340]   in order to go do this thing that you want to do.
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.840]   Instead, ground yourself in the fact
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.020]   that even if you do it and it doesn't work out,
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.080]   you're going to be okay.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.520]   You can always walk back through.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.080]   - I think far too many people think
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.640]   decisions are not reversible.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.520]   And I watched a great talk on speed
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.160]   when it comes to building products and building companies.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.760]   It's like, if a decision is reversible,
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.840]   just make the decision.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.800]   Almost default to a decision
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.200]   and then you can come back to it later.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.520]   But another tactic you mentioned that I really liked
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.400]   was to make a to-do less hard, less to overcome,
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.560]   make it a to-learn.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.880]   Maybe share that a little bit.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.080]   - I spent like so many people every January 1st
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.000]   coming up with, here are my to-do lists for the year,
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.360]   here are my big goals.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.040]   And like many people, I would abandon that list,
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.280]   stop looking at it sometime in February.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:36.440]   And what I found to be much more gripping
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.480]   and I think compelling for me
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.760]   was when I started to think of it less as a to-do list,
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.440]   but a to-learn list.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.280]   What are the things
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.080]   that I actually want to learn how to do right now?
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:47.680]   Here's where I want to grow.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.040]   And for me, even though it's a little bit hard,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.560]   it makes it just far more exciting.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.080]   For example, I wanted to learn
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.880]   how to develop a television show.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.080]   And when I write that down, all of a sudden,
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.120]   it opens up all of these ways that I can do it.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.240]   But I think the most important thing it does for me
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.800]   is it makes me less afraid to fail, right?
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.720]   Because we all know that failure is a wonderful teacher,
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.240]   right, and success can be a really lousy teacher.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.960]   And so if my to-do list is,
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.680]   I need to have a show up and running
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.720]   by the end of the year,
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.880]   all of a sudden I'm like jammed with fear and insecurity
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.360]   to the point that I actually don't want
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.840]   to look at that goal anymore.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.800]   But if my goal is to learn how to develop a show,
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.680]   then I know that I need to put myself out there,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.560]   right, I know I need to actually start doing the work,
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.400]   I know I need to start meeting with people,
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.320]   I know I need to start getting into the nitty gritty
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.240]   of what it takes to actually pull something off
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.000]   in Hollywood, but it no longer makes me so afraid
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.720]   of going out there because I know I'm gonna probably
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.960]   fall on my ass a few times while I'm doing it,
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.400]   and that's okay because I'm actually satisfying
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.040]   this to learn objective,
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.280]   which is I wanna know how to create a television show.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.200]   - It's funny, I think especially even going back
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.760]   to the beginning of this conversation
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.480]   on finding your essence,
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.800]   just learning more things can help you explore,
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.880]   and so I think back to one of the reasons
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.240]   I partnered with Masterclass was that I found it
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.880]   to be such a great tool to go watch videos,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.240]   be like, I like storytelling, do I like stand-up comedy?
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.840]   Let's go learn what it takes
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.040]   to actually do this professionally.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.360]   What, I don't think that's me.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.200]   I like telling jokes, but I don't think it's a career,
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.600]   and so I think the more you can expose yourself
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.060]   to learning other things, the more you can come up
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.680]   with ideas of what ignites you and what doesn't,
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.320]   and it's so much easier.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.560]   That would have been a much easier thing to do
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.160]   than do a stand-up routine, which is a loftier goal.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.760]   Maybe I would learn more from it,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.400]   but even just learning how the industry works
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.320]   was a much easier goal to accomplish
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.920]   from the safety of my own living room.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.440]   - Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.420]   - So I feel like we didn't even brush the surface.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.600]   There's a lot more there.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.720]   Where can people get the rest?
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.280]   - Yeah, so the book is out.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.400]   It literally just came out yesterday,
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.680]   and you can find it everywhere.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.600]   It's on Amazon, it's on Barnes & Noble,
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.800]   wherever you get your books.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.440]   It is available in print and audio as well,
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.100]   and it's called "Everyday Dharma."
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:01.940]   - Awesome.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.600]   Did you do the audio, or who's reading it?
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.160]   - I did, I did the audio.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.040]   And it's funny, I recorded it at this booth in Santa Monica,
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.080]   and a lot of what's inside the book
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.680]   are the stories of my ancestors.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.640]   I tell the story of my grandfather
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   in our first conversation about dharma,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.280]   and it was just a bizarre experience, Chris.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.480]   It's funny because I started to cry
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.800]   during the actual reading,
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.720]   and a sound engineer was kind of in my ear,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.800]   and I got my headphones on,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.760]   and I realized he's crying as I'm reading it as well.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.280]   So if you hear me breaking up
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.960]   during the audible recording at a point,
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.360]   it's because I'm weeping.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.840]   - Wow, I feel like now I gotta go back and listen
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.000]   to try to find those moments.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.920]   But thank you so much for writing it.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.480]   I love all the tactics.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.960]   I think anyone listening to this show
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.760]   knows that one of my passions
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.060]   is not just learning about how to make change,
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.920]   but the specific actions and tactics,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.240]   and in the case of your book, 30 plus rituals.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.980]   So really loved that, really enjoyed the book.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.440]   Thank you so much for sharing it,
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.520]   and joining me today.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.680]   - Chris, this is awesome.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.520]   Thank you.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.960]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.720]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.200]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.600]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.320]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.760]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.140]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:17.440]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.480]   That's it for this week.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.640]   I'll see you next week.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.760]   (electronic beeping)
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.840]   (electronic buzzing)
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
