[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   In 1997, David Bowie issued what was then famously called the Bowie Bond.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.520]   It was $55 million that yielded 7.5%, which is about 80 bips above the tenure at the time.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.120]   The bond payments were linked to 20 albums that Bowie had released before 1990.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.360]   And what he basically said was, "You're essentially buying a piece of me, and I'm going to take
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.600]   this $55 million up front, and you're going to get paid this interest based on the royalties
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.200]   that I generate off that historic library for a 10-year period."
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.320]   And it turned out that it was an incredible bet.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.000]   This was the first example, I think, of people monetizing themselves, their name and their
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   likeness.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.880]   Today, what's happening is a more sophisticated version of that movement, but at much larger
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.880]   scale.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.620]   And I think what the DJT company, what it represents is effectively a trading coin,
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.960]   a baseball card, if you will, a trading card via a stock on the value of Donald Trump's
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.280]   name, his recognition, and his likeness.
