[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.680]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.340]   My name is Joshua, I'm your host, and today I'm going to share with you one of my heroes,
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.760]   one of my career heroes specifically, and share with you a little bit about his life
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.960]   and his story in hopes that it may also inspire you.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.360]   I believe that it's important to have heroes, people that you look up to.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.000]   These can be heroes writ large, people that you would like to be like in most things,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.840]   or it can be people that you admire for something specific.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520]   But I believe one of the healthiest personal habits that we can develop is to go through
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.920]   life looking to find things that we admire and look up to about other people, the way
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.120]   that other people behave, the way that other people live their lives, the kind of person
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.240]   they are.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.120]   And even if those specific things that we can find to appreciate about somebody, even
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.400]   if they're quite small and there's maybe more things that we would not like about somebody
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.940]   rather than appreciate, rather than the things that we do, I believe that this practice is
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.900]   one of the healthiest things that we can possibly do.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.060]   It's healthy for you and for me as individuals because it helps us to develop a positive
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.060]   outlook on life.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.340]   We go through life being a good finder rather than a fault finder.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.260]   We go through life treating people well, treating them as human beings who have something that
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.020]   we can learn from them, something that we can appreciate about them.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.340]   And that allows us to see the world in a vastly different way than people who go through life
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.660]   seeking to be critical of others, trying to find things that they don't like about others.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.580]   And I think it also has the wonderful effect of kind of a ripple effect in society that
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.620]   as we go out looking for the good in people, looking for the things that we can admire,
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.980]   the common ground that we can have, it leads to a more positive relationship with somebody
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.020]   and it leads to other people feeling more appreciated, feeling more admired, feeling
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.440]   more respected.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.980]   And these are all things that will boost their self-esteem, their self-confidence when they
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.340]   sense that from us and generally make the world a better place.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.220]   But I think it's also just a really good selfish habit to get into because when you go around
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.260]   looking for things that you admire in other people, you wind up systematically building
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.440]   a clearer and clearer vision of the things that you want to be able to admire about yourself.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.080]   And this gives you, at its core, goals.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.620]   It gives you aspirations, ambition.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.540]   It gives you something to want to be.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.500]   And even if you and I are imperfect in actually achieving our goals, the fact that we have
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.540]   goals, the fact that we're working towards something, and especially the fact that we're
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.460]   working towards being the very best version of ourselves that we're capable of being,
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.800]   is, I believe, a positive aspect that can affect us in a very positive way.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.780]   And so I try to make note of things that I admire about other people.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.460]   And as I said, sometimes I can admire another person quite broadly, right?
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:29.580]   I admire my father and I would very much like to be like my father in many, many ways.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.580]   But not all.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.580]   And I think that's fine.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.980]   There may be other people that I would find vastly more things that I don't admire about
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.100]   them, but I can still find a few things that I appreciate about them.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.420]   I don't have to agree with them.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.340]   I don't have to...
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.660]   I just focus on the good, right?
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.620]   I focus on the things that I do admire about them.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.820]   And since people are often the easiest for us to observe, because we see them as humans,
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:05.300]   as creatures like us, especially if we can learn to facilitate our brains admiring relatively
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.260]   normal people, not just airbrushed figures on the big screen, but admiring people that
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.260]   we know, right?
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.300]   Our family members, our neighbors, our co-workers, just ordinary people like us, then it helps
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.180]   us to see real lives.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.020]   And by the way, it's important that we do that because these are the people that we
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.240]   actually know.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.980]   These are the people that we can actually understand who they are, their character,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.940]   their way of living, etc.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.220]   But today I'm going to share with you a little bit of one of my heroes.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.460]   I have many again, but I was just inspired to talk about this hero today because of,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.840]   frankly, his music.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.180]   And this particular hero is Bill Gaither.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.780]   I'll explain in a moment who Bill Gaither is and why I admire him, because I think that
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.060]   in Bill Gaither's career, you and I can find some very important lessons to integrate into
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.480]   our own lives.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.740]   If you've listened to more than a handful of episodes of Radical Personal Finance, you
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.240]   know that virtually every episode I open with that little statement, how to live a rich
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.160]   and meaningful life now while also building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   less.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.480]   And you'll notice that there is a dual mandate.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   There is a goal of living a rich life now in every sense of the meaning of the word
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.040]   "rich."
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.840]   And there's also the goal or the mandate of building financial freedom.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.480]   Now you'll notice I don't use the term "financial independence."
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.400]   And it's not that I don't appreciate financial independence.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.600]   I'm very grateful for all of the significant measures of financial independence that I
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   have been able to achieve.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.320]   It's not that I don't want financial independence for more people, even in its fullest sense,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.240]   the sense where you have more money than you need or will ever want to spend the rest of
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   your life.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.800]   Thus, you can truly live your life without regard to generating money for need.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.960]   I want those things, but I'm not so keen on certain aspects of the financial independence
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   movement.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.440]   It's not that I wish to tear it apart.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.160]   It's that I feel like certain people fixate too much on financial independence.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.840]   I saw a post on Reddit, in one of the Reddit financial independence groups this past week,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.120]   and it was written by an 18-year-old.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.400]   And the 18-year-old, to summarize what he was saying, was basically saying, "I've
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.000]   decided I want to be financially independent.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I've saved $10,000.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I think, actually, sorry, it was something like $5,000.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I've saved $5,000.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.960]   Can someone tell me what to invest in so I can be financially independent as quickly
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.800]   as possible?"
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.720]   And it struck me because I recognized myself in that Reddit commentator.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.640]   I realized that if somebody had come to me at 18 years old or at 20 years old and laid
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.200]   out financial independence as a goal, I would have been asking the similar question.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.520]   In fact, I was asking similar questions in various message boards, not at 18, but more
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.680]   at 21, 22, etc., because I was working a job I didn't like, and I wanted to get rich
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.340]   quick so I could get out of it.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.340]   That was my goal.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.800]   Today, I look at it, and I, my heart, it's too hard, I just, I look at it and I think
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.660]   that 18-year-old, I feel bad for him, right, because I think that's a fundamentally horrible
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.000]   way to approach life.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.480]   And again, it's something that I did.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.720]   But the concept that at 18 years old you would be looking to get out of work, I see as a
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   fundamentally flawed concept.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.440]   It's a horrible way to approach life, to think that here I am at 18 years old, presumably
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.000]   I'm debt-free, I've got $5,000 in the bank, literally the world is open to me and all
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.240]   I can think about is getting out of work.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.920]   All I can think about is how do I save enough money so that I don't have to work.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.940]   When I'm at the very dawn of my life and I've got decades, God willing, that lie in front
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.600]   of me in which I can accomplish great things, I can live a great life.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.440]   But I think what happens is it all comes down to what heroes does that 18-year-old have.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:22.920]   When I was 21 and I was asking those questions in online message boards, I was choosing certain
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.680]   heroes but without thinking about all of the options that were available to me.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:37.360]   And I think that if you recognize that there are many paths open to you, then, and you
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.760]   choose a different hero who's walked a different path, it can give you a different model, a
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.240]   different way of living.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.060]   So to wrap up my comments on financial independence, I see financial independence as a valuable
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:56.380]   step along the way, a valuable goal that expresses a measure of achievement, but not as something
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.760]   that should be the top goal or a primary goal of life.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.680]   I think there are other goals that will give more lasting satisfaction than simply achieving
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.680]   financial independence.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.220]   And I think that if you can recognize and develop a career hero, whoever that happens
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:20.120]   to be for you, it'll give you an idea of how not that you can get out of work, but rather
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.280]   you can lean into work.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.280]   Let me tell you a little bit about Bill Gaither.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.160]   And for context, these are just things that I know from listening to a lot of his music
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   over the years.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.480]   I've never met him.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.620]   I've been to one Gaither concert, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I have no intimate
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.620]   connection to him.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.400]   This is publicly available data.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:46.360]   Bill Gaither is well known in the evangelical Christian culture in the United States as
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.520]   a singer, songwriter, producer, band coordinator, band leader, etc.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.640]   And he's simply well known due to his age.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.760]   Yes, his chronological age.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.160]   He's currently about 86 years old.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.880]   But more important, due to his age in the industry.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.240]   According to his Wikipedia entry, he started performing in the mid 1950s, which would have
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.600]   put him as a teenager, was when he started singing and performing.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:23.640]   And that means that he's had a career of basically over 50 years actively performing and actively
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.360]   being involved in Christian music in the United States.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.680]   And so he's quite well known for that.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.600]   He's also well known because at various times in his career, he did a lot of television
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.120]   and he would run a lot of advertisements for concerts and things, selling DVDs on television
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.280]   on Christian channels and other channels.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.800]   So people came across him and so his name would be well known.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.300]   But if it's been a while since you've thought of Bill Gaither, he's probably extraordinarily
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.720]   different today than you think he was, than the image you have of his 1980s television
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.800]   commercials or his 1990s music.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.080]   So let me share with you some things that I really admire about Bill.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.880]   First I admire his longevity in the arts.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:18.440]   I admire the fact that he's been working diligently for 50 years, more than 50 years.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.720]   Sorry, it's actually, sorry, I did my math wrong.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   Forgive me.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   More than 70 years.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.080]   From the 1950s was when he first started performing as a musician until now in 2022.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.720]   It's over 70 years he's been working actively in his career.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.200]   And while I don't know anything specifically about his personal tour schedule, I don't
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.960]   know how many months of the year he works, I do know that he does still work a lot.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:47.560]   His band tours, they are continually producing new albums, new music.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.880]   He's very active in his YouTube channel, etc.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.160]   He is still working hard.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.560]   He's still producing music and still generating new fans today.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.360]   And he's done that for an exceedingly long period of time.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.080]   And I believe that a major secret to financial abundance, as well as a secret to high quality
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.200]   life is to try to choose a career that you can have for a very long time.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.800]   If you can imagine yourself working for 70 years, think of yourself getting a job and
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.380]   starting to work at 18 years old.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:33.440]   Add 70 years to that, and Bill is almost, again, he's 86 now, so you do the math.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.000]   But 60 or 70 years and you just work.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.400]   Think about the money that you can earn and the money that you can accumulate over that
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.840]   period of time.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.800]   One of the great errors that we make is we often cut off our earnings too soon to actually
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.160]   accumulate significant amounts of money.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.540]   But if you imagine that Bill is working at 86, still earning excellent money, increasing
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.440]   his family's fortunes at a time when many other people would have quit 20 years previous
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.600]   at 66.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.560]   Even if he was broke at 66, there's no reason for him to be broke at 86.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.460]   You say, "Well, Joshua, yeah, I get that, but why would I want to do that?"
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.740]   Well, I think the key is find a job that you don't want to retire from.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:21.100]   And here, when I look at the arts, I often find examples of the kinds of career lifestyles
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.840]   that you don't want to retire from.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:29.000]   If you think about the job of a performing artist, to me there's something exceedingly
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.740]   attractive about the job of a performing artist.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.100]   First, we know that it's hard work.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.120]   Anybody who's been on the road or worked, we know that it's hard work.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.820]   But I think one benefit of the kind of work that an artist has, when an artist goes on
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.580]   the road and does a tour, is that it's a form of seasonal work.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.980]   You may have a three-month tour through 30 states or 10 countries or wherever you're
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:59.060]   traveling, and during that period of time you're working hard, but that's not 365 days
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.060]   a year.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.260]   It's not 50 weeks a year.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.020]   There's a seasonality to it.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.780]   And over the years, I've admired, I've expressed my admiration for seasonal work again and again
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.780]   and again.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:15.460]   But in the modern age, when we're not connected so much in our work to the flow of the seasons,
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.100]   we miss the benefits of seasonality.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.920]   We miss the idea of having a rest during the wintertime.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.700]   And then when the weather gets well and we can go out and we can break the ground, we're
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.500]   just thrilled to be outside in an agrarian society.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.460]   Well, not having that, we just work all the time.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.260]   We sit in offices that are climate-controlled.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.420]   We sit in houses that are climate-controlled.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.760]   And so we work without regard to the weather outside, without regard to the elements.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.380]   We plan our work with very little regard to the seasons.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.780]   And most of us don't have work that is seasonal in small chunks.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.320]   Most of us have work that can be done all year long.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.100]   But when I think about the idea of having a career where, say, I go on the road for
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.100]   three months at a time, and then I go home for three months on the time, and then maybe
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.960]   I go on the road again for three months at a time.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.660]   That fills me with a sense of desire.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.780]   It's like, yes, I want to do that.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.980]   I want to work hard for three months, and then I want to rest for three months.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.700]   It feels more attractive to me than work 50 weeks a year.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.420]   I think there are many careers in which you can have this.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.780]   It's not just musical artists.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.700]   It might be a sports player.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.860]   A football player might have the games of the season, you have preseason, et cetera,
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.060]   but you have significant periods of rest.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.180]   A teacher might have this, with an extended summer vacation.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.080]   There are many jobs, many businesses that can have this.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.380]   You might be an accountant, and you filter your work based upon your seasons of tax seasons
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.220]   and tax filing deadlines, et cetera.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.100]   You might be a snowboard instructor.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.920]   There's so many ways you can do it.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.740]   But if you could have some sense of seasonality in work, I think that's really attractive.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   I think that the seasonality allows you to really work hard during that season.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:00.900]   I find that when I'm working and when I'm in work mode, working long hours is a joy
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.980]   because my creativity is flowing, but then I need to make sure that I flip that for a
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.980]   serious season of rest.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.700]   But I don't want to rest all the time.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.980]   I need to get back to work.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.220]   I admire the seasonality of a singing career, a touring career.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.540]   Another thing I think is worth noting about somebody who is a musical performer is their
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:27.420]   job is varied, but their most important results come from their area of core genius, meaning
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.860]   we know that if you are the leader of a band like Bill Gaither is, or if you're a producer,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.660]   et cetera, there are many responsibilities that he has.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:48.700]   But a singer's most important results come from his ability to create wonderful music.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:55.220]   And for a singer to build his career upon singing, he's going to need to feel confident
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.860]   that he has something really good to offer, and the marketplace is recognizing that.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.700]   And so when you do something that you're good at and you feel like you're good at, and you
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.740]   know that you're good at it because the audience responds and says, "Here's our money.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.740]   Take our money.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.620]   We want to listen to you," and you have good proof of it, it allows your work life to be
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.020]   far more joyful.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:24.460]   And when you know that you're operating an area of skill, an area of genius, an area
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.940]   where people appreciate your work, it dramatically transforms how you feel about your work.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.460]   It's not to say you're always going to be enthusiastic about it.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.060]   A performer will frequently feel tired.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:42.580]   A performer will frequently not look forward to a performance.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.500]   But a performer knows when he goes on stage, he's doing something that he's good at, and
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.060]   he's doing something that people appreciate.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.340]   Even if it's on a big scale or a little scale, he knows that he's doing something that people
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.780]   appreciate.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.020]   And if you continue in the career, there's lots of people who've tried to have bands
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.500]   and it hasn't worked out for a few years, but if you can build a career in something
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:08.020]   where you have longevity because there's desire there, I think you can get a tremendous sense
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.140]   of satisfaction out of your work.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.340]   That's one thing I admire about singers and other performers.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.800]   But you don't have to be a singer or performer in order to do that.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.540]   You can just be really competent and skilled and be working in an area of your core skill.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.600]   It might be creating a podcast.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.480]   It might be being a coach.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.360]   It might be being an accountant.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.700]   It might be any number of things, being a teacher.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:36.220]   But knowing that you are in an area where you are effective and where you are good brings
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.240]   a great deal of satisfaction.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.540]   If most of your time or your most important results are related to something that you're
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.700]   skilled at, it gives you the ability to deal with the rest of the stuff.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.540]   I'm sure Gaither has many days where he has to go to the office and have meetings and
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.860]   look over the books, etc.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.180]   We all have that.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.200]   But that should be a minor component of your time.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.780]   So if you imagine a career in which, let's say 80% of your time and your most important
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.340]   80% of results are based upon things that you're skilled at and you're good at, I think
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.500]   those are some things that are really, really valuable and really, really important.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:18.920]   The next thing that is, I think, important about Gaither's career is that he has been
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.820]   able to grow with his career.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.940]   So I mentioned that I was inspired to do this based upon his music.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.020]   He's actually been on my list for a long time and I've had this list of show ideas.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.540]   This is the first in the series that I've done.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:43.180]   But I was playing for my children at bedtime some of my favorite songs, some of my favorite
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.260]   Gaither songs related to Easter.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.220]   Every night when I put my children to bed, I sing to them.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.180]   Usually we sing, we do a hymn study so I sing a certain set of hymns.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.420]   I sing throughout the month so they can learn them.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.960]   We sing some other songs as well.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   So we do that.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.380]   But when there's a special event, if it's Christmas or Easter or some other holiday,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.780]   then I'll bring in some other music.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.500]   So my brother sent me a playlist of some of his favorite songs related to Easter.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.700]   My brother and I share a significant amount of musical taste and most of them are by the
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.460]   Gaither vocal band.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.260]   So I was playing those for my children, just realizing how much I like the music.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:31.020]   But the music is very different than what you might have seen on TV in the 1990s.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:38.940]   The music is phenomenally built music, but it's all sacred Christian music.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.140]   But the performers are world class.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:48.340]   David Phelps, who has sung with Gaither and solo as well for many years, is world class.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.300]   So many other singers are world class.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:57.180]   And what Gaither has done over the years is he has been able to change his sound.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.040]   He's been able to change with the times.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:09.620]   And so in 2022, I'm still a relatively young man, I can without fear say my favorite band
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:15.740]   is the Gaither vocal band and not have the fear that, well, I guess it's a little bit
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.780]   of a fear, but just know that it's not the same thing as it was in the 1980s.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.200]   I enjoyed the 1980s music, but I wouldn't go around saying I'm a fan of that.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.300]   And so you see that they've been able to grow as musicians and change and adapt with the
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.460]   times.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:38.540]   And for me, at least for my musical taste, they found a really wonderful balance of bringing
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:46.900]   things that I appreciate about classic music, meaning really phenomenal musicianship, really
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:53.820]   phenomenal singing, really wonderful harmonies, etc., but with a modern sound and in a really
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.900]   quality way.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.900]   And so I think that this is a key thing to look for in a career.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.220]   Do you have a career or can you develop a career that will allow you to grow and to
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.300]   adapt?
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.700]   And I see this as having multiple benefits.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.300]   The first benefit is it keeps you relevant in the marketplace.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.660]   Imagine that you were a computer technician in the 1990s, but you didn't keep your skills
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.660]   current.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.380]   You'd be out of luck, out of a job.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.420]   Virtually all of us will be completely, we will have to completely reinvent ourselves
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.620]   a couple of decades from now.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:36.300]   And so the key is can we find ways to choose a career that will allow us to take our core
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:43.380]   skills and competencies and then adapt them as our industry changes so that we will maintain
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.620]   relevance and will continue to have customers.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.740]   I'm a professional speaker.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:59.500]   Professional speaking is going to have relevance 20 years from now, even if I'm doing it in
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.340]   a currently unimagined way.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.600]   And I'm a financial planner.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.300]   Financial planning is going to have extreme relevance 20 years from now, even if the deliverables
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.260]   are totally different, the products are totally different.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.340]   It's a fundamental part of life.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.340]   You may be a doctor.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:24.380]   Well, people are going to need a doctor just as much 20 years from now as they do today.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.780]   And so you want to make sure that you have a career that's going to stay relevant and
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.700]   a career that you can change and adapt to so that you can stay relevant in the marketplace.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:40.620]   Bill Gaither has been able to stay relevant as a musician for almost 70 years.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:46.660]   But his relevancy is based upon his changing in the marketplace.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.660]   He has a core competency of singing, musicianship, et cetera.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.260]   We'll get to his songwriting in a moment.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.920]   But he has a core competency, but that core competency can change on the edges in order
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   to stay relevant.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.580]   And that means that he can continue bringing offerings to the marketplace and stay current.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:10.780]   If he were singing the same songs, the same style today in 2022 as he was in 1990 or in
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.980]   1960, then nobody would be interested in him.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.600]   His career would be dead.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.100]   But because he's adapted and changed over time, his career is very much alive.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:27.400]   Then the flip side is that the individual also benefits.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.420]   Gaither himself benefits by staying relevant in the music industry because it keeps him
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.420]   challenged.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.300]   At its core, no doubt he loves music.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   Clearly he loves music.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.780]   Musicians love music.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:47.020]   And yet music has an infinite number of ways that it can be expressed.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.380]   And so for a musician, one of the biggest benefits of staying in the career is that
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.540]   you can change and you can try different styles.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.940]   You can adapt to different things.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.940]   You can adjust as time goes on.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.440]   And you can keep that sense of challenge.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.540]   As humans, we need challenge.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.460]   When you feel like you've conquered everything, what, am I able to die now?
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.700]   But if you feel like, no, I can get better, I can adjust, and you have a new skill that
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.140]   you're working on, a new way that you're seeking to improve, that helps you to feel alive.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.140]   It helps you to feel young.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.140]   It helps you to feel engaged.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.940]   So you want to be thoughtful to have a career that will keep that sense of engagement with
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.940]   you.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:32.660]   The next thing that I admire about Bill Gaither is that his career is one that has allowed
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:38.220]   him to really grow into an elder statesman.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.700]   And I think it's so valuable for you and I to think forward 20 years, 50 years, 80 years,
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:51.020]   and ask ourselves, how can I be relevant 20, 40, 50, 80 years from now?
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.220]   And what you will need to do if you're going to be successful in that is you'll need to
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:05.500]   grow into the role of some form of elder statesman where you now bring a sense of, now you bring
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:11.460]   genuine wisdom, you bring character, you bring experience to the marketplace.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:20.780]   And then as your previous qualities fade, you replace those qualities with a new quality.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:28.140]   And here I want to juxtapose Bill Gaither versus Madonna.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:34.460]   I was really surprised with the video that Madonna released recently on her social media
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.740]   feeds.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.060]   And I don't follow pop music.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:44.460]   I literally couldn't without Googling, excuse me, without asking the duck, I slipped out.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:52.380]   Without doing a web search for Madonna's songs, I could not list a single Madonna song.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.380]   But I know who she is.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.100]   I know she's a performer.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:01.820]   And it's my impression of her career from a great distance that she built her career
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:11.940]   off of her music and a significant component of her music and the attraction of her music
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.340]   was based upon her youth, her beauty, her sex appeal.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:23.820]   But then I saw this video that she released of what seemed to me, I got to look up how
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.820]   old Madonna is.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.300]   All right, found it.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.140]   Madonna is 63 years old.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:41.300]   And so here was this video of her at 63 years old, basically trying to do this like sexy
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.980]   kiss thing at her phone.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.540]   And I found the whole thing utterly repulsive.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.260]   And I don't use that word lightly.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:58.580]   In fact, one of the opinions that I have, a little speech that I frequently find myself
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:05.820]   saying to women, is that I think that one of the worst things about American culture
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:12.780]   is the idolization of youth, physical beauty, and sex appeal.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:20.220]   Because what happens is, I think it's a really destructive thing in our culture where we
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:29.940]   say that your value in society for young women is 80% driven by your physical attractiveness.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:35.780]   And that our definition of physical attractiveness is a definition that is usually most idolized.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:44.500]   Ideally created by those who are between about 18 and 22, where their body is well-toned,
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.780]   their breasts are fully developed, their skin is perfect and clear, etc.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:55.900]   And I think this is such a destructive tendency in society, because what it means is that
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:02.220]   once a woman passes the height of her youthful sex appeal, then it's just all downhill from
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   there.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.460]   And you get these stupid things like, you're not supposed to ask a woman how old she is,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.500]   and all these ridiculous things like, well, I'm turning 30 years old, minus 20, or whatever
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.660]   the dumb ways that women say it.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.860]   And I think this is really destructive in a society, it's really bad for the mindset
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.780]   and self-confidence of many women.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:27.180]   Because instead of having an aspiration of something to grow into, where I admire cultures
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:33.920]   that have a cultural sense of honor for the aged, there are many cultures where people
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:41.620]   look forward to growing older because they will receive higher and higher levels of honor
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.060]   from the society around them.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.700]   And I think that's really healthy and right, and that's how it should be.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:52.500]   We should honor the aged, we should respect the aged in many, many ways.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.180]   And yet our American society, we've very much lost that.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.100]   And we disrespect the aged, we make jokes about age.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:08.160]   None of the jokes are positive, they're all hurtful, they're all cutting, and is it any
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.940]   wonder why people don't want to grow old?
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:17.140]   And so, sorry for the comment, but for me to say that I was repulsed by Madonna because
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:26.340]   she's 63 is not a comment on saying that age is bad.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:31.460]   It's a comment on saying that the 63-year-old should not be trying to reach out to the world
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.340]   in the same way that an 18-year-old is.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:41.320]   Set aside whether an 18-year-old should be trying to create a sexy video on whatever
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.740]   social media platform is in vogue, the point is that it's deeply hideous for a 63-year-old
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.300]   to be doing that.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:56.340]   A 63-year-old should be embracing wisdom, a 63-year-old should be embracing the role
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:03.380]   of, in Madonna's case, a mother, a grandmother, an advisor, a mentor.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:09.720]   And there are so many performers and actresses who do this, and they're beautiful.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:15.900]   They're beautiful outside, but they're outside their external beauty flows from them being
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.700]   a beautiful person, a beautiful soul.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.940]   And then when we see them aging, we admire how graceful and how beautiful they are in
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.580]   their aging process.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.820]   And it doesn't matter the number of wrinkles that they have or the amount of fat on their
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.740]   thighs or anything like that.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:39.700]   We admire them because they have a sense of decorum, a sense of gravitas, a sense of wisdom
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.180]   and age and just respect for themselves.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.800]   So back to Bill Gaither, right?
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:51.660]   I was thinking about Madonna in comparison to Bill Gaither, and I was thinking, Bill
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:58.380]   Gaither, he is not the same musician that he was many years ago.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.280]   There was a time when Bill Gaither was a singer, right?
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.420]   He is a singer.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.220]   He sings constantly.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:12.540]   But there was a time in which his voice was a fundamental part of the performance.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:20.140]   Bill Gaither today has a reasonable voice where he can stay on tune, but he's never...
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:26.700]   And when he sings and when he solos, you are drawn to him, but you wouldn't listen to him
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.260]   and say, "Oh, he's got this world-class voice."
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.600]   He's not David Phelps.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.740]   He's not Josh Groban.
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:38.260]   He's not that kind of voice.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:45.280]   It's a perfectly reasonable, attractive, fine male voice, but it's not anything distinguished.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.520]   And yet it doesn't matter.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:55.200]   So similarly, Madonna is not in any way attractive, in the sense that she's not distinguished.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.680]   She's not ugly, but she's not distinguished by her voice, sorry, her looks.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.820]   But if she chose to say that, "I'm going to embrace my looks for what they are and develop
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.420]   these other attributes of my life," she would be, in my opinion, much more attractive.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.500]   Just like Bill Gaither, he's a very attractive person, even though his voice is no longer
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.640]   the star voice.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.660]   So what has he developed?
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.100]   Well, he's developed those other qualities.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.260]   He's developed those other skills, those other things.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:35.220]   So one of the things that he's really good at over the years has been finding young talent
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.380]   and then developing and launching that young talent.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:46.860]   Let me read a few names, and if you are familiar with evangelical Christian music in the US,
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.780]   then some of these names will be quite recognizable to you.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.040]   If not, they're many of them well-known performers.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.420]   But here's from his Wikipedia article.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.420]   "Gaither has been a father figure and career booster to many younger performers in the
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:06.220]   Christian music industry, while helping to prolong the careers of those who came before
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.620]   him, for example by producing homecoming recordings and tours.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:15.740]   The following are all CCM artists who either got their start or became popular while touring
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.340]   with the Gaithers.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:25.620]   Mark Lowry, Michael W. Smith, Carmen, Sandy Patty, Steve Green, Don Francisco, Amy Grant,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:31.100]   Michael English, Jonathan Pierce, Carla Worley, and Cynthia Clausen.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.940]   He has maintained the Gaither vocal band with a variety of singers through the years, including
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:42.940]   Gary McSpadden, Steve Green, Lee Young, John Moore, Larnell Harris, Michael English, Lemuel
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:49.740]   Miller, Jim Murray, Mark Lowry, Terry Franklin, Buddy Mullins, Jonathan Pierce, Guy Penrod,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:55.820]   David Phelps, Russ Taff, Marshall Hall, Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles, and Reggie
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.820]   Smith.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.380]   Penrod, Lowry, and Hampton were the members of the Gaither vocal band with the longest
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.060]   tenure besides Bill Gaither himself."
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:12.340]   So what you can see is that he has built skills of finding young voices, young talent, and
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.940]   then I would assume coaching those young voices and young talent.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:23.740]   I'm sure that he's coaching musically, being influenced by the younger voices and talent,
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.460]   and then also coaching the younger voices and talent, coaching in terms of everything
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.380]   related to a music career.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:38.860]   And so here he is at 86 years old and he is leading the performances of some of the most
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.900]   phenomenal vocalists in the world in that particular niche.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.500]   And so he's just as relevant at 86 as he was at 26.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.940]   And yet it's because he's adjusted and adapted to the changes and he's developed more skills
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.180]   around the edge.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.100]   He understands.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:06.820]   And I think this is really important to recognize, that many of us have talents or things that
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.140]   will fade with time.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.300]   If you make a living performing delicate surgery with your hands, you're not going to be able
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.940]   to do that with the same level of confidence 80 years after you begin.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.060]   But that doesn't mean you can't be just as relevant in your industry.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.180]   You have to simply think and begin with the fact that, "Hey, I'm going to change.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.860]   This is going to develop."
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:34.020]   If you're earning your living based upon your physical beauty, your physical beauty is going
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.040]   to change as the years go by.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.300]   And so what other things can you bring in addition to physical beauty or your voice
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.100]   or anything?
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:51.900]   And so I just find it so inspiring to watch a current Gaither video of a wonderful song
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.700]   and see Bill Gaither singing there.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.460]   I can't pick him out in the music.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.980]   I can't hear his voice because he knows that he's playing a backup role.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.260]   But he's hosting the event.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.020]   It's his name on it.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.480]   He's hosting the event.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.500]   He's making the jokes.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.740]   He's leading, but he's profiling the stars.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.780]   And that keeps him relevant.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.040]   And I think it also keeps him exceedingly young.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.860]   When you look at him, he's blessed with a wonderful head of hair.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.660]   I assume he colors it.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.940]   I don't know.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.060]   It's great brown.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.020]   He doesn't allow his hair to go gray.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.860]   But he just is a very young 86-year-old.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.740]   He's a very young 86-year-old.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:37.140]   And I think that part of that must come from being around young people.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.400]   I think that this is also something that we need to watch out for is don't allow yourself
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.900]   to be segregated with old people when you're old.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.100]   I don't think we should segregate young people exclusively with young people when they're
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.100]   young.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.340]   And I also don't think we should segregate old people when they're old.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.860]   We need that cross-pollination.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.420]   Old people need to be around young people so that they maintain that sense of energy
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.900]   and optimism and enthusiasm.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.600]   And so they maintain the young, fresh ideas.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.940]   And you can see this even in Gaither's performances.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.940]   He's adapted.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.620]   They have a huge YouTube channel.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.460]   He's adapted himself to the world of YouTube, to the modern expressions of music.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.940]   They figured out ways to continue to make it as a musician, even as the music industry
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.700]   has utterly transformed itself.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.180]   And I admire how they've been able to stay current.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.260]   I think it's really wonderful.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.460]   And I think that it must provide him with so much satisfaction to recognize the role
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.780]   that he's played in so many careers.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.620]   I've always been inspired by people who can help launch other people.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.500]   I've always wanted to do that myself.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.580]   How can I use what I have to launch other people?
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:58.260]   And I love that Gaither has accomplished that.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.740]   What else do I admire about Gaither?
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.260]   I don't know much about his family life, but I do know that he's married.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.340]   His wife's name is Gloria, and they have been married for a very long time.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.540]   And they have worked together in their career.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.820]   This is another thing that I think is really wonderful.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.940]   Gloria is an incredible songwriter.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.580]   They say that they write their songs together.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:28.380]   I don't know what their creative process is, but they're wonderful songwriters and have
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.340]   written more than 700 songs together.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:40.580]   Many of those songs are really part of the modern Christian core.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.380]   I'll share a few titles right here from his Wikipedia profile.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.980]   Gaither and his wife Gloria have written many songs, including "The Longer I Serve Him,"
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:54.460]   "Because He Lives," "The King is Coming," "Sinner Saved by Grace," "Something Beautiful,"
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.380]   "He Touched Me," "It Is Finished," "Jesus, There's Something About That Name," "I'm Gonna
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.700]   Sing," and "Let's Just Praise the Lord."
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.420]   His songs have been performed by Christian artists—David Crowder Band, Carmen, the
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.940]   Imperials, Sandy Patty, the Cathedral Quartet, the Spears, and Heritage Singers; country
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:15.020]   singers, the Statler Brothers; and pop artists—Elvis Presley.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:21.700]   So there's just wonderful impact, and those songs will live on.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.180]   I will sing for the rest of my life, "Because He Lives."
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.480]   I will sing for the rest of my life, "Jesus, There's Something About That Name."
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:35.600]   It's a song that my parents sang to me every single night of my childhood, and it's a song
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.580]   that I sing to my children regularly.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.900]   And so those songs are part of my life, and songs are the kind of thing that will continue
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.460]   throughout generations.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.580]   And I think that's something worth admiring.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:55.700]   Can you create something that has some chance of continuing to influence people in a positive
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   way?
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.700]   It's not to say that they're going to know your name, right?
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:05.060]   We all have songs that we love that we don't know who wrote them, and even if we did, it's
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.540]   just a name.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.700]   But I think that when you think about being on your deathbed, right, the idea that you
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.660]   could create something, that you could do work and create some kind of work that could
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:25.340]   continue to help your fellow man, continue to minister to your fellow man in some way.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:33.460]   Right here I see on the Wikipedia, it says, "A video of a man surreptitiously recorded
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:37.960]   playing 'Jesus, There's Something About That Name' on a piano in his destroyed house was
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.740]   shared by many people following the tornado outbreak of December 10 and 11, 2021."
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:51.060]   I haven't seen that video, but I can imagine what it is, because it's the kind of situation
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.820]   that so many of us have been in or are in, right?
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:59.700]   We're in a situation where everything is hopeless, and if you're a Christian, right, you fall
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.940]   on your knees and you say, "Lord, help me."
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:08.000]   And music is often a way of communing in your spirit with God, and it allows you to express
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.360]   something that you often don't know another way to express.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.880]   And so a song is a powerful thing.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.840]   And you know, Gaither, again, I don't know Gaither, he doesn't know me, but when you
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:27.380]   recognize, right, and you imagine, you know, last summer I was together with all my family
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.640]   members, and when my family members get together, we get together and often we sing.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.320]   Growing up, my dad doesn't play any instruments, but he sings, my mom would play the piano,
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:43.000]   but then all my siblings and I all learn some kind of instrument.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.880]   And so frequently we would get together and we would have family song night at our house.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.480]   And so over the years we've sung together a lot.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.380]   So now we're a little bit more dispersed when we get together, we still enjoy singing together.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.760]   And it's something that blesses my parents, it blesses us, and it's part of our family
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.360]   culture that I really like and admire.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.880]   And so we were together and we sang Jesus, Jesus, or something about that name, it's
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.720]   a classic Christian song that we sang when we were children.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.240]   And my sister actually asked and said, "Do you guys all sing that to your children?
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.000]   All of us sing it to our children."
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.680]   And so I think about that testimony multiplied by about a bazillion times with many, many
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.760]   other people, that's something to be proud of, right?
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   When you're 86 years old and you think, "I was able to create something that helped people.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   I was able to create something that served people.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.960]   I was able to create something that created times of closeness with parents and children.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:44.520]   I created something that was pure, that was good, that was powerful."
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.440]   And a song is one of those things that can leave a legacy.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.360]   And then when there's a story with that song, it goes so far, right?
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:44:01.440]   Here I, like one of my favorite of, I met, there's one of my favorite singers is a man
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.600]   named Wently Phipps.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.480]   And I met him, quote unquote, through finding him on the Gay Through YouTube channel.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.440]   And Wently Phipps does this amazing version of Amazing Grace.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.640]   And the reason it's amazing is because he tells the story of Amazing Grace and how the
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.840]   words and the tune were created.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.400]   And Eric Carnegie Hall and Wently Phipps is singing the song.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.920]   And he's just an amazing guy, big, huge black guy.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.160]   He's got this wonderful voice.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.560]   And he's telling the story of the origin of the song.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.960]   If you're unfamiliar with the song, the well-known Christian hymn, Amazing Grace, it was penned,
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:46.320]   the words were penned by John Newton, who was in, early in his life, was a slave trader.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.040]   And so he was a captain of a slave ship, bringing slaves from West Africa to the United States
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   until he was born again.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:00.520]   And then he renounced that and he became very active in working to abolish the slave trade.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.040]   But the, I shouldn't ruin it for you, I should list the video.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.280]   In fact, I will list the video and you can go and watch it.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:12.840]   But the, no one knows where the tune of Amazing Grace comes from.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.040]   And Phipps performs it in his version of where the tune comes from.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.120]   I won't spoil it for you.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.680]   But it's just the most touching thing.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:26.520]   And so you think about a song like Amazing Grace, that was the work of one man's hand.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   Sat down and wrote a poem and created a song that is now known as the quintessential Christian
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   song.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.320]   It's the song that everybody knows.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:44.200]   And there have been times, I remember when my grandmother was in the hospital, she was
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.480]   in, and we went in and we would go in and sing to her.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.280]   And we would go and sing to her in the hospital and we'd sing loud for the people around to
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.040]   be able to enjoy as well.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.480]   And there'd be all these old people that come up and just say, it touched my heart, right,
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.040]   to listen to that song.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:05.080]   So the point here is that if you can create some kind of work that might have some enduring
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   value, I think that can provide you with tremendous satisfaction.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:15.880]   Whether it's to create a sculpture or to influence an industry or to just simply love the people
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.680]   who are unloved.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.520]   Whatever it is, having that sense of purpose in your work and having something that goes
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:31.280]   beyond the money, beyond the time to a sense of impact is, I think, important for you.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.160]   I don't think you should be under any illusion that anyone's really going to remember your
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   name.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.640]   They're not, right?
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   We're not.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.800]   Once we're dead, maybe our family members will remember our name for a generation or
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.280]   two, but they're not going to remember your name.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.680]   But it's for you to know that something that you've created has impacted and helped other
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.760]   people is, I think, a wonderful thing.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.480]   And when I think about Bill Gaither and his wife Gloria writing those songs and creating
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:05.520]   them and performing them, it's just, to me, a powerful expression of how you can do work
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.400]   that matters.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:12.440]   Speaking of Bill and Gloria, I think another thing that I admire about Bill is that, to
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.160]   my knowledge, he's lived a straight life.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.000]   A good Christian man with a clear testimony.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.280]   In fact, I wanted to make sure I went and did a web search and I searched for "Bill
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.280]   Gaither scandal."
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:31.880]   There was one article that popped up that was written from a hyper-Puritan Christian
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:39.720]   guy talking about how Bill Gaither has sacrificed and been too ecumenical in his work.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   Which whatever.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.240]   But the point is that I couldn't find any, there was nothing about any scandal in his
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.240]   life.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.160]   And I think that's also something that's really important.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.480]   He and Gloria have been married for a very long time.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.120]   Evidently, they have three grown children.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.800]   I know nothing about the testimony of his children, but when you look at and you reflect
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.320]   on that, I think you see that even in Bill's face, right?
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.100]   Or in Gloria's face.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.080]   They have a sense of settledness in their life, right?
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:18.200]   The healthiest lifestyle you can possibly have is simply good, upright, Christian living.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.160]   It removes so much stress from your life.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   It removes so much pain from your life.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:29.080]   Here I was thinking of, I was watching Will Smith at the, whatever the show was that he
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.720]   decked Chris Rock at.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.120]   And I was just comparing, like, here's Will Smith.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.480]   Here's this guy that has an amazing repertoire of movies that he's done.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.120]   We've all enjoyed so many movies.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.640]   Here's a guy who's got it all, right?
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.760]   Who has, who's got it all, right?
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.640]   From an outside perspective.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.120]   And yet, look at his son, look at his wife, look at his marriage relationship, and his
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.080]   life is in shambles.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:01.540]   It's an absolute shambles to the point where he, as a, what, 60-year-old man, something
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.680]   like that?
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.880]   He walks up on stage at an award show and clocks a guy in the face.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:16.240]   It just expresses a fundamental cry for help.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:25.080]   And so I compare Bill Gaither, who of course has not even a fraction of the wealth that
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:31.440]   Will Smith has, not a fraction of the notoriety and fame that Will Smith has, and yet the
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.120]   difference in lifestyle is night and day.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.480]   And there are plenty of actors in Hollywood who have very big names who you can admire.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:46.600]   But having a spouse by your side and having that marriage relationship over decades and
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:55.080]   loving each other and growing old together, having no scandal, no infidelity, no anything,
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.920]   then that's something to be proud of.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.240]   Which brings me to the next thing that I admire.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.280]   I admire that Bill and Gloria have been able to work together over the years.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:10.880]   Gloria, again, is a remarkable musician and she's such a great songwriter.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:16.040]   She has this amazing repertoire of songs that she has written for other people.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.640]   And they've worked together for years.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.360]   They don't always perform together.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.200]   Most of the time she doesn't perform on the road.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:29.320]   And so I have the impression that she doesn't go on the road for months and months like
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.460]   Bill does.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.880]   But they always perform together at some of the special events, right?
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.960]   They host their events together.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:41.200]   And I think that's another thing that's really wonderful to aspire to is can you have
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:47.080]   something where you can be together with your spouse and have some expression where both
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:54.880]   of you can shine in different ways and yet those ways be compatible, collaborative, where
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.880]   they're productive.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:01.520]   You're not competing with one another, not trying to one-up one another, but where you
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:07.640]   can have unique roles and yet have the opportunity to work together and appreciate the good things
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.000]   and the hard times that come from a business.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.280]   I don't know that's always the best, but I admire it when I see that.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.960]   And when I see it in Bill and Gloria Gaither, it really is just something that I take note
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.560]   of and I say, "That's really wonderful.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.600]   I'd like to have that as the years go by.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.680]   I'd like to have some kind of business where my spouse is not separate, where it's not
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.320]   something where it's just my thing, but rather something where we're in it together."
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.720]   And again, that looks different in different relationships depending on what the business
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.520]   is, what the skills of the people are.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.840]   But when I see it, I admire it.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.440]   In conclusion, when I think about all these things that I have said and you basically
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:57.360]   put the whole package together, it gives me some things to which I aspire.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.320]   I don't know how necessarily I'm going to achieve them all.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   I may not.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.160]   The point is that these are things that I think are worth thinking about and worth aspiring
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.560]   to.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:17.120]   And when I compare that against that 18-year-old's post on Reddit about how can I be financially
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:24.120]   independent and quit my work quicker, I want to cry out to the 18-year-old and say, "Take
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.840]   the money you have right now and just find a different job, find a different career."
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:37.280]   Because if you're in a situation like Bill Gaither, why would you retire?
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.180]   Why would you quit?
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:45.200]   Why would you not want to keep doing something that you're skilled at, that people love and
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.440]   appreciate, people pay you money because they want you to do it?
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.320]   Why would you do it?
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.840]   So that you could have more free time?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:53:02.360]   Well, that makes sense if you're working 80 hours a week at a dead-end job that has no
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.480]   personal rewards and you get two weeks of paid vacation a year.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.680]   Well, yeah, I get it then.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:14.000]   But you can develop something where you work three months on, two months off, or where
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.160]   you do some kind of seasonality to your work, to your lifestyle.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.280]   Now it changes things.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:26.440]   And I think that it provides kind of the perfect antidote to boredom.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.280]   You go to work so that you escape from the boredom of not working.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:38.440]   You go to work, you experience the stress, you experience the invigoration of working,
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:43.360]   of providing something, of solving those things, of doing something that you're good at, and
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.920]   then you have your times of rest, times of relaxation.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.040]   Then you go back to work, etc.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.720]   And then you have the opportunity to build something that can last.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.200]   And then when you're working in an area where you're genuinely skilled, an area of core
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:00.960]   genius, then you can make a contribution to the world.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:06.620]   And I, for one, am thrilled that Bill Gaither didn't quit his work 30 years ago.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:10.600]   If he had quit, you know, he made some money performing and decided, "Okay, I'm financially
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   independent and stop singing," I couldn't introduce my children to his music, to his
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.080]   band, to the performers.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.080]   And it was a joy to me.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   I played this Easter playlist to my children, and it was a joy to me to introduce them to
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:34.720]   that and give them really good music with really great performers that they can enjoy.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.640]   And when you think about that, it's like, "Why wouldn't you want that?"
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.000]   I have other heroes, right?
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Clint Eastwood.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.480]   I probably won't do a standalone show on it.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:51.240]   But Clint Eastwood, I could have done this whole show about Clint Eastwood.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.680]   Would you really have wanted Clint Eastwood to quit working 30 years ago because he was
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.080]   rich?
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:04.720]   Think about all the incredible movies that we wouldn't have if Eastwood had hung up his
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.120]   spurs 30 years ago when he was rich enough to retire.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.560]   Can you imagine Clint Eastwood retiring?
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.840]   Why would you want him to retire?
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.800]   The only reason you would want him to retire is if he couldn't do the work.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   Here I think of Bruce Willis recently announced his retirement because he's experienced a
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.480]   degenerative condition that is causing him to not be able to do his work with his normal
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.040]   level of excellence.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.080]   That's understandable, and I think retiring is the right move in that situation.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.440]   But if you can avoid that, you want to avoid it.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.440]   And if you can't avoid it, then you want to keep working.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:51.000]   I hope that Eastwood makes movies for another 20 years, and I hope that he dies literally
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   on set.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.480]   Wouldn't that be a great way to go?
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.360]   Find your own heroes.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.060]   Find heroes that you admire.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.680]   Find things that you admire about them.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:13.120]   And then think creatively of how you may be able to put some of that into your own life.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:19.280]   I said in conclusion, I'm always nervous to say that, let me make one more point.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.360]   Even if you don't know how to achieve it, having an aspiration of something that you
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.240]   admire, something you think would be cool to achieve is enough.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:38.680]   Because you don't need to know how to achieve something in order for it to start working
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.640]   its magic.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:47.000]   Your brain is a computer, and it will notice what you tell it to notice.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.520]   The fact that you've listened now to me expound on one particular man's career, talk about
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   the things that I admire about him.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.120]   Tomorrow, when you see someone else, you're going to notice some of those things that
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.840]   you admire, or you're going to notice the exact opposite of them.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.960]   Your brain is clued into them.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.560]   And so if you just simply recognize, you know what, those are some things that I also admire.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:13.760]   I'd like to be like Clint Eastwood, or I'd like to be like Bill Gaither, or I'd like
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:19.400]   to be like Tom Brady, or I'd like to be like whomever.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:25.100]   Then you'll start to see over the years the moves you can make.
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.960]   It may have been my comments on becoming an elder statesman.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:33.800]   You may recognize, you know what, my voice is probably not, at 86, my voice may not fill
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.660]   the seats.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:39.800]   So how can I become a mentor, and how can I figure out how to use what I do have?
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.520]   Gaither had a platform, had a name.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:48.880]   How can I attract really high quality musicians and bring them together, knowing that I can
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:55.480]   launch their careers, and they'll be better off being with me, even if it's for a time.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.720]   We'll do great work together, and then they'll go on their way.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.160]   There's some version of that in your career, in my career, for all of us to pay attention
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   to.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.560]   So I hope that these ideas have been helpful to you, and I hope that you'll be able to
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.800]   consider them and think of how you can apply them in the days to come.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.520]   If you want to get rich, one of the best ways you can do that is never retire.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.360]   And I'm not joking.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:25.280]   If you want to get rich, one of the best ways you can do that is never retire.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:31.640]   Keep working, and pay off your debts, save some money, pay for your kids' expenses, etc.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.200]   And then keep working.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:40.520]   And you can get very, very rich just simply by keeping working.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.720]   But I think more importantly, if you can build a career that you don't want to retire from,
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:51.080]   then you can live rich and still enjoy your financial freedom at every step along the
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   way.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:58.360]   As we go, I want to remind you that I have a brand new course written four times like
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.360]   these.
