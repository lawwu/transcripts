[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.680]   the host of the Survival Podcast. Jack, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.560]   Hey Joshua, man. Thanks for having me on today.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.480]   I've invited you on today because you have recently been talking extensively about your
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.000]   experience with weight loss on specifically the ketogenic diet. And as with many things,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.920]   I consider you a polymath and I find that you do a really good job of digging into subjects and
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   talking about it. And when it comes to finance and wealth building, back when I was a financial
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.960]   advisor, one of the things that really annoyed me was how myopic the financial advice industry is,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.600]   basically focused specifically on financial products and of course, usually the financial
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160]   products that can be sold most easily. Where when I looked around and I looked at the things that
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.280]   had an impact on the quality of people's lives, I found that things like food and eating and
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.440]   exercise and the kind of work that you did had a far bigger impact on people's lives than the
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.840]   specific financial products that they owned. So you've been doing a series recently and talking
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.120]   a lot about your weight loss journey. Share with us a little bit about your journey,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.880]   specifically in your recent weight loss. Sure. So I have always been an advocate
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.560]   toward eating really healthy food and also toward sticking toward the low carb side of things. And
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400]   what I'll start out with, I'm not saying that the way that I'm eating now and the way I'm
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.000]   suggesting people consider is the best diet for everyone. I do think it might be the best diet for
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.200]   the most people. So I just kind of want to clear the air with that. But there is, all of us,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.360]   especially those of us that teach, we tend to, you can only do so many things. And even when you know
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   what you should be doing, sometimes you're not. And that's been really me with my overall diet
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.600]   for the past couple of years. I have been eating not completely horribly, but not right. And I have
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.480]   also was probably drinking too much as well. And a lot of hard fought weight loss that I had
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.880]   achieved in the past, I had gained back, I was up to about 250 pounds. And that's heavy. It's not
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.640]   hugely heavy for me, I guess, because I'm a big guy overall, but I mean, it's way overweight.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   And so when I decided I needed to fix this, I immediately headed right back to kind of my
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.080]   comfort zone of low carb. A lot of people have told me about keto. And I always kind of, you
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.120]   know, believe that you should investigate things before you write them off. And I kind of written
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.480]   it off without investigating it. As I started to investigate it, it answered a lot of questions
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.560]   for me about my past successes and kind of rollercoastering with low carb, and realizing that
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:03.920]   when you go low carb, you focus on eliminating carbohydrates, obviously. Well, if you don't
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.320]   specifically control then your ratios of fat and protein, then it's all over the map where you
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.600]   might be. So you might be really high in protein for a while as you kind of go one way and you can
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.560]   have some issues there. It's not as easy to maintain a diet when you're high protein, low
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.960]   carb. But when you go to high fat, low carb, it actually gets really easy. A lot of things start
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   to make sense. And I thought, well, you know, why not give this a go. So about 80 days ago,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.320]   I entered into that journey at about 250 pounds. Today, I weighed in at about 212.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.440]   So that is a significant weight loss. The more interesting thing, though, is how I feel and how
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.560]   I look. I recently had someone tell me on these YouTube videos that I've been doing on this that
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.760]   Jack, you look younger than your profile picture on Facebook. I was like, wow, that's interesting,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.120]   because that picture is 10 years old. And I'm almost 50 now. So I mean, that kind of a change
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.960]   is dramatic. And there's a tremendous amount of science behind this. What I found interesting as
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.520]   I started digging into this is the lack of science for the way that they tell everybody that they're
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.320]   supposed to eat. So of course, we all know we're supposed to follow the food pyramid. Now it's a
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.000]   plate. They spent $9 million to turn it from a triangle into a circle of taxpayer money.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.520]   But either way, we're supposed to eat mostly grains. And then we're supposed to eat mostly
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.320]   fruits and vegetables. And of course, they call things like a potato and a french fry a vegetable.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.720]   So what that means is our diets are supposed to be based on sugar. That's the advice that
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.920]   the government's giving us. And it's what they've been giving us in earnest since the 70s. And
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.320]   thanks to the work of a dude named Ansel Keys, who was an advisor to the doctor that took care
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.840]   of Dwight Eisenhower, who brought us all of this mayhem. And it sounds like it makes sense when
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.720]   you just listen to it, because we've been programmed to believe this our whole lives.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.080]   And obviously, grains are healthy. But grains are sugar. And what's happened since we've made this
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.960]   dietary shift in the United States, and it's absolutely been made worse by things like high
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.360]   fructose corn syrup and all that. But what's happened, and you can look at a parabolic curve
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.240]   of this, is the very thing that they said that they were trying to fight by putting us on this
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   diet, which is heart disease, has gone parabolic and increased. And along with it, a thing called
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.240]   metabolic syndrome. And along with that, and parcel to that, type 2 diabetes. So the point
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.000]   where we're at right now, Joshua, where the single largest expense in the healthcare industry within
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.240]   10 years will be complications of type 2 diabetes. In fact, if things stay the way they are within 10
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.080]   to 15 years, there might not be any money in the healthcare system for anything but
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.240]   treating type 2 diabetes. And I was, when I had all my lab numbers done right before I started
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.960]   this, because I didn't want to just be a case for weight loss, I wanted to be able to say, here's
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.440]   also like your A1C, your blood sugar, etc. I was listed as full-blown metabolic syndrome.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.520]   And somehow, somehow, and I believe it's because I was already doing the diet for a week
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.640]   before I actually was tested, I was a borderline type 2 diabetic, wasn't considered quite type 2
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.360]   diabetic. Everything in my life has gotten better since I've done this. And I've realized that
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.800]   coupling it with growing your own food, eating pastured meat, etc., what we're really doing
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.040]   with ketogenics is we're eating the way that our ancestors ate, not for 100,000 years, for 100,000
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.600]   generations. Anybody that tells you that you can go out and live in the wild and live on a plant
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.320]   based diet in the wild, other than a very narrow band of the tropics, has never tried it.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   If you go try it, you're going to find out without modern agriculture, which is at best,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.200]   and not all over the world, at best anywhere in the world, 10,000 years old, without that,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.720]   there is no diet that sustains human life on this planet that is not killing things and eating those
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.560]   things. And when we do that in our natural state, if you think about it this way, I don't know if
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.000]   you hunt at all, if you've ever hunted, but if you kill a deer, what we do today, we gut that deer
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.920]   and we throw away the entrails. Well, if you're trying to survive as an early human, you don't
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.760]   throw away anything. Well, the first thing that's going to go bad on that deer is the organs, the
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.280]   liver, the kidneys, the spleen, etc. So those are actually extremely, when we think of game being
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.920]   lean, they're extremely high in fat. So if we look at the way our ancestors ate, they ate a very high
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:49.840]   fat for what we think of as high fat today, diet. And if we look at that profile, it's about 70 to
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.320]   80% of your calories from fat. That's not total volume of food. Like if you actually look at a
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.360]   plate of my food, when you look at what's on the plate, there's more plant matter on there than
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.960]   animal matter, right? I eat a lot of leafy green vegetables, etc. But the caloric yield is about 70%
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.600]   to 80% fat. And then about only 20 grams of carbohydrate, that's going to be less than 5%.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.760]   And then the balance coming from protein and protein at that quantity is mostly structural,
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.880]   meaning that our body can break down protein and turn it into sugar and use it for energy.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.520]   But it will only do that if it's if it needs to do that, because it's a very energy intensive
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.440]   process to do that. It's only about a 60% yield. So the first thing your body wants to do with
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.520]   protein is it wants to make new muscle, new skin cells, etc, new connective tissue, etc. So that
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:44.240]   protein is first a structural macronutrient, and then second a nutritional one. So by doing that,
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.640]   what we do is we drop our blood sugar through the floor, we bring insulin into balance. And
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.960]   once you do that, weight begins to self correct. Because here's my question for you. Can you name
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:06.320]   an animal in the world that requires caloric moderation to stay healthy, unless we put it in
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.640]   a zoo? That's a that's a excellent, an excellent analogy, because certainly not. There is not,
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   right? There's nothing, there's no animal anywhere on the planet that has to count calories, until we
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:26.880]   alter its natural diet. So why would human beings be the only creature on planet Earth that have to
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.360]   moderate calories? I'm not saying calories don't matter. What I'm saying is when we eat the right
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.680]   way, our bodies largely will self moderate. Now what I had to learn about this, and this is part
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.600]   of my roller coaster is when you are obese, and you have been eating the wrong way a long time,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.120]   you've been shocking your body with sugar for a long time, even health, I don't care if it's,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.640]   I don't care if it's honey, the healthiest sugar in the world, you've been doing that a long time,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:55.040]   you're basically a carbohydrate addict, and you're a food addict. And so when you make this shift,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   you do have to look at calories. That's one of the things I always bought into that lie in the
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.440]   past, when a lot of people say calories don't matter. They absolutely do matter. But once you
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.440]   get your body rebalanced, you know, unless you have like a few days where you get a little insane,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.360]   and you have to start tracking again, you really can let go of that. Because we self moderate the
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.080]   way every other living creature does, when we eat the food we're designed to eat. If you look at a
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.880]   zoo, they have these animals that have diabetes, they have heart disease, they have dental problems,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.480]   all these things that animals have in zoos, you go look at the same species in nature,
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.680]   they don't have any problems. The only real difference is the diet. Or think about this,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.960]   Josh, you look at, you take two kids, eight year old boy, eight year old girl about the same height,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.400]   and I put them facing away from you, and all you see is the silhouette. You can't see anything but
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.880]   a silhouette, no hairstyles, no nothing. You can't tell me which one the boy and the girl is at that
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.840]   age. Assuming they're about the same weight, you can't tell, right? Okay, so now let's move them
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.960]   on to about 18, they have the exact same diet, they're about the same weight, and I show you the
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   silhouette of those two individuals, you can tell me the boy from the girl like that. It's easy.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:12.000]   Because she's curvier, she has fat on her hips, they're eating the same food. What told her body
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.560]   to put that fat on her hips, to retain that extra weight there? Because it's fat that makes the body
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.000]   look different on a female from a male, they retain more fat. Hormones did it. Hormones did it.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.080]   So if we get our hormones right, and we eat right, our bodies largely, not 100%, largely self-moderate.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.720]   - So the thing that's interesting, and I'll share about two minutes of just my experience over the
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:44.880]   last 20 years, I have been overweight/obese pretty much my entire life. When I was in high school,
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   I was overweight, and I used the Atkins diet, lost about 60 pounds when I was in high school,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.440]   which made a big difference for me. But then over the years, my weight increased. I had relatively
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   poor eating habits in college, for a brief time. But for the vast majority of my childhood, my mom
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.120]   has always made, cooked from scratch, made just standard but healthy meals. We didn't eat Oreos,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.240]   we didn't eat junk, we didn't eat pizza all the time. She always cooked from scratch. But in
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:19.200]   college, my body weight increased about 300 to 320 pounds. And basically since college,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:25.840]   up until now, I'm 34 years old, my body weight has always been between 300 and 320 pounds,
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:32.480]   almost no matter how I have eaten. Sometimes I've gone on diets, done this, done that,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   gotten it down, got down to 270, back up to 320. And the thing that has been the most frustrating
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:45.760]   to me about that experience has been observing the quality of my diet accurately with a food
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.000]   notebook and a journal, et cetera, and looking at it and saying, "I don't eat in a way that
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.280]   should cause me to be as fat as I am. I don't eat at McDonald's, I don't eat pizza. I eat,
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.040]   in our household, my wife and I, we cook all our meals from scratch. We don't buy packaged foods.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.840]   We shop around the corner, around the edge of the grocery store. We don't have a lot of sugar,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.000]   a bowl of ice cream three days a week, after dinner kind of thing, but we don't eat a lot
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.240]   of sugar." And it was just so obnoxious to me that I should be so fat. Now, I'm also six and
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.840]   a half feet tall, so most people wouldn't think I'm that obese, but 320 pounds is pretty significant.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.080]   And about eight months ago, sorry, at the beginning of the year in January,
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.760]   I was looking in my mouth one day, and I hadn't been to the dentist in a while, and I was looking
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:41.920]   in my mouth one day, and I look, and I said, "I can see cavities in my teeth." And that just
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.960]   about destroyed me. It angered me deeply, because you should not be able to look in your mouth and
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:53.760]   see dental caries, gray cavities in your teeth. And I thought, "This is not right. I brush my
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.560]   teeth twice a day. I floss my teeth. I eat a good diet. Why are my teeth rotting?" And it really
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:05.440]   just bothered me deeply. So we were in the process of moving outside the United States. We were
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.400]   having babies and whatnot. But anyway, about six months ago, I said, "That's it." And so I went
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.840]   through the whole process, and I researched, and I thought, and I said, "I'm going to go ahead,
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.120]   and I'm going to change the way I eat, and I'm going to change the way I eat, and if I got to
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.040]   do it forever, that's what I do." So six months ago, I started with the ketogenic diet. It seemed
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.720]   like that obviously seemed to have the most stick-to-itiveness of people, seemed to have
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.680]   tremendous results. I was satisfied, based on my previous good experience with low-carb, I was
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.520]   satisfied that it was doable. And with all of the advancements and innovations with ketogenic foods,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.480]   just the different kinds of almond flour and things like that, it can make some treats. I said,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.520]   "You know, I can do this." I don't know if it was age, but I came to a point of commitment,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.400]   and committed, and I did that. Then at the end of August, somebody said, "Have you heard of the
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.160]   carnivore diet?" And I'd never heard of it. I had no idea about it. So it sounded nuts, carnivore
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:08.240]   diet, eating only meat, sounded insane. So I started looking at it, and I was stunned to hear
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.480]   all of the stories that people were having on the carnivore diet, especially of improvements in
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:20.000]   mental health. And some of the people, just the stories that people were having were incredible.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.520]   And so I have my entire life been a vegetable eater. We eat vegetables multiple times per day.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.400]   My kids will eat plates and plates of vegetables. We've always done that.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   But starting on September 1st, I decided to do a three-month trial
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.680]   personally of the carnivore diet. So since September 1st, to our recording this on November
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   1st, I've eaten exclusively meat for the last two months, one more month of my experiment.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.200]   And along the way, I've lost, I've gone from probably, I didn't get exact scale at the
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:00.480]   beginning of about 320 pounds to as of now, 255 in the last six months. And it's been a great
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:08.640]   journey. And it's really, I guess, it's been obviously very gratifying to lose weight,
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.960]   it's gratifying to lose six inches on your belt, et cetera. And especially for men,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.160]   it's been gratifying to do it without having to suffer, which in so many diets that you do,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.200]   you about want to kill yourself because you're in constant deprivation with ketogenic or with
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.680]   carnivore or some version of that. There's so much satiety in the food that you eat that it's
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.120]   really doable. So that's a little bit of my background of where I'm coming from, where I
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.800]   thought it would be an interesting conversation. But here's the point that I want to home in on
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   though, Jeff. I don't have the impression, when you say you probably weren't eating well, yeah,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.280]   you're probably drinking extra calories, but you're so intent on growing your own food,
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.480]   growing your own animals. I have the impression that you weren't eating a standard American diet
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.960]   with Twinkies and McDonald's all the time. You were eating quality food and yet you were still fat,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.160]   just like I was. Is that a true impression? Certainly to a degree. I mean, I have grandkids
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.360]   in the house all the time now, so my wife buys them crap they shouldn't be eating. So occasionally,
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.200]   get in the Cheetos or something. But not to the level that the average person
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.600]   is in America today. It's probably why I weighed 250 pounds instead of 300.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.720]   And I have been 300 pounds in my life. Not quite, but I mean, within a pound or two.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.920]   It's probably what kept me from going back up. There was the quality of the majority of the
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.320]   food I was eating. I was certainly drinking too much alcohol. That is something that
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:35.520]   I've learned. You can use alcohol responsibly, but if you want to lose weight, you got to cut
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:42.560]   out the booze. I mean, to having maybe a drink or two once a week. And then know on that day,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:50.160]   you are not going to be burning fat. You have to have your liver functioning optimally for these
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.360]   diets to really, really work. And I know there's people that they drink through it and they lose
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   weight. Okay. Yeah, you might, maybe, but if you're stuck, you really need to stop.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   And so that's a big part of it. Now, I wanted to back up a little bit too, though. You mentioned
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:12.480]   carnivore and you mentioned bringing the fats in and things like that. My belief is what actually
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:20.000]   is the magic of going with a keto or at least keto-esque or keto-light diet is the fat. The
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.600]   fat is what makes the diet sustainable. You mentioned Atkins. I came on this a little later
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   than the Atkins craze in the middle of what the protein power craze, which was a slightly improved
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:41.120]   version of the Atkins diet by Dr. Michael and Mary Dan Eads. And they made a lot of sense,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.920]   but they were very big on your protein requirement. And this is where I found the
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.720]   argument being made against keto today by so many people and carnivores being a subset of keto
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.640]   is that it's not sustainable. And the thing is that these people are talking about information
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.480]   that's 30 and 40 years old. That's how old that information is. That's how old that style,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.120]   that high protein diet is. A high protein diet is actually very difficult to sustain.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.000]   And one of the reasons is if you go out in nature and I don't care whether you eat,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.960]   like if you're in the tropics, you can find fruit and all. Or if you're in a Nordic country and you
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:26.240]   have to live on reindeer, right? You can't find a natural diet with protein that goes over about 30
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.840]   to 40% in it. If you're actually getting it from nature and you're eating it from nature,
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.640]   what you're going to find is you're going to either get majority of your calories from fat
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.720]   or you're going to get your majority of calories from carbohydrate, which I don't care what anybody
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.640]   says, it's all sugar. And so the other thing that doesn't exist in nature is those two things being
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:52.560]   high together. If you think about like a person that lives in the tropics and is a forager that
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.040]   lives off of fruits and nuts or whatever, okay, they're going to have a diet that's relatively
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.680]   high in carbohydrate, but it's going to be relatively low in fat. If you look at somebody
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.720]   in a Nordic country that's living off of moose and reindeer or whatever, they're going to have
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.680]   a diet that's very high in fat and very low in carbohydrate. So when we look at ketogenics,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.240]   we're actually mimicking the natural diet. And it's that fat though that changes everything.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:25.040]   Because when you eat a high amount of fat, and again, this is a relative number, in the absence,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.080]   and that's what's so important, in the absence of carbohydrate, it is very self-limiting.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:37.200]   You can give a person a loaf of bread and a stick of butter, and they can and often will
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.240]   eat the entire thing, especially like a good fresh warm bread, good creamy butter.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.120]   You give them either of those things independently, and they will stop eating relatively quick. I
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.560]   don't know if you ever tried to, I'm not going to do it, but I could just imagine trying to eat a
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:56.880]   stick of butter with a spoon. That does not, but you wrap it in bread. But if you're sitting there
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.760]   eating dry bread, it's also self-limiting. When those two things come together, for a very good
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.960]   evolutionary reason, it triggers a response where we can eat way more food than we want to. And it
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.800]   goes back to hormones, in this case, leptin. And leptin is the hormone that says, "Yo, dude,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.120]   you're done. Stop. We're good. We got enough energy. We've got enough food. You need to quit
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.040]   eating." The very rare times where you get high amounts of fat and carbohydrate available
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:31.440]   together, or even just high amounts of carbohydrate available in nature, are these big booms in fruit
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.880]   production or something. They're very seasonal. And as a hunter-gatherer, it makes sense that you
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.840]   would want to put a lot of fat on. So the human body has been conditioned. When you have all this
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:47.440]   sugar, shut the leptin down and eat, eat, eat, eat, because we need to eat because winter's coming.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.000]   And until a few hundred years ago, you couldn't just run down to an Albertsons and buy more food.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.560]   So it was necessary for us to be able to do that. And this is why, have you ever had this
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.760]   experience, Josh? You have a meal, you're full. You even look at your plate and there's a little
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:07.040]   bite left and you're like, "No, I'm done." And somebody brings out the dessert cart and you're
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:13.120]   like, "Well, a little bit of cheesecake. That wouldn't be bad." And then all of a sudden,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.680]   you can eat a whole piece of cheesecake. You couldn't eat one more bite of your steak,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.760]   but you can eat because we have this hardwired into us.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.120]   Now that you were asking about the quality of my food, the quality of my food is exceptional,
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:32.080]   but it only takes a little bit of the bad stuff to screw everything up. And when you're an addict,
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.000]   and I have to admit that I will always be a carbohydrate addict, just like a person that
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.720]   comes out of like Narcon or Alcoholics Anonymous, like you're always an addict.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:48.640]   You can't screw around with small amounts of drugs and stay clean. And so if you start eating
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.360]   a Cheeto or two, you will eat the bag of Cheetos. And once you mess up the hormone balance,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:03.840]   everything is done. And so I have had to basically purge this and I had to be rigorous. I had to be
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:09.680]   really rigorous. I use a Keto diet app and I track everything that I eat. I am now at this point
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.480]   where I don't necessarily every day track everything I eat anymore. I do keep an eye on
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.800]   my carb limit and what have you. But if I find myself even remotely slipping,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.320]   then I go back to tracking every single calorie, every single thing I eat. And it astounds you
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.280]   how easy it is to overeat even on Keto with processed foods. And I don't mean like highly
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:36.960]   processed. I mean, like if you take meat and turn it into sausage, there's nothing in effect by
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.840]   itself wrong with that. But all of a sudden, you can eat a lot more than if you eat it as a whole
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.000]   food meat, if that makes sense. - I definitely, so one of the questions,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.040]   and I wonder what you think about this. One of the questions that's bothered me
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:56.160]   is why does it seem like some people thrive on one certain kind of diet or at least with regard
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.960]   to weight and some people don't do well? For example, I've traveled extensively in Asia.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.520]   I've seen people that live on rice and yet they're ripped. They got an eight pack right there.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:14.640]   And I don't understand why there's so much diversity in human bodies such that some people
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.440]   do well on one type of diet and some people don't. Do you have any insight on that?
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.080]   - Yeah, I do. I mean, first of all, we have to understand when we look at something like an
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.920]   Asian paradox there that if you go over to Asia today and you travel through the countryside
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:34.000]   where you've got the little farmers living on rice and fish and a traditional Asian style diet,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.960]   yeah, they're relatively healthy and they may kill over of a heart attack at like 91 or something,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:46.240]   but hey, we all got to go sometime. If you go into like Beijing where they're eating our diet,
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.520]   now they have the same problems we do and they're just as fat as we are.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:55.040]   There really isn't a huge difference in our genetics. Now there's an endomorph and an
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.360]   ectomorph like body type and an ectomorph will never be an endomorph. It's just not,
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.800]   and an endomorph can't become an ectomorph. It just, that is your body type. But overall,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.160]   most people I do believe will do really well on a low carbohydrate diet. That doesn't mean that
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:16.320]   it's the only healthy way to eat. So if you look at that rice diet, what aren't they eating?
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.440]   What aren't they eating? They're not eating any processed foods.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.960]   Their dairy is extremely low. Now I don't hate dairy like some in the keto world do,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   but for many there is an inflammatory response to dairy. And if you have an inflammatory response,
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.720]   there go your hormones and there goes everything away. So they're not heavy on dairy. They are
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:45.040]   eating significant amounts of lean proteins and vegetables. They don't eat many other starches
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.680]   other than rice and they don't eat rice in a refined mechanism. In other words, there's not
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.800]   a lot of rice flours and rice cookies and rice cakes and things like that. They're eating rice
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:04.960]   mostly as a whole grain and they never screwed their body up in the first place. So I think one
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.600]   of the places, if you compare it to a drug, there are people that use drugs recreationally and it
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.640]   doesn't screw their life up. I don't recommend you try it, but it does exist, right? There are
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:23.440]   people that yeah, they do their dope and they're good. Once a person creams over the world into
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:30.240]   addiction, they can't use drugs. And at minimum, you'd say you have to take the drugs away for like
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.000]   a year to get them completely clean before they could ever even touch a drug again. And I think a
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.600]   lot of us, the keto diet is a pathway to a paleo diet eventually, if we stay on it long enough,
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.160]   where we bring in some fruits and some other things, a little bit more of that, and maybe
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.360]   don't restrict the carbs down to like 20. Actually, like a 70 carbohydrate a day diet, that
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.560]   sounds huge to me and you now, but that's actually incredibly restrictive compared to the average
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:06.160]   person. And that paleo way of eating may even be a better way of eating, but not necessarily for
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:13.040]   the person that's 300 pounds that has been obese for 20 years. In many ways, keto is a therapeutic
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:19.840]   way of eating. But if you wanted me to make the case that it's impossible to have a diet that is
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:27.680]   more of a grain-based, vegetable-based diet and not have that diet be healthy, I can't make that
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:34.800]   case that it can't be healthy. I just think that as you look at it for most people, it's a hell
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.320]   of a lot easier to do with quality fats and quality proteins. And I will say, I know you
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.760]   have people out there right now screaming at their speaker, "Don't do that, Josh, I can't hear you,"
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.640]   about everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows. Well, here's the thing about everybody
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.360]   knows. Everybody knows it's not a logical argument. It's not a valid argument. It is a
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.920]   classic fallacy known as an appeal to authority. And when people tell you things like fat makes
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:11.840]   you fat or fat causes heart disease, I have issued a challenge now. My podcast, 40,000 YouTube
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.400]   subscribers, I put this out on YouTube as well. I have 100,000 followers on Facebook for my page.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.360]   No one has taken my $100 bill yet. And I'll put it out to your listeners today.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:29.840]   If you can bring me a single scientific study that shows that people who consume large amounts
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:36.640]   of clean fats, animal fats, avocados, et cetera, not trans fats, not vegetable fats that have been
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.880]   cooked like soybean oil, et cetera, good, clean, natural fats, fish oils, et cetera.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:50.560]   And any study that's ever shown that eating that in the absence of carbohydrates increases the risk
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.720]   of heart disease at all, 1%. I will give you a $100 bill signed with my name on it. I've had
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:04.160]   that in place for 90 days. Nobody's gotten my $100 bill yet. And so one of my big concerns for
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.440]   people is this concept of everybody knows. Well, if everybody knows that's true, surely somewhere
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.640]   there's proof of it. If everybody knows something, there has to be proof.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.320]   What do you think somebody could find proof really, really quick if everybody knows this?
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   So I know that you're asking me there more about our different body types.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.360]   I don't think the different body type or the different who thrives on what diet is really
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.880]   that critical. I think people can work that out for themselves, but I have yet to see anybody
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:44.080]   who actually does this diet that doesn't benefit from it. And I've just had 50 people take part
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.480]   in a 40-day challenge. My average weight loss was 14 pounds. And this is all over the map.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.200]   I had people I'm like, "God, you're not going to lose any weight. You're already skinny."
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.560]   And I had people like, "Holy crap, this might save your life." And with all said and done,
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:04.880]   my average weight loss over 40 days is 14 pounds. If there was a pill that did that,
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.760]   the people that held the patent on it would be worth a trillion dollars right now.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:17.600]   When you start digging into the data as best you can, I think Gary Taub's books are accessible for
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.720]   people who are interested in why we get fat and some of his conversations. But when you start
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.760]   digging into it, one of the things that I have learned is the things that everybody knows that's
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.160]   backed up by science, it's kind of embarrassing when you actually look at what is said by the
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:40.000]   scientific research, the evidence behind it, and what conclusions you can actually draw from it.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.480]   One of the things that I think is one of the healthiest solutions, there's an increasing
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.920]   movement of what they're calling the N equals one movement, meaning it doesn't matter what
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.400]   results necessarily you get, what matters is the results that I'm getting, how do I feel.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:00.480]   And I think that there's an increasing number of people like me who I have been mystified and
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.240]   annoyed by the topic of eating well for so long because for every single style of eating, I can
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.560]   find a noted expert who says, "This is the way to go and look, here's my evidence." And I'm not
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.600]   competent to assess their arguments. I don't have the background, I don't have the time,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.720]   I don't have the ability in that field to assess their arguments and know for sure who exactly is
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.560]   right. But I do know how to look at my own body and say, "How do I look? How do I feel?" I do
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.760]   enough, and I don't need a bunch of blood tests necessarily, I can just look and say, "How do I
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:38.000]   look? How do I feel?" and have some good indicators of how I'm responding to a certain style of eating,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.280]   to a certain kind of exercise, etc. And I hope that that N equals one movement continues to grow
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:48.640]   because I think that is what matters. I want to dig into some specific questions.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.320]   >> Let me talk on that for a second, though, because that's an incredibly good point. And
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.360]   there's something happening today that could have happened 30 years ago with that movement.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:03.280]   The individual is now scalable. The same reason that people like you and I can earn a living from
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.960]   home with a podcast. >> Right, absolutely.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:10.400]   >> It's the same reason that this movement is scalable. So what I mean by that is if you go
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.760]   to YouTube and type in "Keto diet success story," you will find not just big-time YouTubers like
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.280]   Ken Berry and Thomas DeLauer, you will find hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.320]   individuals who aren't even really trying to make any kind of money or anything like that.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.680]   They're just really excited, and they're just going to show you, "This is my N plus one.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.360]   This is what it's done for me." And you can look through and see thousands of these people going
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:47.120]   from 300 to 180 pounds over and over and over again. Go look for Jenny Craig success stories
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:55.200]   that aren't by Jenny Craig. Go look for Weight Watchers success stories that aren't by Weight
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:01.520]   Watchers. If you look at those two particular programs, they are the healthy version of the
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.760]   standard American diet, the Jillian Michaels of the world, right? And you don't have an N plus
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:16.800]   one there. And it's not scaling. If it was there, you would see it. I haven't found a Facebook group
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.200]   with a half a million people really excited about Jenny Craig. And I'm going to tell you right now,
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.720]   you're not going to. If you find one for Jillian Michaels, it's a bunch of guys looking at her in
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.600]   yoga pants, but they're not going to be eating the way that she says and posting pictures about how
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:40.000]   healthy they are. This movement is scalable today because the individual can be heard. And I think
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.840]   it's reaching kind of a critical mass. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. So that brings,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.640]   that's a good segue, an ideal segue into my kind of twist. I don't know how much you've followed
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.600]   some of the carnivore world, but I've been fascinated by it. And the thing that fascinated
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:04.560]   me the most, the reason I decided to try and see, try eating the carnivore, full carnivore diet for
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:11.680]   three months was because of all of the experiences that people were sharing of things, of health
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:17.920]   conditions that they had struggled with that were only improved when they literally started eating
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.760]   only meat. The most famous one, that's the best place for anybody who is the most, who's new to
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:30.800]   the idea would be Dr. Jordan Peterson's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. He and also his daughter,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:38.400]   Michaela Peterson, are probably the most popular advocates of eating a diet exclusively of beef
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.000]   and water and salt. Michaela Peterson calls it the lion diet. But they experienced tremendous
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:51.120]   improvements in mental health. Dr. Peterson shared in his appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.960]   how day by day, his lifelong depression, anxiety went away by when he stopped eating greens. He
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.040]   had eaten a low carbohydrate diet for a time, was eating meat and some greens. And finally,
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.080]   his daughter convinced him to stop eating greens and he experienced tremendous improvements in his
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.920]   mental health. So Dr. Jordan Peterson and Michaela are probably the most well-known. But then I went
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.360]   to the internet and I started looking for stories. And I found person after person, after person,
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.200]   after person who said, "I went on the carnivore diet. I started eating only meat and all these
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.760]   physical problems went away." And the thing that most intrigued me was the tremendous improvement
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:34.000]   in mental health. Many people reporting that their depression disappeared. Many people reporting that
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.840]   their anxiety disappeared. And years, chronic, diagnosed depression, tremendous improvements
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:46.720]   there. And I was just so stunned because based upon all of what I believe to be the science of
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.400]   healthy eating, I could never believe that vegetables are causing problems to people.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.520]   But there seems to be at least a small subset of people that vegetables themselves were making them
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:05.040]   sick or keeping them sick. And so I decided to do the carnivore diet. And I don't think I'll stay
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.840]   on it forever. I think I'll go back to eating a keto diet. I put my whole family on a keto diet.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:16.640]   And I don't like always eating my own food. But I will say this, when you compare the experience
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:23.360]   that you have, especially as a man, of the fact that you can eat just simply meat and eggs,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:30.480]   and have eggs and bacon and steak, you feel so satisfied. You don't feel like you're suffering.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.680]   And that helps the ability to stick to a diet. That helps to stay with it. And I can show you
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.560]   example after example after example of people who've been eating a pure carnivore diet for,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.840]   in some cases, almost two decades, and they look younger now than they did when they started. So
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.920]   I don't know if you've ever tried it. But I've been fascinated by my own personal experiment
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.520]   to go all the way to full carnivore and stop eating even vegetables, just to see. So far,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.440]   I haven't noticed that I have any sensitivity or any problems to vegetables, which is why I'll go
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.200]   back probably to eating significant amounts of vegetables. But I recommend it as something to
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   test, to do that N=1 test, because the stories that are available with the ability to access
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:19.680]   individuals— I think it'll be the biggest trend of 2012. Or sorry, 2012. 2020, in my opinion.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.760]   Well, so there's actually a lot to that. And remember, I'm not a doctor. I don't even play
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.320]   one on TV. And I'm certainly not a nutritionist, which means I probably know more about nutrition
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:36.160]   than most nutritionists. But I'm speaking as a layman here and some postulations. So number one,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:43.360]   I've used carnivore whenever I felt stuck. I go four or five days, I'm not losing weight anymore.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.920]   I'll go carnivore for a week. Sometimes that'll unstick you. I don't know whether it unstuck
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:54.800]   because I went carnivore or it just was going to happen anyway. I kind of look at it as I'm not far
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:04.480]   off anyway. But I have done a tremendous amount of research into all of this since I started.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:11.120]   And one of the things that I've learned is that one of the things we're told so much that we need
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:18.640]   to have, maybe we don't for a time, and that is fiber. And we're always told how important fiber
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.720]   is fiber, fiber, fiber. Well, I've now listened to quite a few different doctors coming from
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:28.640]   different viewpoints on this of people that have gut problems. And the first thing they do is cut
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.360]   the fiber out and the gut problems go away. Well, one of the reasons could be that we have so
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:40.880]   screwed up our intestinal flora that we can't properly digest the fiber. And the way we digest
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:46.400]   soluble fiber is through fermentation, but we do it through probiotic fermentation,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:52.880]   lactobacillus and other bacterium like that in our gut. And the actual nutrient we take from the
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:59.920]   fiber is in the form of something called a short chain fatty acid, which is almost, almost its own
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.360]   macro. It's really not a carbohydrate and not a fat at the same time. It's its own unique little
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:12.880]   thing. And that's good for us. That's a good thing. And a lot of the vegetables that make a lot of
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.360]   sense for us to eat, or even some of the tubers that makes us worry if we move toward more of a
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:24.240]   paleo diet, have large amounts of soluble fiber called inulin in it. And that is a primary source
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:30.480]   of these short chain fatty acids. Well, what if your gut flora is screwed because you've lived for
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.760]   20 years weighing over 300 pounds and you haven't actually been taking care of your gut flora and
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.200]   you thought you were going to pop a bunch of probiotic pills that were going to fix that.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.640]   They can't actually fix that because they can't get through your stomach assay to live.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:51.360]   So you have a screwed up gut and you're continuing to eat large amounts of cruciferous vegetables and
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.520]   other vegetables that have a lot of fiber in them. It may not be the vegetables themselves that are
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.920]   the problem, but eliminating the fiber from the intestine so that your intestine can actually heal
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:09.440]   and redevelop its flora for a time where you're not killing it with artificial sweeteners like
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:15.440]   sucrose and additives that are in all of the food that we eat today may be very therapeutic. So that
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:21.920]   could be part of the issue. Then I'm also back to Mark Sesson, who I don't agree with on everything,
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.720]   but I think he's a brilliant man, the primal blueprint guy.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.920]   And he certainly looks like you and I would probably like looking when we're 66.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.360]   Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm like that at 66, I'm good. Right. This is a guy that was on the cover
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.160]   of Runner's World Magazine back in the seventies and he was carb loading and everybody thought he
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.720]   was a picture of health. And he'll tell you in his own interviews, he was ready to, he was,
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.640]   he was killing himself. He looked great, but he was killing himself on carbohydrates.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.440]   Well, he's more of the primal paleo type thing. He's more of, yes, some fruit here and there,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.960]   et cetera. Less of a, certainly not carnivore though. I think he's, he's like, I don't even
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.120]   know if we should count protein calories at all if we're eating enough fat anyway, because we're
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.400]   going to use it from so much for structure. But he was asked by, I don't remember who the interview
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.920]   was about, you know, what about healthy vegans? There are healthy vegans, there are healthy
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.160]   vegetarians. And he went back to the thing I said earlier. What have we, what have we,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.720]   what do we have in common? It's what we've eliminated. So I also think there may be people
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.880]   that do really good on carnivore and they say, well, I was eating keto and I was eating healthy
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:28.320]   keto before I went carnivore. But okay, well, what was going on your salad? What oils were
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.280]   you using on your salad? What, uh, what, what, what, what salad snacks were going in there? What,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:41.840]   what things were you eating that may not have been the best things? How clean was your keto?
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.000]   Because, you know, we have like, we call clean and dirty keto. And I think dirty keto may be as
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.200]   bad or worse as the sad American diet. You may lose some weight, but how clean were you? Well,
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.920]   if you go carnivore and you say, well, when I go carnivore, I'm also going to eat grass fed meat,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.520]   pastured poultry. I'm going to eat, you know, the best quality bacon I can get. If I'm going to eat
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:08.160]   eggs, I'm going to eat, you know, backyard eggs or pastured eggs. Well now by going carnivore,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.320]   you've also gone clean. And I wonder if some of the people that were keto with giant Dr. Evil air
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:21.200]   quotes around it, I was keto, right? Were keto, were actually dirty keto and going carnivore
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.880]   made them clean keto. And then I think there's a subset like Ken Berry, you know, you, I'm sure
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:33.200]   you follow him. You know, when he had his 23andMe DNA done, he was like 98% Nordic DNA.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:40.400]   Well, I think if that's you, you're going to actually probably have some genetic disposition
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.840]   toward carnivore because what the hell are you going to eat in Northern Sweden for nine months
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:50.240]   out of the year? You might find a lingonberry or two here and there, but I mean, you're going to
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.720]   live on reindeer. You're going to live on reindeer, reindeer milk and reindeer fat, because
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.120]   that's what they have there. If you're, if you have Inuit DNA, you're going to live on seal
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:07.680]   blubber because that's what they have there. So I think that there may be people that have a more
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:14.080]   of a predisposition toward carnivore just because of their genetic makeup. I think blood type can
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.200]   be an indicator of this. I'm an, I'm O positive. That's why I always donate blood because I feel
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:25.600]   like I'm obligated to as universal donor. But the reason O positive can go to anybody, it's the
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:32.080]   primal blood. It's the, it's, it's our original hunter gatherer blood is the O blood type and
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:37.600]   specifically O positive. So that's probably why I do, even though I say I'm keto, I'm very
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:44.400]   carnivoresque, right? I might have a big salad, but my big salad is a bunch of leafy greens with
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.400]   meat on it. It's not four pounds of cheese on top of the salad and I call it a salad, right? It's,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.480]   it's meat and greens. And so I think there's the combination of things there, damage to the gut,
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.440]   actually going clean, the things that we have in common and what is your genetic predisposition.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.200]   But I don't know any of that. I want to be very clear. Like a lot of times when I'm talking,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.960]   like everything I said up to that segment was pretty much not my opinion. It was like
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.880]   my opinion of facts, right? This is my opinion of opinions at this point.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:21.520]   - Right. To me, I think going back to N equals one, most of us should simply test different
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:27.200]   things. And I really admire that there are a whole community of people who are ex-vegans,
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.720]   who started testing and saying, how do I feel when I started eating meat again? And they, and they
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.400]   experienced better results. Then of course, there are some people who probably didn't experience
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.760]   those results. And the key is to test. One anecdotal thing that I find really interesting
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:47.600]   on the fiber thing, in my opinion, that's probably the best example to start with to say,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.760]   the things that you think you know, might not actually be true. We've all been told that you
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:57.680]   need fiber, especially to keep your, your regularity with your bowel movement. Anecdotally,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   I haven't had a bit of fiber. I've eaten nothing but meat and eggs for two months. I haven't had
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.960]   a bit of fiber and I have had entirely regular bowel. And in fact, there's an interesting website
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:15.200]   called gutsense.org, where they publish a whole book called the fiber menace. And it's fascinating
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:21.280]   to read these alternative perspectives and say, wait a second, does my Cheerios box telling me
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:27.040]   the truth that I need fiber for heart health, or should I trust and see what my own personal
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.480]   experience is? And I think that's the key because I'm convinced that the-
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.320]   Well, you know, there's, there's another thing there that you're, you're hitting on. So how
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.200]   many people decide they want to go keto and the first thing they want to do is make keto cookies
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:45.840]   and keto bread, right? That's like the keto treats. And I'm like 40 days, just be a damn adult,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.600]   pull up your pants, tighten your belt and no, you get whole foods. It's like whole 30, only it's
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:56.560]   worse. That's what you get for 40 days. And then you can have a keto cookie or something from time
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.720]   to time. You got to, we got to get you through, it's a 12 step process to get the alcoholic,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:06.880]   right? I got to get you to step 10 and then maybe you can have a cookie, right? So how, but nobody
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.240]   wants to hear that. That's uncomfortable and we don't like to be uncomfortable. So they're going
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.720]   to go make keto pancakes and keto flatbreads. So what do they make it out of? How do you make that
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:23.040]   and make it taste like bread? You go and you find something like psyllium husks,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.760]   right? You go find these coconut flour, et cetera, these extremely high fiber
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:36.240]   things because the fiber is indigestible. So now you're slamming your damaged gut
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:44.560]   with a shit ton of indigestible and semi-digestible fiber and boy, you have a problem.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.880]   Well, duh. And I'm not saying that's, I want to be clear what, because the people are going to get
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.400]   mad at me and then they're going to see that I have a low carb tortilla that I make and they're
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.640]   going to get like, the keto police will get me. You said not to eat that, right? So like, I'm not
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.160]   saying not to eat that. I'm saying don't eat that every day, all the time to the exclusion of
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.040]   everything else. If you go to a keto diet and the first thing you're doing is making pizza balls and
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:13.520]   almond bread and coconut tortillas and that's what you're going to base your diet on now. Now you're
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.720]   eating like a stupid amount of fiber and again, this is on Bracto Opinion here. I don't know,
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.000]   but it seems to me that most of us probably don't have the healthiest guts.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.480]   And fiber in an unhealthy gut is probably not a good thing because it's going to feed what's there.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.560]   See, people think, well, it's going to reestablish my gut flora. No, it's going to feed what's there.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:44.080]   So if the biotics in your intestine are the ones that cause irritable bowel syndrome and discomfort
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.040]   and large amounts of gas and you give them fiber, guess what they're going to do? They're going to
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.520]   eat it and they're going to reproduce and they're going to increase in numbers. You almost have to
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.240]   starve them out, which is ironic because that may lead us to talk about cancer here in a minute
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.920]   because that's another huge benefit here. And I know your show's on finance and one of the things
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:10.080]   we got to reinforce all the way through this, all of this puts more money in your pocket by
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:14.000]   preventing money from leaving it. People tell me this is expensive. You know what's expensive?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.280]   Insulin. Insulin's expensive. You know what's expensive? Dialysis. You know what's expensive?
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:25.840]   Chemotherapy. These things are expensive. Heart transplants are expensive. Heart bypasses are
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:32.080]   expensive. Stints are expensive. Statins are expensive. Good food is not expensive compared
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:39.360]   to those things. Right. Yeah, I'll add to that and we'll switch to money in just a moment.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.080]   But a phrase I looked for it, it was attributed to Joel Salatin. I went and looked to see
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:51.600]   if I could find the original source for it. But the quote that was said to me was, you know,
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:57.840]   a hundred years ago, people spent 30% of their budget on food and 5% of their budget on health
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:03.040]   care. Today we spend 5% of our budget on food and 30% on health care. I've never verified those
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.160]   numbers, but I think directionally it's probably, probably. I mean, I can tell you flat out that
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:15.440]   my single largest expense is health insurance. I barely ever go to the doctor. So even if I'm,
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:21.520]   if you're not paying the bill today for direct medical supplies and treatment,
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.520]   you're paying the bill for others. I mean, so yeah, I actually think that number might be low.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.800]   The 30%. I think there's people today that are spending like maybe half of their money
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:40.160]   in total cost on health care. Yeah, absolutely. So I want to give just my tips and then you give
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.720]   your tips for anybody who wants to test or try a transition to a keto diet. And then I want to talk
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.280]   about the money and the food quality, et cetera, because I think with your experience, and also I
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.200]   want to talk about with prepping as well, as we, as we wrap up in a little bit. Number one, my
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:02.480]   advice based upon having dieted in many ways and done many different versions of diets, my advice
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   to anybody who is interested in trying it is the following. Number one, do a little bit of research,
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.000]   obviously, about the keto diet or any diet that you're going to try. But at the end of the day,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.800]   it's fairly simple. You're going to eat meat, vegetables, and you're going to try to eat
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:24.560]   some sources of fat and it's going to be heavy on fat. So you want to understand the ratios as well.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.960]   My experience has been that a keto diet is one of the best diets to transition to
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:36.640]   because of your ability to enjoy luxurious food. And what I have found is that if your body is
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:43.280]   addicted to carbohydrates, as you transition out of running on sugar and your entire metabolism
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:48.800]   going to sugar to running on fat, make sure that you feel satiated. So what I do is I try to make
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.760]   sure I have lots of good food, lots of good steak, lots of good fat, heavy cream with some berries,
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.080]   et cetera. And I don't try to worry about losing weight. I just try to feel really satiated and
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.680]   really full, even if I'm probably overeating. Then once I make the transition from running
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:10.880]   on carbohydrates to actually being in ketosis and burning ketones for fuel, then I can pull back on
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:16.640]   those things without feeling like I'm missing out. One of the great side benefits of a low
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:22.320]   carbohydrate diet is that once you're in ketosis, what I have found is your appetite fairly easily
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:28.480]   moderates. And it makes it fairly easy to practice a compressed eating window or perhaps called
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.040]   intermittent fasting, where you eat instead of eating three times per day or seven small meals
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:40.160]   per day, you eat one or two times per day. And I find that it's very easy to just simply go with,
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.720]   get up in the morning, I drink some black coffee and have my first meal around noon,
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.160]   have my second meal around six o'clock. And that practice in and of itself also moderates the
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.640]   calories. So I think the most important thing is the transition period, making sure that you have
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:00.720]   luxurious food, lots of fat. And then once that transition is done, then you can move to pulling
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:06.000]   off on the calories, et cetera. And it's a lot easier to do. That's my kind of getting started
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.080]   advice. Jack, what's yours? It's going to sound different, but it's very similar actually,
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.800]   because I'm going to focus a little bit more on calories, et cetera. But it's the same thing. It's
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:21.520]   the same, but different man in the words of Tommy Chong, right? So for about a week to 10 days,
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   I say do exactly what you said, which is you keep your carbs under 20 and eat as much as you want.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:36.320]   Eat until somebody's afraid you're going to eat to sink. If that's what you feel like doing,
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.720]   because during this time, you're going to be making your body do exactly what you said.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   You're going to make it shift from burning glucose to burning ketone bodies. And that's a
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.280]   big... You're asking a lot. It's like taking somebody on heroin and going, "No more heroin
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:54:00.480]   for you. Here, you can have all of this oranges. You have to live on oranges instead of heroin."
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.360]   I mean, that's what you're doing to your body. So getting through that, and this is one of the
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:11.760]   my biggest gripes with Atkins. Dr. Atkins didn't tell anybody that about half of the people that
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:18.160]   do this are going to feel like they're having a 10-day version of the worst hangover you can
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.960]   imagine. Now, some people are just going to be like, "Oh, that's fine." Other people, it's going
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.360]   to hit you like a ton of bricks. They call it keto flu. So if you got to eat, consider that your
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:34.480]   methadone, right? For getting off the meth. And you eat through... If it's 10 days, if it's 14
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.240]   days, whatever, and you're going to lose weight in that time. And for some of you that are really
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:43.840]   overweight, you're going to lose a lot of weight because your body's going to purge water. Most
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.160]   people that are extremely overweight, because their stomach, you think it's going to be like
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:52.560]   a bowl full of jelly like Santa Claus. You got that stomach that's really, really hard, that big,
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:58.560]   fat, hard stomach. There's so much fluid and extra bile in the body. And as soon as you change this,
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.480]   you're going to start purging it. Now, what's going to come with that is, number one, you got
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.680]   to drink like a fish and then some. And you got to drink water. And if you want to drink sparkling
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.880]   water or something, that's fine. But don't be drinking huge amounts of artificially sweetened
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.040]   crap. Water and drink and drink. And you're going to pee your brains out. And then you're not going
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.200]   to want to drink because you're going to get to pee again. I'm sorry. You got to get through this
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:28.480]   period of time. So drink like crazy during this time. And you need to be supplementing magnesium
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:34.640]   and sodium. So salt your food is the best way to do the sodium. A good quality absorbable magnesium
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.400]   and potassium doesn't hurt here either as a supplement, because you're going to be purging
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:44.240]   those three minerals from your body with all of this water loss. I work with a guy named Dr. Stephen
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:51.120]   Lewis. And he's at a site called Green Wisdom Health. He uses blood testing. He's a chiropractor,
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   but he uses blood testing. It's way more than my doctor has ever ordered to evaluate your nutrient
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.840]   levels and supplement you. And I didn't do that because I was doing this. They just sort of kind
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:06.400]   of came together. And I think a lot of the things I avoided was because every time I would find out
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.520]   was people were asking me like, "Well, I'm having this problem." I'd go like, "Well, supplement this."
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.840]   And I'd look at my supplements and go, "Well, I'm on that." So it was like everything I needed was
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.120]   already in there. So look to supplements for some of the things that you're going to be deficient in,
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.920]   because now some of them you were already deficient, but you're going to become critically
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:29.360]   obvious. The other thing you have to watch out for is then you start burning this fat. And like you
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:34.880]   said, you've been overweight your whole life. I've been overweight for a lot of my life. So that means
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:40.320]   a fat cell that you're burning today might've been there for 15 years. We store toxins in our fat.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.960]   It was the old thing, it's going to get worse before it gets better. So you start burning
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:51.360]   those fat cells and toxins that have been stored up in your body forever, all of a sudden are
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   moving through your bloodstream to be eliminated. We have to get through that, but it happens.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.680]   It's important that people know this. I started getting zits. I'm almost 50. I started getting
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:05.600]   zits, not like breaking out of my face, like one zit, like at that one spot in your back you can't
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.240]   reach, it was almost like a little boil. And there'd be nothing there. And then the next morning,
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:15.840]   there's a big giant bulbulous zit there, or maybe on my bicep or something. And it would come like
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:21.040]   one at a time. That went on for about three weeks. So expect, some people get a rash. I got a really
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:26.800]   light rash. My wife looked like she had poison ivy. And this is the body purging all those toxins. So
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   I think it's important that we have people ready for that. Because people say, "Well, I went on
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:37.200]   keto and I felt like shit." Well, you know what? Imagine if you were getting off of heroin,
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.480]   and you went to your doctor, you were an alcoholic, and you went to your doctor and
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.640]   you said you felt bad. And he said, "What'd you do?" "I quit drinking beer." And you say, "Well,"
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.120]   he guy says, "Well, how much beer were you drinking?" "I was drinking like a case a day for
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.760]   the past 10 years." He says, "Well, go have a beer. You'll feel better." You get a new doctor.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:58.560]   We have to be prepared for this shift and this change. Once you get through that 10 days though,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.240]   and you get over to where the body is working and running on fat and ketone bodies,
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:08.480]   I think that is the point. Maybe it's 14 days, maybe it's 21 days. Somewhere in that reasonable
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:14.800]   period, you've got to rein in the calories. And I think eventually you will self-moderate like
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.440]   every living being. But so many people say it doesn't work for them. And then I say,
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.800]   "Send me a picture of everything you ate today," and they're eating 7,000 calories.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.720]   They're 300 pounds, they're eating 7,000 calories, one pound of human fat. Do you know how many
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.480]   calories is in one pound of human fat, Josh? Josh McCallen (00:15:00):
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.160]   3,500, right? Dr. Justin Marchegiani (00:15:02):
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:41.120]   3,500 calories. How am I going to get my body to burn 3,500 calories of fat when I'm shocking
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:46.800]   with 4,000 calories a day of additional fat? You might not even stop gaining weight at that point,
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.840]   but it's going to be very hard to lose weight. So pull the calories back. I use an app called
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:59.760]   the Keto Diet App. I run a caloric deficit most of the time of about 15% to 20%. A lot of people
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:05.200]   say calories don't count. It's only an estimate. It is only an estimate, but it's an estimate,
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.600]   right? I do a lot of things with estimates. I used to make a living as an estimator, right?
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:15.680]   So estimates are a valid way. There has to be some level of portion control. So get the portions
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.760]   that are under control and then kind of work your way through it. Don't be afraid to use YouTube
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:27.520]   University. I would tell you also be careful with that. There's some real idiots out there that say
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   some things that don't make any sense. Tom DeLauer, Ken Berry, and this couple called Keto
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:39.760]   Connect. Those three channels to me, and I want to be clear, I can still tell you specific things.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:46.080]   Each of them said, "Bro, you are absolutely verifiably wrong with this claim." But they're
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:53.840]   right 95% of the time. So 95% is a good estimate. If you can estimate at 95%, you could be a hell
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.960]   of a salesman in the construction industry and you'll do very well. So you're 95% of the way
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:05.280]   there most of the time with those guys. So if you check stuff and you're like, "Why do I have this
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.880]   problem?" and you search YouTube for that, and you find one of those three people talking about it,
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:17.440]   you'll probably do really well. I also have a whole playlist and you can just look up "Jack's
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:24.400]   Low Carb Journey" on Google. You'll find a playlist. I go through this whole period and I
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:30.080]   have one particular episode there to make this short, as short as we can. It's exactly how I
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.560]   manage my diet. It's about 30 minutes and it's exactly what I do. So I would tell people to
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.280]   kind of tune into that. Cool. I added it to the notes. Let's talk about money. One of the
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.960]   challenges with personal finance is, in general, one of the standard pieces of advice for those
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.880]   of us who try to save money on our grocery budget is eat less meat, eat more rice and beans. You
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:58.480]   can buy huge amounts of grain extremely inexpensively, whereas finding huge amounts
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.920]   of meat extremely inexpensively is very challenging. So what are your thoughts in
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.320]   terms of managing the cost and having an appropriate budget while also eating in a ketogenic manner?
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:17.040]   So before I say this and sound like a jerk, I'm going to say that there are people out there who
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:23.360]   are really living at the edge financially. And what I'm about to say doesn't pertain to you
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.040]   at all. But for many people, that excuse is total bull because I look at what they're eating
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.640]   and they're spending more money than I do on food in many instances because they're eating so damn
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   much of it. And yet you can eat cheap on rice and beans. It feeds half the world. And if you have
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.440]   to live that way, I'm not going to make your life worse by telling you you're wrong. I'm not going
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.040]   to do that. However, we can eat not just meat, but good quality meat without breaking the bank.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.920]   And we need to be creative about how we shop to do that. But one of the best things you can do
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.680]   is find somebody producing grass fed beef and buy a half or a quarter or even a whole beef and put
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.120]   it in a deep freezer. And as a prepper, people are like, "Well, what do you do then?" I have a
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:12.320]   generator. I have a generator and I have 120 gallons of gasoline. Right? So the last thing
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.640]   I'm worried about when the power goes out is my freezer. I only have to run that sucker a couple
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.160]   hours a day and everything will stay frozen in it. I'm more worried about my fish tanks because I
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.200]   want my fish to die. So we could just solve that straight out of the gate with the number one prep
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.080]   you should have anyway is a good generator. But here's some examples of ways that I've
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:38.640]   reduced the cost of our meat. One is Costco and organic poultry. Now, I would much rather have
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.840]   pastured chicken than just organic chicken. But organic is better than commercial by a long shot.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.680]   If you go to your local Costco and you go into the chicken section, you'll see they have a package
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.880]   of I don't know how many pounds is because it varies by the one, but it's three sections and
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:05.120]   each one has about six chicken legs in it, organic. And that whole thing, which is multiple
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.080]   meals is about nine bucks. Now to me, you can't tell me you ate McDonald's and you ate better
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.680]   for less money than I did if I'm eating that chicken in the hundred different ways that I
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:22.320]   can cook it. You can't just go away. There's no discussion to be had there. You drop five bucks
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:28.080]   at McDonald's. I drop nine bucks on three meals of chicken for two people. We're done on that money
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:35.360]   discussion. Next is with beef. Grass-fed beef is very expensive when you buy it from the grocery
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.960]   store, unless it's ground. Ground beef sells for about seven bucks a pound at Albertsons,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:47.600]   grass-fed. Learn to cook with that. Learn to make sausages. And I don't necessarily always
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.720]   mean links either. I mean different types of sausages. I can spend five minutes with a pound
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.440]   of ground meat and you tell me what you want to eat that day. You want chorizo? You want to go
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.760]   Mexican? Do you want something that's more Italian? I could go anywhere with that with my spice
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:08.000]   cabinet. That's another way to cut costs. Growing some of your own food is a huge thing that you can
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.160]   do to cut costs, including, I mentioned pastured poultry. Unless you live in an HOA, you probably
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.200]   could raise a couple dozen pastured chickens a year with a chicken tractor. That would be another
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:27.120]   way to cut it. I really think that probably the best thing though is buying bulk beef,
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.040]   grass-fed locally produced. You can probably find someone to do it. If the guy's like, "Well,
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.680]   I only sell whole beefs," or, "I only sell halves," I guarantee you when you tell that guy,
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.640]   "You know what? If you find somebody to split one with, I'll split one," he will call you back in
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.040]   two days. Ask me how I know. The guy that says, "I don't do that," two days later, he'll call you
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.760]   back and go, "Hey, I found you a guy." Sooner or later, he's going to run into somebody else
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.200]   that says the same thing, and he wants that cow salt. Those are some of the things we can do.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.880]   Looking to eggs, the best, most expensive eggs are still cheap by the calorie. That is a huge
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:12.240]   step in the right direction. Then also looking to fish and seafood, I recently found a product
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:18.560]   by a company called Wild Planet, and it's Atlantic mackerel. Mackerel have a bad rap as being high
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.360]   in mercury. If you're eating king mackerel, yes, these are big fish. They live a long time.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.840]   Atlantic mackerel grow like a pound, pound and a half. They're a small fish, low on the food chain,
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.200]   safer than the safest tuna from a mercury standpoint. I thought, "Well, this is going
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.120]   to be like a sardine, but I like a good sardine, so I'll try it." No. If you've ever eaten really
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.720]   expensive Italian jarred tuna, really firm flesh, some of it's gourmet, even it'll come out of a
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.280]   jar. That's what this stuff's like, and it's like three bucks a can. It's high in omega-3s,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.680]   which is something we struggle to get even on grass-fed beef. It's incredibly healthy. It's
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.320]   inexpensive. There's a lot of other seafoods that we can look to like that. Sardines are a great
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.600]   example. Anchovies are a great example of a way to up the protein and the fat from a good quality
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.200]   standpoint. Then the other thing we could do, let's say you're like, "Yeah, Jack, I don't have
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.400]   money." You're having to eat more of a factory beef or something like that. Okay, then the
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:22.240]   cheapest cuts of beef are the lean cuts of beef, with the exception of filet mignon. If you look
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.400]   at a rib eye, it's really expensive. Sirloin costs less. It's a lot leaner. Eye of round is even less,
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.680]   and it's a lot leaner. Well, factory beef, I don't like the way the animals are treated,
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:39.360]   period. That's where I stand arm in arm with a vegan. I cannot make a case for factory beef,
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.520]   but it is what it is. If it's what you got to eat, it's what you got to eat. Then focus on
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:52.160]   eating that at a very lean, look for the 97% lean ground, etc. Buy that lean cut of beef,
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.520]   and then get your fats from other sources where it's less expensive to do so, like olive oil,
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.560]   and avocados, and avocado oil, and things like that. Then broaden your palate. I meet people
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.720]   all the time, and you eat avocados and everything. Well, not everything, but a lot. Yeah, I like me
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.840]   some avocados. Some people just like, they don't really care. I don't know if you like avocados,
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.480]   I don't care for the taste. Try taking avocado, cube up half an avocado, and throw it in a soup
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.760]   right at the end, and let the heat warm through it. It doesn't taste the same anymore. It pulls
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:29.200]   in the flavor of the soup. Figuring creative ways to get the fat content up with lesser expensive
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.600]   proteins, and since you should be getting the majority of your calories from the fat anyway,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:42.000]   things like, again, coconut oil, MCT oils, avocado oil. Doing that to get the fat up,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.440]   you can reduce the cost of this. I actually think we spend less on groceries today than we did six
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:55.440]   months ago. Because as you know, you can only eat so much when you eat this way. It will eventually
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.400]   self-moderate, so you eat less food. Then you can splurge once in a while, and make up a cheese board
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.000]   with some really expensive cured meats and stuff like that, and you can live a little bit here and
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.040]   there. Overall, I don't think it's really as hard as people make it out to be. Like I said,
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.680]   it's expensive, but they're spending $1,000 a month on insulin.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:22.560]   Yeah, I agree. One of the challenges for me, I've always been annoyed with this category of food,
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.760]   because I believe your body is made of the food that you eat. So I want to have high-quality food.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.680]   I don't mind spending more on food, because I believe it has a ripple effect in other areas
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.560]   of your life. I think it's a good investment. The challenge is knowing which foods.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.600]   And so I concur with everything that you said. My strategies have been basically what you have said
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:50.000]   to try to do that. Number one is we have a garden. We're trying to continue to increase the amount of
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.520]   vegetables that our garden produces. I think that it's hard to find a higher return than the
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.880]   difference of the cost of some seeds versus the value of produce that gets spat out on the other
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.400]   side from gardening, even if it's just mainstream conventional gardening. And in our case, I do it
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.840]   because I want my kids in the garden, and I want to be in the garden, et cetera. But that's been
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.000]   good to lower the cost of some vegetables. And by growing the vegetables that grow easily where I
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.840]   live, that allows me to buy some of the other vegetables and still moderate that. I buy pastured
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:28.160]   eggs from a local producer, but I would like to expand and be able to produce more eggs myself.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.040]   I just haven't developed the infrastructure. And then I buy raw milk and raw cream and whatnot
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:39.440]   from another local producer. And then to save on the meat, I've been able to find pastured
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:45.520]   chickens from a local producer. And then I'm in the process of negotiating for buying a cow.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:52.560]   And buying a whole beef, and it definitely changes dramatically on the price. But one example I would
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.520]   say is interestingly, there's this one guy on Instagram goes under the handle of thankful
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:05.120]   carnivore. And this guy has been eating exclusively ground beef and bacon, three meals a day for the
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.160]   last almost two years. And he eats every for three meals a day, he eats a hamburger patty,
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.240]   and several slices of bacon. And the thing about that is I don't intend to eat that way. I like
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.640]   diversity. I want to eat all kinds of different animals. I don't want to do that. But for him,
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:28.480]   it was a cure to his lifelong depression. And he is just does tremendously on that diet.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.880]   And his Costco shopping trips are very simple. And in a lot of ways,
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.880]   buys a couple of tubes of ground beef and a big box of bacon. And in reality, that's a more
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.840]   satiating diet than a lot of other things I have seen. In his case, I don't advocate it. But in his
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.800]   case, he credits it with tremendous improvements in his life. So more power to him. So yeah,
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.280]   ground beef and hamburgers is certainly a fine way to have food and grass fed ground beef is
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.000]   fairly inexpensive. Jack, let's- It's expensive and you can get creative with it. Real quick
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.280]   there, I wanted to give you something because I just learned about this with growing your own food.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.280]   And you know, for me, like, you know, my background. So for me to learn something new about
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.920]   growing your own food is today is like, you would think I have the encyclopedia on it.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:21.760]   A guy asked me about something called crack key hydroponics. And I'm like, oh, geez, here's
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.640]   another thing. Because I've seen so much of this where like, somebody wants to make money. So they
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.840]   come up with a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. And I'm like, oh, yeah, but I'll look into
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.000]   it. I, when my listeners ask, I look into it. This is probably the easiest, fastest way to get into
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.720]   growing your own food I've ever seen in my life. You get a $10 rubbermaid tub, cut some holes in
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.440]   it. You put some net cups in it and some rockwool and you drop your lettuce seeds or whatever in
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.760]   there. You fill it up with water and you mix in your fertilizer. And then you close it up and
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.720]   you don't do anything. There's no pumps, there's no moving water, there's no nothing. And I thought
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.800]   this was a scam till I looked into it. What happens is the water gets used by the plant.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.160]   The water level starts dropping. The roots get bigger. And the biggest thing, the reason we
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.560]   move water and aquaponics, hydroponics, et cetera, is because the roots need oxygen.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.280]   By just letting the water evaporate and the growth, these people get this stupid. And
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.320]   I've looked at this stuff now and I see these guys and they're growing all of the greens for
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:27.200]   their family. And they're spending, you know, 50, well, once they buy the 25 bucks worth of stuff,
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.040]   they're spending about 50 cents a month to grow all the greens like a family of six can eat.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:38.400]   And I was blown away by that. So I just wanted to put that out because, you know, we're in a
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:46.320]   radical personal finance show here. And I've been growing food for my family since I was a kid,
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.960]   growing it for my grandfather. And for somebody to show me something completely new, that is not
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.240]   normal. And it's like, here's another thing. I got to do this now just as a project, just for
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.920]   my people. But that would be, to me, if you wanted to start producing some of your own food,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.240]   extremely high quality for as cheap as possible, it costs money to build one raised bed. Lumber's
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:16.000]   expensive. And then if you have to get soil, soil's expensive. This, again, it's called Kratky,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.480]   K-R-A-T-K-Y. Just Google that and my God, the food you can make. And then like you said on the
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.920]   ground beef, if you want to do what that guy's doing, just remember there's more than one way
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.160]   to make ground beef. They don't have to all be burgers. Yeah. And I guess the other, I'll check
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:35.600]   out the Kratky thing because to try that just for our place, one of the challenges, we don't live
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.040]   in the US anymore. And so getting like the pumps and all of the stuff that's so easy just to order
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:45.280]   on Amazon is more challenging for me now. But I found it Kratky, K-R-A-T-K-Y. Other tools for
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:53.120]   low cost cuts of beef, also sous vide, salted steak and a crock pot can make cheap cuts of
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.760]   meat taste a whole lot better. Jack, let's finish with talking about prepping. Real quick on the
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.920]   sous vide. All right, go ahead. The sous vide. Get a sous vide machine. You got to get one.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.960]   The cheapest cut of meat you will find in a market that's grass fed and high quality is lamb
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.680]   shoulder chops. Nobody wants them because there's so much fat in them and the lamb fat is really
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.840]   assertive. You put that in a sous vide machine for five hours, you think God cooked for you.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:21.600]   So get a sous vide, absolutely. And give that a shot. Anyway, go ahead.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.680]   And you taught me something about lamb that I had never thought of. That basically all lamb
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:32.000]   that you buy, though it be labeled conventional, is effectively grass fed. There really aren't any
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.280]   commercial feeding operations, any CAFOs for lamb. It just does better on grass. And so
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.480]   if you want non-labeled grass fed meat, buy lamb. I had never thought of that before,
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:49.280]   but I think that's absolutely a great tip. Ground lamb is cheap. Ground lamb is about $6.50 a pound
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.360]   at Albertsons and it's all grass fed because it doesn't make any economic sense to feed a lamb
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:00.480]   grain. And if you use a seasoning called Ras el Hanout, which is a Moroccan seasoning, about a
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.560]   tablespoon of that to a pound of lamb and then do whatever you want with it, throw some bacon in it.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.080]   And that's pretty amazing. I'm getting hungry. All right, let's talk about prepping. One of the
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.280]   interesting things that I've thought a lot about over the years, and I used to remember this when
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:18.640]   you would talk about, you used to do shows on your show about eating paleo and prepping,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.720]   paleo of course avoiding grain. One of the challenges, the staples of preparedness food
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:31.200]   is often grain, buckets of wheat, buckets of rice, beans, et cetera. If you walk away from
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.240]   most of that food, it changes your entire strategy with regard to food preparedness.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:43.520]   How do you think about the philosophy of food preparedness when eating in a ketogenic manner?
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.640]   So let's just look at it this way. Let's say you're worried about the apocalypse. Fine,
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.320]   store up some buckets of beans and rice and wheat. They'll last for 25 years. Put them in the back
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.400]   of the closet and forget about them. And if the world ends, you can go ahead and eat them.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.560]   I mean, that doesn't follow eat what you store and store what you eat, but if you're that worried
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:09.440]   about having more than about 30 to 60 days of sustainability, go ahead and do that. So you can
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.720]   still have the beans and the bullets and the band-aids in the back if you need it. But I do
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.640]   try to practice eat what you store and store what you eat. And as I said, one of the easiest things
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.080]   to do is get a good deep freezer and get a generator. You should have a generator as a
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.480]   prepper anyway. The number one prep I've used in the last 20 years has been my generators, actually,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.240]   in so many ways. When I lived in Arkansas, we lived at the end of the end of the end.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.800]   And when the power went out for us, there might be 13 people without power. And 15 miles away in
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:45.520]   town, there's 20,000. The electric company is just fixing their stuff. You couldn't even get mad
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.320]   about it. How do you get like, well, of course, they're going to do that first. So we learn the
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   value of a generator. So store meat. You can also, you can can meat. I used to recommend
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.920]   All-American canners. They're probably still the best pressure canner on the market. But
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:08.720]   I also recommend things that people will use. Keri Shard is the company. Keri Shard makes one
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.480]   that is an electric pressure canner. It's kind of like the Instant Pot, except it actually is good
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:18.720]   for canning meats. So you can can meats. That's another way to extend things. Learn to make
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.200]   biltong if you really want to store your protein up. And biltong is so superior to jerky. Oh,
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.840]   by the way, do not think you're keto or low carb and go to the store and buy beef jerky.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.400]   There's more beef jerky and a five, there's more sugar in a five ounce bag of beef jerky
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.880]   than there is in a can of Coca-Cola. Go check that out and you'll see I'm dead on with it.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:42.160]   So those are ways that we can do this. And I mentioned before, seafoods, especially canned
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.720]   fish. Canned fish is one of the best stores of fat you can have. The mackerel I mentioned.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.680]   There's a sardine brand that I recommend called Matisse Gallego. It's probably the best quality
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.720]   sardine in the world. It's still a sardine, but that's incredibly high quality protein.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.520]   You can buy canned meats. You can buy canned chicken and canned beef. I generally don't
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.600]   like that because it's about the worst of the worst of factory. But if you're eating factory
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:15.920]   anyway, you can do that. But probably the number one way you can store your meat products is if you
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:23.360]   can get into homesteading. Don't kill your rabbit until you want to eat it. You follow me there.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:31.200]   So we can set up a rabbit tree and I can produce more rabbit meat with a rabbit tree with let's
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:38.400]   say three does and one buck rabbit than you could from a couple of meat goats a year. And I don't
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.360]   have to actually slaughter those young bunnies until I'm ready to eat them. And I have the
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.080]   incredible high quality protein then. And if I have a place where I can grow lots of grass,
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.760]   I can feed grass and clover. I can feed them mostly with a bag mower.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:58.160]   So it all depends about your individual situation. But I think that the idea that
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.360]   all of a sudden we can't store food because we're not storing rice. And I ask these people to say
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:09.840]   that like, how much rice do you eat right now? And it turns out most of them don't eat a lot of rice.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.880]   They don't eat a lot of beans. And they might eat a lot of wheat and corn, but they don't eat it in
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.360]   the form of raw wheat and raw corn. They eat it in the form of processed foods from the store.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:26.560]   So that means that they're storing food that they, unless the zombies come, they're never
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.040]   going to eat it anyway. So it doesn't really affect me much. And then gardening, things like
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.160]   the crack key hydroponics, that's quick turnover food. Learning to grow things like micro greens
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:42.480]   is another awesome way. So now we can store seeds that can turn into vegetables very, very quickly.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:51.600]   Like we could grow a black oil sunflower into sunflower micro greens in about 10 to 14 days.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.000]   And once we have that happening, we can have a new crop coming in every day with almost no
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.200]   effort whatsoever. And I'm not suggesting maybe that you do this, but I'm also suggesting that
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.800]   maybe it's not as important to buy organic as you think when it comes to something like black oil
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.480]   sunflowers. So I don't know if you know any farmers, Josh, but they don't tend to spend money
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:13.920]   unless they have to. Like they don't spray chemicals just because they want to spray
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:20.640]   chemicals. They spray chemicals because they have to. Well, nothing really is a pest on sunflowers.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.360]   And sunflowers don't really have to worry about weeds because they grow so tall. So the sunflower
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   seeds that you buy for like 16 bucks for a 50 pound bag of tractor supply have never been
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:40.080]   sprayed with anything. So if you really had to eat on the cheap and you wanted to grow your own food,
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:45.360]   you could be growing sunflower micro greens for a ridiculously low price. And by the way,
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   for you keto people, they're actually high in fat. So it's like so many ways. I mean,
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.400]   I could keep going, but I mean, it's just not really that hard. If you just think about what
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:03.280]   you're consuming and how do I make sure I have food for the next month or two. And as a prepper,
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:10.560]   I'm all about the people that want to be ready for a year. But I'm also about common sense and
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:16.800]   what works for the most people. If you can get through 60 to 90 days with food, water, shelter,
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:22.160]   energy, and money, you're going to get through 90% of what will ever go wrong in your life.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.800]   So that's my day is kind of like about 90 days for 90%.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:32.320]   Yeah. Yeah, I agree. And obviously the human body is incredible. We can eat so many diverse
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.040]   types of foods. For me, from the prepping perspective, the thing that I just thought
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:44.080]   really opened my eyes when I recognized that, wait a second, it is actually possible to thrive
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.000]   on a diet exclusively of meat, which, yeah, I knew that the Inuit ate meat and fat. But
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.160]   when I actually tried it and said, I'm thriving and I only eat meat again, I think I'll probably
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.880]   go back to vegetables because I don't see any reason not to. But there are people who just
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.000]   are thriving and been for decades on just that. Then it kind of changes the whole dynamic. And
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.240]   I realized that. Well, let me ask you this, right? The Inuit were living on all that fat and meat
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:19.440]   for that long. Where's their deep freezer? Where's their root cellar? If you look at the people that
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:26.880]   live in the outback of Australia, the Aborigines, it's very warm there. They somehow managed to
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:32.880]   survive with no grocery store. They don't run to the grocery store or the indigenous cultures in
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.480]   Africa or the indigenous cultures of South America, the few that are left, New Guinea,
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:43.120]   all over the world, these cultures live and they primarily live off of animal food. One of my
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.000]   challenges to vegans has always been, since this is supposedly the way humans are supposed to eat,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.360]   show me a vegan indigenous culture, go. You get a lot of autistic level screeching,
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:58.640]   but you don't get a lot of answers to that one. >> Right. And from a prepping perspective,
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:08.160]   if animal flesh is your primary source of nutrition, the thing that animals do better
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:12.320]   than anything else in the world is take stuff that people don't eat and turn it into stuff
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:20.080]   that people do. You could take a brushy overgrown lot and put some goats or put a cow on there,
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.880]   and they'll take stuff that's nasty and gross and turn it into stuff that is delicious on your grill.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:30.640]   And so in many ways, if you, now this doesn't work in the city, I'm just drawing a fun example,
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.160]   but if you calculate that each year I eat three quarters of a cow,
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:40.720]   then you're, and that's how much steak it takes to keep me fed for a year. Then you simply
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:45.680]   calculate the number of cows that you can produce per year and you put cows on the grass pasture
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.480]   out back and you keep them alive. And if you do that, you have a sustainable source of food. You
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:56.080]   have a milk cow that provides you with milk to drink and you have a new, a fresh beef cow every
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:02.000]   year as they grow up to a butchering size. And obviously that is why meat has always been a
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.360]   primary component of the human diet is because animals take stuff that people don't eat and turn
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.800]   it into stuff that we do. And it's a whole lot easier to go out and butcher a cow than it is to
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.600]   garden enough vegetables to keep you alive for a year. There's just no comparison.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.040]   Give me a few number one and a half
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:29.440]   coal spring traps and drop me off in the woods and I'll feed myself. Drop me off in suburbia,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:35.120]   I'll feed myself. I might be eating raccoon, but anybody that says raccoon is not good to eat
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.800]   probably never ate one or you ate one with somebody too stupid to take out the glands.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.680]   And then there's a couple of glands that need to come out of them. But I mean, you put me anywhere
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.840]   on this planet and there are critters that live there that I can trap and or shoot and eat.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:55.200]   One of my favorite ways of hunting involves driving around in my truck and looking for a
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.280]   deer that didn't make it last night. They got hit by somebody else in the vehicle. It's technically
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.120]   illegal here, but I've had a cop help me put a deer in the back of my truck. So I don't think
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.720]   they're enforcing that real hard. And people say, "Oh my God, you ate roadkill." Well, you ate a cow
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.120]   that somebody put a bolt through its head. I mean, I don't really understand the difference there
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.080]   other than if there's damage to the meat or whatever. So there's always something to eat.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:25.760]   I mean, I have not been in an ecosystem yet where I couldn't figure out how to feed myself off of
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:30.800]   other living creatures. I have been in ecosystems where if you told me I'm not allowed to do that,
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.680]   I would be very hungry very fast. Yeah, absolutely. Jack, anything we haven't
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:41.440]   covered on this subject? I think the only thing I'd like to just a couple of words on for people
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:48.240]   here toward the end of this is cancer because it is one of our leading causes of deaths. And I know
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.240]   that there's this belief that a lot of people have that eating a lot of meat is going to get you
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.640]   cancer. And there just really isn't a lot of proof for that because again, all the studies that say,
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.040]   "Well, this person eats a lot of meat." Well, they're eating lasagna, right? That's... Come on.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:10.320]   Like eating meat the way we're talking about today. There is one thing that is cancer's Achilles heel,
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:17.520]   and that is every cell in your body can survive without sugar. Your body can make enough glucose
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:24.160]   for the limited things that are necessary from protein you consume and a process called gluconeogenesis.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:31.040]   The tumor has to have sugar. It has to. It cannot live on ketone bodies.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:39.120]   And we're talking like PhD level research being done right now that shows that we just go straight
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.240]   standard of care therapy for cancer. The thing that everybody... Chemo, radiation, whatever.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:50.880]   Coupled with ketogenic, extremely low carb eating has better survival rates for cancer. And it makes
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.640]   perfect sense. We're starving the tumor. Then you go to some nutritionist that puts his cancer
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.720]   patients on carrot juice. The guy should be... Honestly, should be killed and buried for doing
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:06.480]   that. You're throwing gas on a fire when you give sugar to a cancer patient. So now that's fact.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:13.600]   Now I'm going to go to my opinion. My opinion is if cutting sugar extremely during standard of care
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.920]   treatment for a person who already has cancer is helpful, it should be the case that we're at least
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:27.520]   on some level in the right school of thought for prevention of many cancers by doing it before.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:35.600]   Or even if the person is going to get a cancer, it should slow the progression. And a slow moving
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.080]   cancer is easier to treat than a fast moving one. We always hope we catch it early is a thing.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.720]   So I think that there's a tremendous benefit toward the prevention and treatment of cancer
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.880]   here. There's more research that needs to be done. And I do want to be clear, I am not saying
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.600]   keto cures cancer. And I'm not saying certainly keto is right for all cancers. For instance,
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:00.320]   I've learned like a ton of research. There is a rare form of breast cancer. And then there's a
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.360]   mutation of that rare form that actually is aggravated and grows faster in some of the
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:11.840]   byproducts of ketogenesis. So if you had that particular, like would be like one 10th of 1%
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.240]   of all cancers, it probably would be bad. So there's always an exception. But I think if we
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.680]   follow kind of the rule of thumb with how cancer and we look at cancer's progression, and sugar in
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.360]   the diet, it seems to me that people have like the trifecta of things that people worry about from
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   health. Type 2 diabetes and metabolic problems, heart disease and cancer, we're better off all
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.880]   around. And the fourth one is obesity. So I would challenge anybody in your audience, if you doubt
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.760]   this, do what my 50 people did in my 40 day challenge. Give yourself 40 days, follow what
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.840]   Josh is talking about, follow what I'm talking about, and tell me how you feel in 40 days.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.760]   I mean, I would go to, I don't know about you, I would go to like hardcore prison for 40 days for
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:01.360]   $10 million. I mean, like, there's not much, like, if you'd be 10 million, 10 million, right? Yeah,
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.800]   I mean, I might, I might get myself thrown in the hole and spend 40 days in solitary, somebody
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:10.560]   shivs me or nothing. But I'll do about anything for $10 million, as long as it's moral and legal.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.320]   40 days of eating really good food for the possibility of transforming your life. It's
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.440]   not a big sacrifice, folks. I want to add to that list. Have you read anything, any of the research
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.920]   or noticed anything that people some researchers are doing on Alzheimer's and low carbohydrate?
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:32.720]   Yes. I can't believe we didn't talk about that. Go ahead. The the cutting edge research. And again,
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:39.600]   this is mostly like PhD students doing their thesis is this has become a thing to do now.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.520]   And one thing is important with science, a study that says something means nothing to me,
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.520]   you have to have this guy does a study, he publishes his study and his methodology.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:52.400]   This guy over here takes the methodology and repeats the result. Now you got some, and they're
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:58.320]   getting highly repeatable results here to the conclusion they're coming to is that Alzheimer's
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:06.080]   most likely is diabetes of the brain. And that is earth shattering, that should be on every television
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.000]   station, every news report, but it doesn't benefit the people in power to tell you this.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.200]   And so what and they know this to be a fact that we think of somebody has type two diabetes,
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:21.120]   it's I hate the word diabetes where it's not diabetes, it's insulin resistance. So you have
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:26.080]   a person, it's not that they can't make insulin, their pancreas is making too much insulin,
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.200]   but their cells have become so resistant to insulin from from high blood sugar their whole life,
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:36.320]   that that cell can't get the energy in anymore. So the pancreas is working overtime to get the
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:42.080]   sugar out of the blood. So what does the doctor come along and do gives them more insulin? I mean,
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.240]   it should be up, this should be actually a crime to do this, honestly, that person immediately
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.960]   should have their blood sugar cut. That's the solution. Well, that's type two diabetes,
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.600]   it's really insulin resistance. But what we've learned is individual systems and individual
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:03.840]   organs can develop independent resistance to insulin. So your pancreas can develop its own
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.360]   resistance to its own insulin, your liver can, your intestinal tract and your brain can. Well,
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.680]   we thought more settled science right until about 15 years ago, they thought the brain could only
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:18.320]   run on glucose. It was the only thing a brain could run on. Turns out, you know what your brain
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.640]   can run on fat, it's made out of fat. So that makes sense, runs on ketone bodies just fine.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:30.720]   When you go low carb, and they're not creating this insulin resistance, it's very it's not
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:36.960]   proven yet, but it's very promising that it can be helpful with Alzheimer's. The most amazing thing
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:42.400]   that they've done is they're able to put radioactive markers, it's substances that go into
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.640]   your body. So they can see everybody's seen, you know, scans where they do this and see where it
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.440]   gets into your body. You take a dementia patient, you give them a bunch of glucose with this
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:57.280]   radioactive marker, you scan their brain. And it's horrifying when you realize what's going on,
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:01.360]   when you actually see it, you see the brain light up and there's a site, you know, thing the size of
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:08.480]   a baseball in the center of their brain, it's dead. No energy goes into their brain. And you
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.520]   look at that goal, that is horrifying as Alzheimer's did, it becomes more horrifying. It's the brain
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.720]   dying from the inside out. Like take the same patients and they give them something called MCT
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.760]   oil, which is a medium chain triglyceride. And we're long so I don't want to get too deep here.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.480]   But this is just simply a fat that can be used almost instantly. Even a lot of the fats that
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.800]   are very easy for your body to use, they have to go to liver, they have to be synthesized. MCT goes
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:36.960]   right through the intestinal wall gets one little modification, and it's off to provide energy.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:46.320]   Your brain, your little three pound brain uses 40% of the calories you consume a day.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:55.760]   So it's an energy hog. Those MCT marked molecules, like that part of the brain up in an Alzheimer's
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:02.720]   patient that can't use glucose in the brain anymore. It turns the brain on, they could
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:09.520]   actually scan it and look at it and see it. So we have so much there with just eating this way may
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:14.080]   in fact reduce this epidemic of Alzheimer's. How old are you, Josh? You're like similar to my age,
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.040]   right? No, I'm 34.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.600]   34, so you're younger. So maybe you don't remember. I'm almost 50. When I was a kid,
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.680]   like there was one old person, it was crazy. That's what we called it back then. We didn't
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.160]   even understand what it was. We said they had dementia, they were crazy. We didn't really call
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.120]   it Alzheimer's yet. And it would be like there's a hundred old people, there's like one or two that
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.080]   had lost their faculties. Now it seems like every third one by the time they're in their 80s is
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.400]   having these issues. Well, they didn't eat the way we did back then. So the eating may do it,
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.280]   but even people that are already there, I wish I would have noticed when my father-in-law went
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:51.280]   through this, just giving them a tablespoon of MCT oil a day is not fixing the problem,
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:57.680]   but it's mitigating the condition. And we're coming up to the realization that almost every
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.200]   chronic disease we have today is dietarily related. And if you think about what we've
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:08.800]   done to ourselves, we had, most people used to die of infectious diseases. If you go back a
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:15.520]   hundred years, they died of typhoid, they died of polio. And science came along and did amazing
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:22.320]   things with drugs in treating infectious diseases. We've pretty much beaten most infectious diseases.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.040]   And if we have a new infectious disease, we can beat it pretty quickly. Usually we're screwing
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.760]   some things up with resistant bacteria, antibiotics, but overall we can handle it.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.440]   Then we created these chronic conditions that didn't used to exist with diet. And we're trying
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.080]   to medicate them away with drugs, where diet is actually the solution. Thank you for bringing
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:47.440]   that up because I think that's going to, that was one of my greatest fears in my life that I would
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.920]   end up with dementia. As a guy that uses his brain for a living, it's a horrifying thought.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.080]   And I'm not saying I don't have to worry about it at all, but I think about it a lot less now.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:02.400]   Yeah, absolutely. And I think there are, I agree. I can't find any evidence to say
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:10.880]   that carbohydrates are, that large consumption of carbohydrates is very important for most people.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.640]   Maybe, I don't, you know, they argue about it in the athletic world. I'm not competent to assess
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:22.800]   that, but it does seem to me that I can find story after story after story. And I can find
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:30.000]   many competent medical professionals that say, say, and show that basically type two diabetes
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.080]   is completely treatable with carbohydrate restriction. Obesity is almost completely
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.760]   treatable with carbohydrate restriction. There's the interesting discussions on Alzheimer's,
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:46.720]   which is, I mean, I've been through it with my grandfather and it's horrifying. It's one of the
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.040]   worst things out there. And it makes sense when you read what some of them are testing. Now,
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.600]   I don't know. Well, if you, if you, again, like it's not proven, but if you had a drug
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.640]   that did what MCT oil did, right. A freaking supplement you can buy from Amazon. If you had
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.600]   a drug that did that, it would be patented and it would be being prescribed across the country.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:11.040]   There'd be a million commercials for it on Fox news tomorrow. Right? Right. And it's just there
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.440]   and it can't hurt you. Right. And it hurt you, I guess.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.320]   Agreed. Agreed. And there's no, and when you say, okay, I'm going to try at least I'm going to try,
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:24.720]   I'm going to do three months on a low carbohydrate diet. It's such a look, it can be such a luxurious
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.000]   way to eat and it can have all these other benefits. There's no reason not to try it for
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.520]   yourself and to see if your N equals one results are worth pursuing farther because you and I,
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.720]   as individuals, we are the ones that are the most important. And I've gone through the emotions of
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.000]   being, I spent years just frustrated. Like what is wrong with me? What is wrong with my body?
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.960]   Why on earth is this happening? I don't eat badly. Um, and so I've been in that place. And then
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.320]   I've also been in the place where, man, it makes a big difference. I've never felt better than I do
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.160]   right now. And just the mental clarity, the physical energy, et cetera. It's, it brings
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.520]   back your zest for life. And there's one thing about money. It is very difficult to be productive
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:17.360]   when you don't feel well. It's very difficult to be productive when you lack self-confidence.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.240]   It's very difficult to be productive when you're dealing with all kinds of health issues. If
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.600]   there's one thing that's going to derail your income, get sick. If there's one thing that's
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.760]   going to destroy your money, get cancer. And so we owe it to ourselves to become highly educated
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:38.480]   and to experiment with each of our bodies to find the ideal human diet for us. Jack, um, close it
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.080]   out. Anything you want to say, the survival podcast, tell us about some of your projects,
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.200]   uh, because there's a lot of overlap between our audiences. So close us out for today.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:51.680]   Well, I mean, if, if you want to kind of check out everything I do, the best thing to do is go
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:57.360]   to the survival podcast.com. We do focus a lot on preparedness, but really what my podcast is
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.480]   about is lifestyle design. Uh, being a good marketer back in 2008, when I started the show,
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.840]   we have over 2,500 episodes. Now I knew if I called it the lifestyle design podcast,
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:12.320]   I mean, this is before Tim Ferriss became like a rockstar God on the internet. Like I would get
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.360]   like three people listening. So I went with what was hot, which was preparedness, which I think
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.040]   lifestyle resiliency is preparedness. That's, that's what we really talk about. So if you can
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:26.800]   think of it, I mean, from traditional things you would think of in a show like mine, like
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:32.480]   off-grid living, basic preparedness, disaster preparedness, we cover that, but we cover the
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:40.000]   economics, we cover entrepreneurship, we cover, you know, lifestyle design, lifetime education.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.800]   I just did a show this week, 10, 10 skills that you should teach your children. And I guarantee
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.320]   if you listen to that show and you teach your kids that your kids will be millionaires by the time
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.720]   they're 30, if your kids are young right now, if they follow the advice on that show. Uh, it's,
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.960]   it's just really about living a better life. And that fact, that's our tagline. We have the worst
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.600]   tagline ever, but it says what it, what it is and does what it says. And that is helping you live a
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   better life. If times get tough or even if they don't, and that's what we're all about. You can
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.120]   check us out and everything else I do, you can find from there. And if you want to know what
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:14.720]   I'm doing with keto again, it's called Jack's Low Carb Journey is the, uh, the playlist. And, uh,
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.480]   you can either find it for everybody or I can send you a link, Josh. Um, there is the one out of
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.960]   those 40 odd videos now that is, you know, nuts and bolts, exactly how I manage keto for what I
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.120]   do. It doesn't mean you should too, but yeah, it worked for me. It might work for you. Try it. And
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:38.960]   then at least what I say is like, start with something that is organized with keto. These
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.440]   people would say to do lazy keto, dirty keto, whatever. Start with something organized that's
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:50.560]   proven to work. And then you can decide, well, I want to add or take away from it. That way you're
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.600]   starting from something that's a no. And some people tell me like, I get a recipe for making
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.200]   bread, make it the way the recipe is, and then decide if you want to throw walnuts in it. Right?
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.880]   So it's that same type of thinking, start with something like that. And you know, if anybody
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.960]   has any questions for me, you know, they can ask if you have like, you know, blog notes or whatever
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:09.360]   in, and I'll, I'll be happy to kind of come by and answer those or they can get in touch with
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.960]   me directly. Absolutely. And Jack's low carb journey is all on YouTube. So just go to YouTube.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.080]   Jack, thank you for coming on. And I want to close it just with one closing note.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.560]   Um, the reason why I brought Jack on to discuss this subject instead of going and pursuing,
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.400]   you know, doctor so-and-so is because what I have found is that there are some experts who are very
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.640]   good teachers. You know, Jack mentioned, um, some of the people that he really appreciates on
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.800]   YouTube, Dr. Ken Barry and the keto couple, et cetera. But a lot of times the best person to
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.720]   teach a subject to somebody who's just a little bit beyond because that person can understand
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:49.120]   what it was like to be a little bit before. And so that's where with, you know, Jack's a polymath,
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.480]   he, he, he's a self educator, but he's studied it and understood it, but being just a little bit
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.920]   beyond allows somebody like Jack or somebody like me who says, I know what it was like six months
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.800]   ago. And let me tell you how I've overcome that. And what I have found is that learning from people
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.000]   who are just a little bit farther ahead is sometimes better and more effective than learning
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.960]   from somebody who's 20 years ahead. There's a big, if you're deeply in debt, you got credit card debt.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.480]   You don't go talk to a billionaire and say, how do I become a billionaire? Because you're not going
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.120]   to connect with that. You start with somebody who's a little bit ahead of you. And then as you
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.080]   grow, you keep pushing up on and on because then you'll people will be able to give you advice that
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.120]   you can implement. So Jack, I think you did a great job and I thank you for coming on the show.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.520]   I appreciate you having me, Joshua.
