[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.900]   and of course they call things like a potato and a vegetable so what that means that's supposed to be based on sugar.

[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.020]   That's the advice that the government's giving us.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.900]   And it's what they've been giving us in earnest since the 70s.

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.380]   And it sounds like it makes sense when you just listen to it because we've been programmed to believe this our whole lives.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.120]   And obviously grains are healthy, but grains are sugar.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.920]   And what's happened since we've been in the middle of this,

[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:39.780]   that's a question for you can you name an animal in the world that requires caloric moderation to stay healthy unless we put it in the zoo that's an excellent an excellent analogy because certainly not there is not right there's nothing there's no animal anywhere on the planet that has to count calories until we alter its natural diet so why would human beings be the only creature that can't count calories until we alter its natural diet so why would human beings be the only creature that can't
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:39.780]   be the only creature that can't count calories until we alter its natural diet so why would human beings be the only creature that can't
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   moderate calories I'm not saying calories don't matter what I'm saying is when we eat the right way our bodies largely will self moderate now what I had to learn about this and this is part of my roller coaster is when you are obese and you have been eating the wrong way a long time you've been shocking your body with sugar for a long time even help I don't care if it's I don't care if it's honey the healthiest sugar in the world you've been doing that a long time you're basically a carbohydrate addict and you're a food addict and so when you make this shift you're a food addict and so when you make this shift you're a food addict and so when you make this shift you're a food addict
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:39.820]  ,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   you go look at the same species in nature they don't have any problems the only real difference is the diet or think about this Josh you look at you take two kids eight year old boy eight year old girl about the same height and I put them facing away from you and all you see the silhouette you can't see anything but a silhouette no hairstyles no nothing you can't tell me which one the boy and the girl is at that age assuming they're about the same way you can't help right okay so now let's move them on to about 18
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   you can't tell me which one the boy and the girl is at that age assuming they're about the same way you can't help right okay so now let's move them on to about 18
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:39.860]   in the exact same diet they're about the same weight and I show you the silhouette of
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:39.860]   the exact same diet they're about the same weight and I show you the silhouette of those two individuals you could tell me the boy from the girl like that it's easy okay because she's curvier chest chest fat on her hips okay they're eating the same food what told her body to put that fat on her hips to retain that extra weight there to have to put that because it's fat that makes the body look different on a female from male they retain more fat hormones did it right hormones did it so if we get our hormones

And so I have my entire life been a vegetable eater. You know, we eat vegetables multiple times per day. My kids, my kids will eat plates and plates of vegetables. We we've always done that.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:40.880]   it's been a great journey and it's really I guess it's really it's been obviously very gratifying to lose weight gratifying to lose six inches on your belt etc and especially for men it's been gratifying to do it without having to suffer which in so many diets that you do you about want to kill yourself because you're in constant deprivation with ketogenic or with carnivore or some version of that there's so much satiety in the food that you eat that it's really doable.

That is something that, you know, you can use alcohol responsibly, but if you want to lose weight, you've got to cut out the booze. I mean to like having maybe a drink or two once a week. And then no on that day, you are not going to be burning fat. You have to have your liver functioning optimally for these diets to really, really work. And I know there's people that they drink through it and they lose weight. Okay, so

[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.320]   In other words, it's not a lot of rice flowers and rice cookies and rice cakes and things like that.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:18.180]   They're eating rice is mostly as a whole grain and they never screwed their body up in the first place.
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:27.340]   So I think one of the places, if you would compare it to a drug, there are people that use drugs recreationally and it doesn't screw their life up.

[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:48.420]   You feel so satisfied, you don't feel like you're suffering and that helps the ability to stick to a diet, that helps to stay with it.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:58.420]   And I can show you example after example after example of people who've been eating a pure carnivore diet for, in some cases, almost two decades.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.420]   And they look younger now than they did when they started.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:11.380]   So I don't know if you've ever tried it, but I've been fascinated by my own personal experiment to go all the way to full carnivore and stop eating even vegetables just to see if I can do it.

[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:33.380]   So far, I haven't noticed that I have any sensitivity or any problems with vegetables, which is why I'll go back probably to eating significant amounts of vegetables.

[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.380]   I think it'll be the biggest trend of 2012 or sorry, 2012.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.380]   Well, so let's there's actually a lot to that and remember I'm not a doctor, I don't even play one on TV and I'm not a doctor.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.420]   I'm certainly not a nutritionist, which means I probably know more about nutrition than most nutritionists, but I'm speaking as a layman here and some postulations.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.420]   But I'm speaking as a layman here and some postulations.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.420]   So number one, I've used carnivore whenever I've felt stuck.

[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.460]   But I have done a tremendous amount of research into all of this since I started.

[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.460]   And one of the things that I've learned is that one of the things we're told so much that we need to have is that we need to have a healthy diet.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   And one of the things that I've learned is that one of the things we're told so much that we need to have is that we need to have a healthy diet.

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:48.500]  , and that is fiber.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   And we're always told how important fiber is.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   Fiber, fiber, fiber.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.500]   Well, I've now listened to quite a few different doctors coming from different viewpoints on this of people that have gut problems.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   And the first thing they do is cut the fiber out and the gut problems go away.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   Well, one of the reasons could be that we have so screwed up our intestinal flora that we can't properly digest it.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:52.500]  , and that we can't properly digest it.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:40:18.700]   kind
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:50.780]   that's what I'm doing it with you know artificial sweeteners like Sula crows and additives that are in all of the food that we today may be very therapeutic so that could be part of the issue then I'm also back to Mark Sesson who I don't agree with on everything but I think he's a brilliant man that primal blueprint guy and he was certainly looks like you and I would probably like looking when we're at 66 oh yeah yeah yeah if I'm like that at 66 I'm good right this is the guy that was on the cover of runner's world magazine

One thing we have to reinforce all the way through this, all of this puts more money in your pocket by preventing money from leaving it. People tell me this is expensive. You know what's expensive? Insulin. You know what's expensive? Dialysis. You know what's expensive? Chemotherapy. These things are expensive. Heart transplants are expensive. Heart bypasses are expensive. Stints are expensive. Statins are expensive.

Today we spend 5% of our budget on food and 30% on healthcare. I've never verified those numbers but I think directionally it's probably, probably... I mean I could tell you flat out that my single largest expense is health insurance. And I barely ever go to the doctor. So even if I'm, if you're not paying the bill today for direct medical supplies and treatment, you're paying the bill for others. I mean, so yeah, I actually think that number might be low.

[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:06.260]   and I find it's very easy to practice a compressed eating window or perhaps called intermittent fasting where you eat instead of eating three times per day or seven small meals per day, you eat one or two times per day. And I find that it's very easy to just simply go with get up in the morning, drink some black coffee, and have my first meal around noon, have my second meal around six o'clock. And that practice in and of itself also moderates the calories. So I think the most important thing is the transition period.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:34.300]   It's going to sound different, but it's very similar actually, because I'm going to focus a little bit more on calories, et cetera, but it's the same thing. It's the same, but different man in the words of Tommy Chong. Right? So for about a week to 10 days,

[00:53:34.520 --> 00:54:02.340]   I say do exactly what you said, which is you keep your carbs under 20 and eat as much as you want. Eat, eat until somebody's afraid you're going to eat the sink. If that's what you feel like doing, because during this time, you're going to be making your body do exactly what you said. You're going to make it shift from burning glucose to burning ketone bodies.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:30.380]   And that's a big change. You're asking a lot. It's like taking somebody on heroin and going, no more heroin for you. Here, you can have all of this, like, you know, oranges. You have to live on oranges instead of heroin. Right? I mean, that's what you're doing to your body. So getting through that, and this is one of the biggest, my biggest gripes with Atkins. Dr. Atkins didn't tell anybody that about half of the people that do this are going to feel like they're having a 10 day version of the worst hangover.

[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:59.420]  , is going to feel like a ton of bricks. They call it keto flu. So if you got to eat, consider that your methadone, right? For getting off the meth and you eat through if it's 10 days, if it's 14 days, whatever, and you're going to lose weight in that time. And for some of you that are really overweight, you're going to lose a lot of weight because your body's going to purge water. Most people that are extremely overweight.

[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:57.140]   gdkkdk. I'm sorry. You've got to get through this period of time. So drink like crazy during this time. And you need to be supplementing magnesium and sodium. So salt your food is the best way to do the sodium. A good quality absorbable magnesium and potassium doesn't hurt here either as a supplement, because you're going to be purging those free minerals from your body with all of this water loss.

[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.660]   And you search YouTube for that and you find one of those three people talking about it, you'll probably do really well.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:34.840]   I also have a whole playlist and you can just look up Jack's low-carb journey on Google.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:42.440]   You'll find a playlist. I go through this whole period and I have one particular episode there to make this short.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.480]   it's short but again, it's exactly how I manage my diet. It's about 30 minutes and it's exactly how I manage my diet.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:01:13.760]  , ,,remember, I added it to the notes. Let's talk about money. One of the challenges with personal finance is in general, one of the standard pieces of advice for those of us who try to save money on our grocery budget is eat less meat, eat more rice and beans. You can buy huge amounts of grain extremely inexpensively, whereas finding huge amounts of meat extremely inexpensively is very expensive.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.800]   challenging. So what are your thoughts in terms of managing the cost and having an appropriate budget while also eating in a ketogenic manner?
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   So what are your thoughts in terms of managing the cost and having an appropriate budget while also eating in a ketogenic manner?
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   So before I say this, it sounds like a jerk. I'm going to say that there are people out there who are really living at the edge financially.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   So before I say this, it sounds like a jerk. I'm going to say that there are people out there who are really living at the edge financially.

[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:59.840]   And what I'm about to say doesn't pertain to you at all. But for many people that excuse is total bull.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840]   And what I'm about to say doesn't pertain to you at all. But for many people that excuse is total bull.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:01.840]   Because I look at what they're eating and they're spending more money than I do on food in many instances because they're eating so damn much of it.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   Because I look at what they're eating and they're spending more money than I do on food in many instances because they're eating so damn much of it.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   And yet you can eat cheap on rice and beans. It feeds half the world. And if you have to live that way, I'm not going to make your life worse by telling you you you're wrong. I'm not going to do that. However, we can eat not just meat but good quality.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:03.840]  , but if you can eat not just meat but good quality.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   And we need to be creative about how we shop to do that. But one of the best things you can do is find somebody producing grass fed beef and buy a half or a quarter or even a whole beef and put it in a deep freezer and as a prepper people like what do you do then I have a generator I have a generator and I have 120 gallons of gasoline right so I the last thing I'm worried about when the power goes out is my freezer I only have to run that sucker a couple hours a day and everything will stay frozen in it I'm more worried about
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:03:03.920]   my fish tanks because I want my fish to die. So we could just solve that straight out of the gate with the number one prep you should have anyway is a good generator. But here's some examples of ways that I've reduced the cost of our, our meat. One is Costco and organic poultry. Now I would much rather have, I would rather have pastured chicken than just organic chicken, but organic is better than commercial by a long shot. If you go to the grocery store and you're like, Oh, I want to buy a whole chicken, I'm going to buy a whole chicken.

Because sooner or later he's going to run into somebody else who says the same thing, and he wants that cow salt. So those are some of the things we can do. Looking to eggs, the best, most expensive eggs are still cheap by the calorie. That is a huge step in the right direction. And then also looking to fish and seafood, I recently found a product by a company called Wild Planet, and it's Atlantic mackerel. And mackerel have a bad rap as being a bad rap.

Jack, let's get expensive and you can get creative with it real quick there. I wanted to give you something because I just learned about this with growing your own food. And, you know, for me, like, you know, my background. So for me to learn something new about growing your own food is today is like you would think I'm going to get encyclopedia on it. A guy asked me about something called crack key hydroponics.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:02.580]   ado.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:02.580]   I'm like, oh, geez, here's another thing. It's because I've seen so much of this where like somebody wants to make money. So they come up with a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. And I'm like, oh, yeah, but I'll look into it. My listeners ask I look into it. This is probably the easiest, fastest way to get into growing your own food I've ever seen in my life. You get a $10 Rubbermaid tub, cut some holes in it. You put the net cups in it and some rock wool and you drop your lettuce seeds or whatever in there. You fill it up with water and you mix in your fertilizer.

[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:13.300]   It's still a sardine, but that's, that's incredibly high quality protein.

[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.940]   So we have so much there with just eating this way
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.560]   may in fact reduce this epidemic of Alzheimer's.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.580]   How old are you, Josh?
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.900]   You're like similar to my age, right?
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:29.600]   No, I'm 34.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.320]   34, so you're younger.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.220]   So maybe you don't remember this.
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.220]   I'm almost 50.
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.220]   When I was a kid, like there was one old person that was crazy.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:38.040]   That's what we called it back then.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.180]   We didn't even understand what it was.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.740]   We said they had dementia.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.380]   They were crazy.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.760]   We didn't really call it Alzheimer's yet.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.700]   And it would be like there's 100 old people.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.860]   There's like one or two that had lost their faculties.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.080]   Now it seems like every time you call it Alzheimer's,
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:50.080]   it's like there's 100 old people that had lost their faculties.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:34:20.100]  , and then you're like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what it is.

[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:36.720]  hower: Yes. And that's what we're all about. And that's our tagline. We have the worst tagline ever, but it says what it is and does what it does, and that is "Helping you live a better life if times get tougher, even if they don't." And that's what we're all about. You can check us out, and everything else I do, you can find from there. And if you want to know what I'm doing with keto, again, it's called Jack's Low Carb Journey. It's the playlist. And you can either find it for everybody, or I can send you a link, Josh. There is the one out of those 40-odd videos now that is, you know, one of the best videos that I've done.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   Josh:

[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:11.680]   make it the way the recipe is and then decide if you want to throw walnuts in it. Right?
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.180]   So it's that same type of thinking. Start with something like that.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:18.180]   And you know, if anybody has any questions for me, you know, they can ask if you have like,
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:22.880]   you know, blog notes or whatever in and I'll be happy to kind of come by and answer those
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.380]   or they can get in touch with me directly.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.680]   Absolutely. And Jack's Low Carb Journey is all on YouTube.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.480]   So just go to YouTube.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.180]   It's all on YouTube.
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:32.180]   Jack, thank you for coming on. And I want to close it just with one closing note.
