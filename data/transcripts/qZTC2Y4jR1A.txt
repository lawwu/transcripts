[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is In-Depth, a semi-regular series in which I talk to interesting people
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.740]   about the quest to cultivate a deep life.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.100]   I'm excited about today's guest.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.400]   It's my longtime friend, David DeWayne.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.900]   Now, if you've read Deep Work, you might recognize this name.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.200]   David, who is an architect, is featured in that book for his idea of what he called the
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.880]   Eudaimonia Machine, a design for a theoretical office that maximizes deep work over distraction.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.540]   So after my book came out, this idea, this design of the Eudaimonia Machine became a bit
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.360]   of a sensation.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.820]   As David talks about in our interview, he got a lot of press about it.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.080]   Eventually, someone even built a version of his Eudaimonia Machine, so it had a life of
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.520]   its own.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.960]   Since then, David has gone on to make these type of buildings a reality.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.740]   He works with a cutting-edge firm that tries to design the offices of the future for knowledge
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.940]   work.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.820]   So keep it in mind, not just the physical spaces, but how they interact with how people think
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.420]   and distractions.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.520]   Probably one of the most creative thinkers out there about the interaction of space and the
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.380]   ability to do things with your mind.
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.540]   So we talk about this in my interview.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.660]   We get into it, this sort of interaction between offices and spaces from a massive office to how
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.760]   you design your home office to be more conducive to deep work.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.640]   But the other reason why I have David on the show is that among the people I know, few spend
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.660]   as much time as he does systematically thinking about what he wants in his life and how to make
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.300]   his life deeper.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.940]   He is very good at life engineering and engineering his life towards depth.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.940]   So we get into that journey as well.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.840]   In this interview, we talk about his current life right now, which is really cool the way
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.220]   he has it set up and how he got there, including key turning points and the specific tools he
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.600]   used and has invented to help make his life better.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.960]   Keep a particular eye out for our discussion of the Collins score, which is something I learned
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.500]   from him and he uses to great effect in his life.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.500]   So anyways, if you're interested in either more focus in your current spaces or more depth
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.220]   in your life going forward, I think you're going to love this wide ranging conversation
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.520]   that I had with David DeWayne.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.840]   But before we get into it, I want to mention our presenting sponsor who is making it possible
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.180]   for us to present this interview with no commercial interruptions.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.240]   And that is our friends at done daily.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.860]   Done daily helps you break free from the noise of shallow tasks and focus on the deep, meaningful
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.080]   work that really matters.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.300]   Now, I know the people who created done daily.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.840]   They were behind another company called my body tutor, which has been a longtime sponsor of
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.480]   the podcast.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.020]   They're experts at online coaching.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.680]   So having real people coach you, but using the internet to try to keep things affordable.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.860]   And that's what they're bringing to the world of productivity with done daily.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.180]   You're assigned a coach to work with, but this coach is going to work with a proven productivity
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.800]   system.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.380]   So they will help you build a quarterly plan, lay out your weekly plan, and then organize a
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.780]   daily plan to stay on top of what matters most.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.700]   You check in on your plan daily with them for accountability and then debrief on your plan
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.320]   every week to see how things are going.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.580]   I don't work for this company, but they, they know my ideas.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.880]   And a lot of the type of ideas I talk about on the show, like multi-scale planning are
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.420]   integrated into their system.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.500]   And I was happy for them to do that because I I've known them for a long time.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.740]   And I think it's really cool to bring the idea of online coaching to the types of productivity
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.360]   ideas we talk about here.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.540]   I think that's probably the future, especially for very high performers is to have a coach
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.540]   on board and online coaching is much more affordable than trying to have like an executive
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.940]   coach actually show up at your office.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.420]   So anyways, um, I thought this was a cool company.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.600]   I've known these guys.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.220]   I said, look, I want to tell people about it.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.220]   So, uh, done daily, just go to done daily.com D O U N E daily.com to find out more.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.800]   All right.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.920]   With that, let's get into our interview with David Dwayne.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.200]   All right.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.160]   I'm here with David Dwayne.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.380]   David, I think you're best known to my audience.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.580]   As I mentioned in the introduction for your idea of the eudaimonia machine, which was in
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.940]   my book, deep work.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.820]   Now my memory is correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.400]   That began as a architect sketch.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.000]   You literally sketch this no cliche on a napkin at a bar at a bar.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.980]   What's the backstory?
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:31.620]   So the backstory is that, you know, I found out about your stuff at between so good.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.900]   They can't ignore you and deep work.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.360]   And if I remember right, you're blogging chapters out to deep work, right?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.920]   Or like you were, you were talking about the concept in some way, shape or form.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.800]   I used to use the term hard focus.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.780]   And then at some point I evolved that over to the word deep work.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.580]   So a mutual friend of ours, Brian Chappelle was deep working to accelerate his dissertation.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.700]   And he turned me on to the concept of deep work because I was teaching architecture at
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.720]   the time and I was trying to accelerate my paper output.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   And so Brian and I were just having lunch one day and he's like, well, you're architect.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.100]   Like, well, it'd be the ultimate space for deep working, you know, because we were each doing
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.940]   all these workarounds.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.820]   Like, I don't know if I described this to you before, but I actually had to get an office
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.460]   in a different school on campus so that I could focus.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.800]   Like, I got an office in the religious studies department, even though it had nothing to do
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.940]   with me and nobody knew who I was.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.780]   Just to get away from distraction.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.380]   Exactly.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.280]   And Brian was writing his dissertation in his basement, right?
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.840]   And he had that like super regimented 5 a.m.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.720]   4 a.m.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.320]   4 a.m.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.100]   Something crazy, yeah.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.280]   And so we were, we were kind of in like a little bit of a support loop.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.120]   And then I just sketched it out at lunch and he had the idea.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.800]   I think he emailed you without even telling me.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.600]   And then you replied and you're like, yeah, let's get together and talk about.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:58.960]   And I remember like really distinctly taking this seriously and being like, okay, here is,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.220]   here's like a description of how this should work, you know, and I put it on one page and
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.680]   sent it to you.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.960]   And that was like, it was very impactful in my, in my whole vector since then.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.680]   I mean, it showed up in a lot of places.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   It would come up in magazines or I would see it and you referenced like, I don't know that
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.420]   world well, but it seems like it had a bit of a half-life.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.100]   It had a little cult following there.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.320]   Somebody built a version of it in Chelsea in New York.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.740]   I didn't realize this.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.940]   Okay.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.460]   In Chelsea.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.840]   Okay.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.860]   Full size?
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.140]   No.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.120]   It was like a store.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.240]   It was like a retail store, but it was, that's what I remember.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.960]   Reorganized.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.800]   Like it was organized along these lines.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.040]   And then, um, yeah, it was there that, you know, a couple of people, like Seth Godin
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.920]   was there, a chip cutter from the wall street journal was there.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.000]   And that was the consequential one.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.740]   Cause he wrote up in the future of, uh, work, the wall street journal does this every year.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.420]   They have their future work kind of section.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.000]   And that's where my current CEO read about it.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.340]   And he's like, boom, here's my guy.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.660]   So you would say now, I think this is what's interesting is back then it was a sketch you
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.500]   were teaching architecture.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.800]   Now your day job in some sense is making these types of spaces a reality.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.840]   Do I have that more or less right?
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.760]   Yes.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.320]   So I'm an architect, uh, and the, uh, the chief experience officer of a company called
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.640]   Genient.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:25.460]   And what we do is, uh, we try to build workplaces that help people, um, have great experiences
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.540]   and do their jobs better.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.820]   You know, I would like the whole project grew out of, I think your, your critique was that
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.760]   the whole world of work is in a, in a way suffering.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.860]   Cause we're so distracted all the time.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.900]   I was looking at it purely from the slice of the experience of the physical space architect
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.560]   and thinking like the space is damaged in the, um, or the space is faulty or whatever lacking.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.200]   And there are other people looking at it from like the technology standpoint.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.340]   And so now like where I'm, I'm privileged to be in a position where like, that's my job
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.820]   is to try to figure out how to enable companies to take a totally different approach.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.840]   I can totally elevate it evolved approach and it, it keys together.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.340]   Like it reinforces in a ton of ways your, your whole gestalt, you know, a question I'm
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.620]   often asked is people who are doing a lot of remote work.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.740]   So they're setting up their own space at home.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.720]   They're wondering, okay, if I wanted to get, take advantage of my physical space, have
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.520]   something like the eudaimonia machine type of advantage, but it's not an office for a lot
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:29.920]   of people.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.760]   It's how I think about the physical spaces when I work, when I'm at my own home.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.520]   Have you thought about this?
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.380]   Like if you really wanted to go, not radical, but you really wanted to get into it with someone
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.380]   who was working from home into changing the various spaces you work in, having multiple spaces,
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.240]   what's possible here?
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.300]   Okay.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.620]   So I think about this every day, you know, I think about it a lot.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:09:01.740]   Um, I think that we've become so used to languishing, you know, flourishing is the highest state of
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.400]   wellbeing.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.060]   Depression is the opposite.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.920]   Linguishing is the middle.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.540]   I'm just getting by, you know?
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:15.880]   And I think that the open office kind of just generic world out there is largely about
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.240]   languishing.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.020]   And so when you compare that to my house, I like, where would I rather languish in my
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.560]   house or here?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.840]   It's just easier to languish at home.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.720]   I don't think a lot of people are flourishing at home because I think in order to flourish,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.660]   you have to be exposed to other people.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.800]   You have to give resources.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.720]   You have to like, you have to, or for a lot of knowledge workers, I think you really need
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.860]   to engage in some sort of reciprocal, like energizing dialogue.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.260]   And zoom is a poor proxy for this.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.220]   The reason I'm sitting in the HQ right now, talking to you in person is because if this
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.260]   was on zoom, I don't think the conversation quality would be as good.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.560]   So where you're going here is actually the key is to making the non-home office better.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.900]   that will prefer remote work.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.580]   If all we're doing at the office is we're in a cubicle on email and like, I might as well
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.600]   be at home because I don't have to commute and I have other, I can go to do my Peloton over
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.100]   lunch.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.020]   If you want to make something remarkable with other people, I think you have to do it in
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:26.840]   an environment that is set up in such a way that stimulates that kind of creativity, you
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.280]   know, and that kind of, that's, that triggers our kinds of relationships.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.780]   So this is the whole switch from functional to performative, you know, like if there's one
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.180]   kind of just switch I want to flip in your head, is that like, and I'm stealing this from
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.600]   Rem Kulass, the greatest living architect, probably a Dutch guy.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:51.180]   Is that like almost anything can function as a, let's say a school, a trailer can function
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.300]   as a school, right?
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.900]   If you're a school is too crowded, you can put people outside, but like what performs as a
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.160]   school, you know, what, what, what gets those students in the right mindset?
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.980]   What like connects you to like history?
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.220]   This is like the Georgetown campus with its, it's, it's ornate buildings and the greens with
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.640]   the old trees.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.280]   They don't need it.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.940]   Georgetown could function on any, in, in a commercial office building downtown.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.080]   You could put every single student, every single professor in a tower downtown and they
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.380]   could function.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.100]   But like, what, if you want to get, break into that next tier, it's about performance, you
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.020]   know, and like what performs as a workplace, you know, what gets us in the right state of
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.160]   mind, what puts us in the right kind of relationship.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.100]   And that is, it's a tricky thing.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.240]   Like a great experience is a tricky thing to build.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.000]   It's like a spell.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.720]   Like, uh, like you, you kind of conjure it.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.940]   It's like a bubble or something and it's easy to break it.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.980]   It's got like concentration.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.720]   Like as soon as your phone buzzes or somebody taps you on the shoulder.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.780]   Go on.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.580]   Here's a, okay.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.200]   So here's a followup going on a rabbit hole here, but it's a fascinating one to me.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.360]   Does this make sense to you by the way?
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.240]   It absolutely does.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.400]   So my followup is I had this idea I wrote about in the early days of virtual reality where
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.440]   I had done the first demos.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.220]   One of my students had brought an early vibe to Georgetown and I wrote this article on what
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.640]   I called immersive single tasking.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.000]   And my idea was because of exactly this theory you're talking about, I said space matters.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.480]   I was thinking about Cambridge, think about Oxford.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.720]   I mean, space matters, the, the symmetry of those greens, the, the fireplace and the wood
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.020]   panel offices for, you know, CS Lewis is in there.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.480]   It matters for certain creative production.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.900]   That's like the Seinfeld thing about space, you know, it's cataclysmically relevant.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.420]   You remember that?
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.020]   So I was saying, okay, so at home, I was like, maybe something virtual reality is going to
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.460]   bring to us is workspaces that are inspiring in that way that you're single.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.120]   I call it immersive single tasking because you'd be working on a single thing.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.840]   And I think my example was, you know, you're in the Hogwarts dining hall, which is based
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.580]   off King's college or whatever with a whiteboard you can draw on with like the virtual reality
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.340]   and you're working on a proof there is going to be a completely different mindset than
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.220]   at your kitchen table.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.160]   And people built these things, right?
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.780]   I mean, I said, okay, here's the limitations.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.620]   It was resolution.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.720]   I'm like, you need a good enough resolution that you can actually read and see text and
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.200]   be able to write.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.700]   And people have built these things.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.400]   It really has not caught on.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.220]   So is this just, we're not there yet?
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.060]   Or is there something about the physicality?
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.520]   So I think we're not there yet.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:13.980]   Okay.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:20.400]   I, I will, my, I was totally blown away when I did my first demo of the vision pro, the
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.000]   apple vision pro.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.020]   I'm like, oh my God, you know, um, there's a, have you done it?
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.980]   Uh, I haven't done the vision pro though.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.700]   I've done other AR.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:29.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   I mean, you know, it makes it, it makes it, it makes old ARs to me, in my view, look like,
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.240]   uh, toys.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.860]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.200]   You know, and what'd you do in it?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.100]   Okay.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.760]   So there's a couple of simulations that you walk through, which are kind of like, okay.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.780]   And then there's this whole deep experience they do at the end where they're like, basically
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:56.620]   play like a reel of like, um, uh, it starts like it fades out of black and like Alicia keys
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.540]   is standing from media away, like singing to you, you know?
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.020]   And it was so shocking to me that I made the guy play like three times, but this is just
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.560]   like a virtual reality demo at this point.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.660]   This is what the past two completely turned off and now it's in virtual reality.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.080]   Well, what's weird about the vision pro too, is that your peripheral vision is intact.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.940]   So you can kind of look to the side and see real world stuff.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.760]   But then there's like, it takes you to like a, you know, Greek, um, ruins in Turkey.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   And then it takes you to like little kids playing soccer in Nairobi or something.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.000]   And I've been to Greek ruins in Turkey and I've seen little kids play soccer in Africa.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.580]   And that's exactly what it feels like.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.020]   It, you don't have the dusty bus ride to get you there, but it's like 80, 90% of the
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.220]   way.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:43.260]   So like immediately after I had that demo, I emailed a guy I know who runs like a software
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.120]   company for architects.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.700]   And I'm like, you got to do captures of like all the great buildings in the world and
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.640]   sell them to architecture schools.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:56.760]   You know, because like now you don't have to go to, you know, uh, the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:04.140]   Like you could get most of it, you know, uh, just like sitting in your couch in your living
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.580]   room or something.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.180]   Now, why hasn't it caught on yet?
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.960]   And like the sports stuff is actually awesome too.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.000]   Like you'd really appreciate the baseball one where you're sitting on like the first baseline.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.300]   I did, uh, I did one recently of the SNL 50th anniversary show.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.320]   They put a 3d, uh, 360 degree camera and you could sit next to the cameraman while they were
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.160]   doing one of the skits.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.980]   And like, they were here and you can look over and the cameraman was right there and
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.480]   you can look behind you and the audience.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.520]   But do you buy this?
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.840]   My, my argument has been the way into this world is what I've observed reporting on it
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.740]   is going to be screens.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.440]   So the number one productivity app in the Oculus store during the pandemic was this company
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.260]   called immersed.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.340]   And what they found was everyone else was trying to jump straight into a full virtual experience.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.620]   Typically with like group meetings, we'll all meet at the ruins of whatever.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.360]   And it was friction was the problem.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.020]   People like, I don't want to go through that.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.200]   I don't want to put on my thing and log into a room.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.420]   And like, I could just do zoom on the computer I'm already at.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.640]   So what immersed did is they said, you know, you're in a virtual world, but here's what you
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.100]   care about.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.260]   We give you monitors.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.960]   And at, at home, you only own one extra monitor, but in the virtual world, we give
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.400]   you four.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.500]   And so it's like a more useful workspace, right?
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.480]   You have more monitors.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.880]   So I'm working from home and I can have three big monitors because I don't own three big
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.620]   monitors, but they're virtual, but you're surrounded by, you're on top of a mountain or this or that.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.280]   And they found this got people into the virtual world because it was convenient.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.620]   It's a better screen than they physically have at home.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.640]   But then they were in a virtual world and then other things could happen.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.520]   My personal test for these kinds of things is when you forget and you're, there's like
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.600]   a slip in your mind and you forget that you're in a Apple store or whatever.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.960]   And you think you're in Turkey, you know?
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:52.180]   And I guess it'll be exciting when that's readily available to everybody.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.340]   But man, the, the bar is so high for making all that content and stuff.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:04.020]   And it's, it's, it's the adoption is got to really be agonizing for Apple and the companies
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.440]   that are invested in this because, you know, no, you haven't even tried it.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:14.000]   The, when I think about these things instead, when I think about great experiences, you know,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.920]   I am like maybe oddly satisfied with the real world, you know?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.760]   And, uh, like my favorite digital experience is the Apple pay.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.800]   I didn't ask for it.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.920]   It's invisible.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.880]   It was free.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.520]   It just showed up one day and it makes my life easier, you know?
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.160]   So I don't have to think about extra stuff.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.780]   I can focus more on, you know, uh, what I care about that day.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.940]   Like what I set out to do that day.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.460]   Did you read, um, Rick Rubin's creativity book?
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.580]   Some of it.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.020]   It's not a book you really read through.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.920]   He modeled it on the Tao Te Ching kind of, so you can kind of pick it up and put it down
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.460]   wherever you want.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.880]   But there's one part in there that I thought you'd like a lot where he, he encourages you
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.280]   to plan your day with a concentration that you're like landing an airplane, you know?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.540]   And so like, yeah, the first 15 minutes of my day when I'm like time blocking and stuff
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.140]   and going through like my kind of core daily metrics, it like, I have it written right next
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.080]   to it in my planner.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.740]   Like take the same seriousness to those 15 minutes as though you're landing an airplane.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.540]   What does that mean?
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.040]   What does it mean to be serious about planning?
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:30.660]   Um, be really, uh, focused on like the two or three really important, like for me in the,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.480]   my rhythm and my daily life right now, I can probably achieve two or three really important
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.000]   things in a day, you know?
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:44.480]   And so I just need to, and I, I like carefully segment creative time out from normal time,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.620]   a shallow work time.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:52.360]   And so I really carefully budget because if you don't do it, the world just sweeps in and
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.280]   steals your time.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.800]   I'll tell you something interesting about it.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   Cause I was just writing about exactly this idea this morning.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:05.480]   So I'm working on a chapter in my new book and it's about organizing your time as a prerequisite
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.560]   for changing your life.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.060]   And I was writing about exactly this idea and I was looking back historically, where did
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:16.700]   this idea of MIT's most important tasks, like make sure that you figured out the most important
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.220]   thing and get that done first.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.500]   Right.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.880]   It seems like a timeless idea.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.800]   It arose early two thousands.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.960]   Right.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.500]   So there's just that phrase, that phrase, but not just that phrase, that phrase came a little
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:27.980]   bit later.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:33.560]   I think that was, uh, Gina Tapani at life hacker invented MIT's, but it was, you had Brian Tracy
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.900]   eat that frog was sort of getting around that idea.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.600]   If you eat the frog, eat a frog first thing in the day, everything else won't seem so bad.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.260]   And his, his idea was do your most important thing first.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.560]   Then Julie Morgenstern in the early two thousands wrote, never check your email in the morning.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.320]   And her idea was before you do anything else, spend one hour on the most important thing
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.880]   because you're going to, you're not going to get to it.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.020]   And then the bloggers took over Leo Babuda.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.060]   That's where I first came across it as his inhabitants.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.220]   And then I wrote about it.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.000]   This, by the way, is like one of the issues I'm having now when I'm using AI asking about
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.160]   the origins of different productivity ideas, my articles keep coming back.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.560]   So it's become oddly circular.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.160]   I wrote about this back then, but this idea emerged sort of concurrently with email culture.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.540]   And I wonder if it wasn't as relevant in 1992.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.200]   It was, I have time.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.600]   I have two meetings today.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.200]   And my problem is like filling my day, but you get to the early two thousands.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.520]   We introduced this idea of make sure that you do the thing that matters first,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.680]   because that might be your only chance to get to it.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.620]   Yeah, no, I could see that.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.880]   I like, I like Ferris's kind of idea of make before you manage.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:53.400]   I just think that, yeah, the, the, the, the sort of situation I've carved out for myself
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:59.640]   is that I have the, I have decent amount of control over my time, especially like I know
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.940]   the hours of the day where I'm pretty productive and I try to really focus on taking things off
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.340]   my master task list, like, I don't have to go looking for stuff to do.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.100]   It's all there.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.980]   Like I've captured it or configured it or whatever.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.820]   And, uh, like I kind of tee it up and I go for it.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:21.380]   Um, but man, I look at other, like, cause people share their calendars and stuff, you know?
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.280]   And I mean, you, you, you're done now.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.520]   You, you get a lot of communication, like you're, you're in it, right?
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.900]   Like there's emails, there's meetings all the time or whatever.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.200]   But I have to, I look at other people's calendars and this is jammed all the way.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.440]   And I'm like, man, how do you get anything done?
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.200]   You know?
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.020]   Um, but how do you resist that?
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:53.280]   Um, I try to not, I personally tried to just focus on doing fewer things, but doing them
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.440]   well.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:22:01.240]   And I try not to, I, uh, I try not to show up or like volunteer to show up to meetings
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.220]   where I'm not contributing.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.800]   Um, unless there's something like there's, there's a series of meetings that are within my company
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.060]   that I'm not participating.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.300]   Other people are like presenting forecasts and stuff like that, that I love because I can
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.780]   feel like the pulse of the company and stuff.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:21.080]   But, um, I just, I don't have a lot of meetings that aren't mission critical and most of my
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.580]   meetings are external to like with, you know, um, people that control workplaces for other
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.600]   companies that I'm trying to sell my services to.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:38.320]   So, uh, you don't like, I think the, the biggest thing that helped me have a under scheduled
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:48.380]   calendar is just like, just killing the pseudo productivity dragon and be like, don't like,
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:53.280]   don't assume that you're more valuable to the company because your calendar is full.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.060]   Yeah, I just met last weekend.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.800]   He just retired, but he was a president of a relatively large company and had been for
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.860]   most of his professional career.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.900]   And the story he told me is he said, look, my calendar was filled because of exactly what
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.260]   you're saying.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.660]   This is what makes me useful is people want to talk to me and I can talk to them and give
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.440]   them guidance or help them make decisions.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.080]   This is why I'm useful.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.800]   Then he hired a new CFO and a really high level executive assistant.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.120]   And they, they kind of put their heads together and came back and said, you have too many
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.920]   meetings and here's what we're going to do.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.580]   We're going to block off a non-trivial amount of time every day.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.940]   And the executive assistant is like, I'm going to protect that.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.660]   Like you're at your daughter's wedding.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.920]   So this is time that I'm not going to, we're not going to let meetings go into.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.540]   And he's really worried.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.880]   Like, but that's like three or four meetings.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.660]   And he said, after that change, it was, you know, night and day, he felt like he was five
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.400]   X more useful, not productive, but useful.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.640]   He had time to sit and think and strategize.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.280]   And it turned out that there was this back pressure in meetings that would fill every minute.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.180]   Anyway, there's no, you know, into it.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:55.340]   Right.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.240]   So it's not like those three extra meetings was the difference between success or not.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.540]   And then the story I told back, I tell this in a world without email is that, uh, general
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:10.080]   Marshall, chief of staff of the army during world war two, that the, the, uh, person in
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.560]   charge of the entire war effort, essentially right back here in DC didn't work past five
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.840]   during world war two because he had a heart condition.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.920]   And like back then the doctor's advice was don't work past five.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.720]   So you don't have a heart attack.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.420]   So he ran world war two fixed schedule.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.760]   Not where it was fixed schedule.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.160]   He had to get congressional approval that completely changed the lines of communication within the
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.680]   war department.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.940]   So there's too many people reporting to me.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.560]   Here's what we're going to do.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.280]   I'm going to talk to these five people and then these people will handle these people.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.700]   And if you're going to have a meeting with me, you're going to bring all of this stuff
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.180]   in advance.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.360]   That meeting is going to be 10 minutes.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.960]   And most of this stuff I'm not going to do anymore.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.960]   And it turned out it was all a knob you could turn and you could turn that knob to fill
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.820]   every minute of your day.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.400]   You could turn the knob to work till five.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.460]   And he was just as effective.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.680]   There was just a element of intentionality.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.720]   I mean, you sort of just have me now on a workflow tangent.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.940]   I still want to get to the main thing I want to talk to you about, but all right.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.120]   So the main thing I want to talk to you about is I do think about you as someone who's very
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.160]   intentional about your life.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.240]   Thank you.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.720]   And I, I want to break down some of the things you've done to get there because I think it's
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   useful for my listeners who care about the deep life, but I want to paint the picture
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.180]   a little bit more.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.040]   We've talked about your job.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.720]   We know you're an architect.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.840]   Now you have this job where you're helping to design sort of the workspace of the future.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.920]   That's like a Disney Epcot term, but you know.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.160]   Right.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.720]   But you also have, tell us about the farm.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.380]   Epcot was pretty radical, by the way.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.940]   Okay.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.200]   So yeah.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:37.400]   One of the things that I feel happy about in this conversation is that I do kind of feel
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.460]   like a representative of the audience.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.860]   Like I'm not a famous person.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.360]   Nobody, like, I don't have a, I'm not an author of some other book that's coming here to kind
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.100]   of do that.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:52.900]   Like I, and I'll give you your flowers just once really quickly that I attribute a lot
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:58.960]   of the things that make me a kind of, um, an intentional person to the fact that I've
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.340]   like, I've taken a lot of your lessons really seriously and applied them over a long period
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.540]   of time, like a decade.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.120]   This is why I'm having you on.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.080]   We want to hear that story.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:08.720]   Right.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.440]   So, um, so where do you want to start at the farm right now?
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.100]   Tell me, yeah.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.220]   Tell us about the farm.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.760]   Okay.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.140]   Like where you, you live normally in the farm and then I, and then I'm going to wind you
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.240]   back to like how we ended up there.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.160]   So I'm from a small town in Wisconsin and, uh, but I live in Chicago and my wife and
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.600]   I are from the same small town and we decided during COVID that, you know, and we'd been
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   thinking about it for like a while, but we wanted a country spot that is a kind of a compliment
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.240]   to our city spot.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.380]   Cause our jobs depend on being in the city.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.360]   And so, and your city spot's really a city spot, row house.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.400]   Like, you know, all the people, you know, I live in a great neighborhood, right close to
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.160]   university, Hyde park, South side of Chicago.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.280]   It's kind of like Tacoma park or Georgetown.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.360]   Um, but yeah, it's great.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.240]   And it's like a working class neighborhood.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:07.660]   And, um, but we found, uh, we, we, we were looking and looking for like a country spot and
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.880]   we finally found a, a really interesting one.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:16.260]   Um, that is like five acres right in Lake Michigan, you know, like, uh, 10 minutes outside my hometown.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.240]   And so an orchard nonetheless.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.280]   No, it didn't have an orchard.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.060]   Oh, you planted that.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:21.580]   All right.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.140]   So it was just five acres when you got it.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:27.680]   So we, um, yeah, we, we bought it and it wasn't expensive.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.420]   It was like, I think we paid 170 grand.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.780]   Cause the house was, it was an old barn from the 1870s.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.200]   And then it had a two car garage attached to it.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.580]   And so we converted the car, the garage into a thing, but we had to put in a well, we had
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.040]   to put in gas, we had to put electric and those weren't bugs for me.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.700]   Those were features.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.440]   Cause I got like, we got to design everything.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.780]   I like building stuff.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.400]   And so it was cheaper.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.320]   Like I could never have afforded to hire a contract to do all that stuff.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.900]   And so, um.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.720]   And how far is it from your house in Chicago?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.500]   Two and a half hours.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.460]   So we can migrate there on the weekends and stuff.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.900]   And the pragmatically, the way that we did it is that we will like, well, Airbnb it when
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.360]   we're not there.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.960]   And, um, that worked out perfectly.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.420]   You know, we kind of have a push down pop-up system where if there's a big event in Chicago,
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.260]   we can Airbnb our place in Chicago and go to the farm and it works out.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:23.760]   So like, we're not rich people, you know, very middle, middle income folks.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:31.440]   And, um, like, but we really wanted this to work and we came up with like an imminently
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.880]   practical solution.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.660]   But now it's like, uh, every, like I joke around like with you probably, but like every day I'm
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.280]   there is a plus two.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.820]   You know, every day I'm working there for sure is a plus two.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.500]   Well, you have, you have the writing and stuff.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.160]   What do you call it now?
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.800]   The writing, my writing cottage, yeah.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.380]   Or I love this part of it.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:02.900]   So, um, I, we have three little kids and, um, it's a lot of noise.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.120]   And when I'm there, you know, sometimes you want to get away from that.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.100]   So I copied Mark Twain's writer's cottage and like other people have had these, you know,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:15.100]   like we've probably jumped around about, uh, project Douglas had one, you know, these other
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:15.620]   writers have them.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.880]   And so, and I, I do like writing.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.500]   I'm working on a book project that I will get to, uh, at some point here.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.500]   I think the writer's cottage, like building a writer's cottage was the ultimate act of procrastination
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.240]   on this book project.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.680]   Uh, but, well, the, the ultimate move is what Michael Pollan did where he wrote a book
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.960]   about writing, building his writer's cottage.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.360]   That's the meta move right there.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.420]   Touche.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:41.600]   Um, so anyway, no, it's a, it's like a octagon building about the size of this room and
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.920]   it sits in the field, like beyond the orchard, looks right.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.400]   Lake Michigan.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.820]   And it is like my favorite place in the world, you know?
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:59.400]   And I, it costs $2,000 in materials from Lowe's and you built Craig's list.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.660]   You know, it's, it's not like these things are not, but it took a lot of time.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.980]   It took a lot of hours.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.640]   But again, that's a feature, you know, it was fun to build.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.980]   Your schedule is like most weekends, most weekends you would head out there.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.260]   And then sometimes if there was something going on in Chicago, you would bail Airbnb and go
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:16.720]   out there longer.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.900]   And we just got comfortable Airbnb in our house too.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.600]   You know, so I was like, yeah, a lot of people kind of raise their eyebrows at that, but Hey
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.180]   man, whatever like makes it possible, you know?
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.000]   And it's really great for the kids.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.060]   It's, it's like my life is this really beautiful kind of two alternating currents where
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.080]   on Friday I can get out of the city.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.680]   I have a couple afternoon calls that I can take on the road and then I pull up to the
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:43.880]   farm.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:51.480]   It's like I get out and it's just quiet and you know, I can notice little changes in the
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:51.860]   landscape.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:58.300]   Like I'm so attuned to that landscape now that day to day, especially in spring, it's like
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.900]   I can see things changing and that's really exciting to me.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:09.520]   And then like Sunday evening, I, you know, pack up, go back to Chicago and I turn by 94
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:09.960]   or whatever.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.020]   And I see the skyline and I feel like seven feet tall.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.100]   And I'm like, all right, let's get back into this, you know?
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.880]   And it's so, it's such a great way to live at least at this stage in my life.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.280]   But there's one other thing in the, in my drawer at the writer's cottage.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:34.580]   I don't know if I told you about this, but I hacked your time block planner and I have my
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.260]   own like a version of it, but I built a life time block planner.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.220]   So you mean like on a year scale?
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.680]   Yes.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.180]   Ooh.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.880]   So it goes a hundred, it goes from now till I'm a hundred years old and each spreads like
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.240]   a year.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.500]   And so there are projects that I have that I know I don't have the bandwidth to work on
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.520]   them now, but I don't want them rattling around in my head.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:00.900]   So I put them in my life block planner years out, you know, and you look at it and I look
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.440]   at it all the time.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:01.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:02.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:09.980]   Well, from a lifestyle centric planning perspective, what was, so the farm is a solution to a vision
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.940]   that, because we talk about this a lot on the show that in lifestyle strict planning, you're,
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.360]   you're, you don't work towards a particular, you don't start with the goal.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.180]   Like I want to buy something here.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.560]   You start with the vision of the lifestyle.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.300]   Like, here's what I want in my life that we don't have.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.480]   And then you look for creative solutions that gets that there.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:31.260]   So what was, what was the goal that eventually the farm became the solution to?
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.860]   I think just like, what were you, what were you thinking when envisioning your lifestyle?
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.440]   This is what's missing.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   I think it's just the pace, you know, like years go by like that, you know?
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:55.280]   And I think that there was something else about like returning to our, like our roots, you
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.920]   know, like, cause your hometown was nearby.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.020]   Well, not just that.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.480]   Like my hometown was nearby.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.960]   My parents are kind of aging and they're there.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.100]   Um, I want my kids to have a relationship with them, but I was, I was, you know, tucking
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.540]   my middle kid in when we were at the farm one day and I was telling her, I'm like, you know,
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.280]   when our people immigrated here, they came right to this County.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.620]   And she's like, what really do we have a photograph?
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.640]   And it's like right after the civil war, potato famine, Irish people.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.460]   And I'm like, yeah, we got a picture.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.960]   And she's like, I want to go put a picture on the guy's grave tomorrow.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.180]   And so we found the picture, made a copy of it, put it in a little frame.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.240]   It took it out to the cemetery and found the guy's grave.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.280]   And so your relatives, there's a cemetery nearby that has like your relatives are there.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   The first guy from Ireland.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.480]   Huh?
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.500]   So he's born temporary.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.760]   Now there he is.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.180]   You know?
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.860]   And so every successive generation has kind of come up there.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:49.160]   And so, I mean, that's different than when you're in Chicago and it's kind of like anonymous
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.520]   in a way you're absorbed into this larger thing.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.100]   So what, like what, when you, when you first were thinking about those general goals, I
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.120]   want to slow things down.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.980]   I want some connection.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.000]   You're probably thinking generally like the country, have some part of our life that's
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.120]   slower back to our roots.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.960]   Was there, I'm imagining there.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.920]   I was like, okay, let's look at the obvious options.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.280]   Like the orchard was also a really big deal that you planted the orchard.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.620]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:10.940]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.040]   And their cider apples, their hard cider apple.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.520]   Was that part of the original plan?
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:19.060]   Well, so my wife and I, uh, she did it.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.060]   We lived in Paris briefly when she was doing a study abroad.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:29.640]   And, um, we, we discovered like in the French countryside, you know, like they have this
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.420]   like a Normandy has this champagne, like apple cider.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.440]   And we're like, Oh my God, we should make this.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.280]   How long ago was this?
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.500]   Uh, 2010.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.440]   So it had been lurking.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.120]   Oh yeah.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.340]   It'd been like a detail that became a part of your life.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.840]   It was like romantic.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.880]   You and your wife are bumming around rural France and you're like, we should get a country
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.780]   spot and plant an apple orchard.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.100]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:55.580]   You know, meanwhile, you're in DC, then you're in Chicago and you're buzzing around and you're
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.620]   getting jobs and getting promoted and all that stuff.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.200]   But then eventually it's like, we got to get serious.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:06.120]   And so we, as a kind of forcing mechanism, we used our 20th anniversary as like, that's,
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.620]   we're going to have a reunion or like a kind of a reunion of the people that came to our
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.860]   wedding, you know, and we're going to do it at this farm.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.540]   And we did.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.140]   We did.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:14.920]   I heard it was awesome.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.000]   Well, but when you first, so practically speaking, I'm assuming when you first like, okay, we
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.580]   have this deadline, we know we want country connection to roots orchard.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.400]   Probably the first thing you did was what?
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.840]   Well, fire up Zillow and you're looking at vacation homes for sale and it's like super expensive.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:37.020]   And that might be a place where we were even looking when we were here, you know, we looked
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.560]   at an orchard actually in like a, by Roanoke or something.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.260]   But like, yeah, like you, you look in a non-serious way for a while and then you kind of get more
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:47.920]   serious about it.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.940]   And COVID was sort of like, okay.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.040]   And then also it's like, shit, you know, we're running out of time.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.140]   What are we going to do?
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.020]   And so.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.440]   But you got, you got creative, right?
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.920]   Because a lot of people might've got stuck with like, okay, I'm looking up like nice houses
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.060]   on the lake and they're all $800,000 and I don't have $800,000.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.040]   So I guess that plan's not going to work, but you kept working.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.300]   We found it the day it came on.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.760]   And we put an offer in like a week later.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.800]   And also, I mean, like from the financial standpoint, I just traded my 401k for that.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.860]   Basically, I cashed my 401k early.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.640]   Absorbed all the penalties and stuff.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.560]   And it didn't really hurt my feelings too much because I want to work.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.500]   I love working.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.360]   So I want to work till I die anyway.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:26.740]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.320]   But it like, and plus I like, it's a good investment too, even though I didn't mean we
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.220]   don't want to sell it or anything, but, um, you're thinking about the next 20 years.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:44.120]   Like I had, I had to make a non-trivial choice about like, should I, should I risk this thing
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.040]   on that?
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.700]   And, uh, it's the best decision I ever made in my life.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.120]   I'm one of them, you know, you, I don't want anybody.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:57.560]   You're prioritizing the next 20 years, like making those, making those as good as possible
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.460]   as opposed to just maximizing 30 years or whatever, that period of life.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.280]   Um, tell me about the Collins score.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.500]   How do you use those?
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.680]   I threw out this thing that like every day at my farms, a plus two, you know, that was a
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.080]   subtle note.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.220]   We got a, we got a, I talked about it briefly on the show about a month ago, but it's,
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.740]   it's worth, bring, bring to the speed again.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.420]   Yep.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:26.300]   So, uh, about six years ago, uh, Ferris interviewed, Tim Ferris interviewed, uh, Jim Collins, the
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:30.180]   guy, the author of good to great and a handful of other like landmark books.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.480]   I consider him like the Peter Drucker of the 21st century.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.820]   I told you I got, I met him at some point after that.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.000]   He gave me some advice.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.420]   Nice guy.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.360]   He's a super, like, I just have to imagine how I got in touch with him.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.240]   He's hard to get in touch with.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.940]   Yeah, I know.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.760]   I have, uh, I'm not really a star chaser like that, you know?
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.080]   Uh, but I, if I, I look, I look forward someday to hopefully meeting him.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.040]   Um, we have a lot of things in common.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.920]   If you go to his website and you go to his further reading, he's like the only person I've
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.700]   ever met who's listened to more great courses series than I have, you know, so we can have
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.740]   a fun laugh about that.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.560]   But, um, he, he said something on, uh, you know, uh, Ferris's show that really stuck with
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.660]   me or caught my attention.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:14.120]   And then I implemented it right away, which is he, he tracks every day, three things.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.460]   He brings up a spreadsheet and he, he does a little bullet points of like the things that
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.000]   happened that day.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.980]   And then the second column, he records the amount of creative time, what he calls creative time.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.400]   You'd probably call it deep work.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.460]   She sent me high.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.840]   We'll call flow, whatever.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.100]   Uh, like heads down, focus work.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:37.820]   And then the third column is a rating, uh, like a daily rating, like a grade.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.020]   And it's highly subjective.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.140]   It's just a body feeling out of my day go.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.400]   And it's on this very specific scale, which I think is the, probably the, the most genius
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.080]   part of it, which is negative two, negative one, zero plus one, plus two.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.620]   So you have like zero is languishing, like a zero is literally languishing.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.580]   And I think like, well, I'll ask you, what do you think that score is actually measuring?
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.840]   Subjective assessment of your subjective field of the day.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.460]   Like, did you, like a zero to me, I think it's measuring Jim Collins, individual flourishing.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.320]   But like zero would be pretty consistent for people.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.940]   I would imagine zero is, I don't even really know what happened today.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.020]   It wasn't bad.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.180]   Like I wasn't sad.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.800]   I wasn't like stressed out, but like nothing also got me all that fired up.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.360]   I, you know, I had some emails, I had some meetings.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.460]   I think people's, if you're not paying attention, if you're not measuring this, I think that the
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.940]   default that hovers around zero.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.200]   Because if you're in the negative territory too long, you're probably going to want to make
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.440]   some changes.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.820]   But what you, people don't do is push themselves to the positive territory.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.120]   That's flourishing.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.580]   And so I started tracking.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.140]   How long, how long to set this up?
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.480]   How long?
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.300]   This is a while for you.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.280]   Right after I heard about it.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.080]   So six years ago.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.060]   And I started doing it with my mentor.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.800]   And like, so we would start out in our days, time blocking.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.600]   And then we would like text each other our, our schedule for the day.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   And then at the end of the day, we'd text each other a rating.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.420]   Okay.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.040]   And you used to call and scale.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.260]   And we used the con score.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.760]   Like that exact rating.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:12.880]   And so a couple of things occurred to me, like immediately, like one, or the first thing
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.920]   is that I knew what got me into negative territory.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.860]   Okay.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.500]   And I deleted that.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.020]   What was it?
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:25.740]   It's going to sound strange, but fighting with people, you know, like just beating people
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.320]   up on the street is stressful.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:33.040]   I grew up in a family of Jesuit lawyers and we would just fight for fun.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.680]   They can argue.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.700]   Jesuits can argue.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:35.920]   Everybody fights for fun.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   Uh, you know, and, but, uh, and I think I used to be more aggressive like that.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:47.560]   And then I just realized it was actually emotionally draining, you know, and family members or people
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.300]   you work with, work with.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.140]   Like be more confrontational about things like push on people and stuff, you know?
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.180]   And I just realized like, man, that's not helping.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:41:00.960]   And, uh, the other thing was, um, certain people kind of trigger, you know, if I was
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.120]   in like meetings too long or if I expected a certain kind of feedback from somebody and
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.980]   I wasn't getting it, like it would bring me down.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.440]   And so I just kind of avoid that.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.500]   There's like negative score people in your life.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   Kind of interesting.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:17.540]   And so, or like people that can kind of trigger negative score stuff if I asked them for the
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:17.960]   wrong thing.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.080]   Anyway, uh, so probably two or three other.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:29.140]   Oh, actually, I'll like, I'll tell you right now what triggers negative, which is I have
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.980]   very specific goals that I'm responsible for.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:37.420]   And if I look at where I spent my time that day, you know, look at my goals and they don't
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:37.740]   match.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.200]   That's a problem, you know, professionally.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:46.240]   Unless I had like a really good excuse, you know, like some, somebody came to me with a
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.060]   problem that was urgent and they turned to me and I addressed it in a fine way.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:57.780]   So like, uh, maybe that was like apart from my responsibilities, but I handled it and good,
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.960]   you know, so I'll give myself a, like a plus for that.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.540]   But the other thing that was actually probably more positive than eliminating the negatives
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:12.120]   was, you know, taking the things, uh, and like setting daily realistic goals.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.200]   Well, what could I do today to get to a plus one?
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.660]   What might I stretch to, to get to a plus two?
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.820]   You know, did you know what, you didn't know what those were, I'm assuming until you've been
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.240]   measuring.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.520]   Like, in other words, did you have to discover what works pretty consistently for a plus two
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:27.580]   day?
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.500]   You know how you feel at the end of that, you know?
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.440]   And, but like, did you discover something you wanted to prioritize before?
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:33.860]   Totally.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.920]   So like, what's, what, what's something you discovered that would reliably deliver like
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.980]   a plus one or plus two day manager, just manager expectations and then don't waste time.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.480]   Don't just like, don't allow time to just bleed away.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:53.740]   You know, like, I think it's like you, you, you, you, you contain the leaks and, and like
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:43:01.780]   you, you do get a sense of, um, it just a sense of accomplishment from like knocking that
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.240]   one thing.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.720]   Like I've become very, I try to be very particular about the things that make it onto my master
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.380]   task list, master task list.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.500]   But then aggressive about getting them off, you know, things that linger on that list,
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.740]   you know, these are like at the project scale.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.700]   At the project scale.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.200]   Exactly.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.080]   So, so, um, not wasting time for you means you made non-trivial progress.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:28.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:37.120]   And, and so, yeah, and I will, um, so my quarterly or my planner, my time block planner, I do it
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.480]   quarterly.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:43.760]   And so I set quarterly goals that I review basically every day, you know, because they
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.060]   don't take long to review.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:52.220]   And then I just make sure that the, the part that I'm actually struggling the most with is
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.660]   taking the time on Monday to really lay out the week.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:04.700]   I look, if I like review my old ones, those, those week spreads are, um, uh, under cooked.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.580]   I keep trying to convince myself to do this end of day Friday, which makes sense on paper,
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.240]   right?
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.620]   Because that's, it's actually the slowest part of the week and you have, and you get the
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.500]   benefit of the weekend of being like, I know what's going, but it's really hard.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.600]   It's like, you're done by Friday afternoon.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.340]   Like that, that, and, but the problem is Monday morning is everyone's rock and rolling and it's,
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.480]   it's difficult to take the 90 minutes.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.300]   It can take a while to really get your arms around things.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.240]   So I've been struggling with that too.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.720]   I think on paper, Friday, end of day makes all the sense in the world, but I psychologically,
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.080]   yeah, it's difficult.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.340]   Monday makes more sense, but it's hard to give it the time Monday morning.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.240]   It's an important link in the multi scale chain though.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.560]   You got to get that week in there because you can't just go from quarter to day.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.220]   Like I think that you, you, yeah, the week, the week really unlock, you can build a lot
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:54.940]   more momentum.
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.620]   I want to finish the conscore thing really quick is that I think actually like what I'm
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:05.400]   experimenting with at work right now is trying to promote this as a broader metric, not just
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.640]   within my company and my work, but like within the field of architecture, you know?
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.600]   And well, I've told you if people had to do this every day in a normal office job, you
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.040]   couldn't hide from the fact like we would have to burn down the building where they make
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:20.860]   Microsoft Outlook.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.080]   Like people are like, well, this is just, wait a second.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.000]   Oh my God.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.980]   What I'm doing in this job is making me miserable.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.440]   There's no metrics in knowledge work.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.380]   I call it the metric black hole, you know, in deep work.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.340]   It's like if people were actually measuring that, they'd be like, I am upset.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.000]   I did email and meetings all day.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.260]   That's not a plus one day.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:40.060]   So now I have access to within my company, I have access to real researchers, anthropologists
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.600]   and ethnographers and people with like masters and this stuff and PhDs in social
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:52.900]   sciences and like my, my personal background is in like high performance buildings from
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.900]   an energy and resource standpoint, like zero energy buildings, buildings that use very
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.440]   little water or have a little carbon footprint.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.980]   That was really easy and objective because those metrics are counted.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.480]   Here's how many volts you can build a model.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:05.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:11.360]   You know, but if you ask somebody build me a high performance workplace that makes my
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.780]   people happier, more productive, you can't look at a mechanical engineer and they're going
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.220]   to be totally worthless, you know, but you can ask a social scientist, you know, and they
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:20.960]   can give you some metrics.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.500]   But like, I think that this con score thing, like if you had, so this is what I'm, uh, I
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.180]   want to experiment with within my own office is get a series of my colleagues tracking.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.060]   Okay.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.460]   And we have some underutilized parts of our office, like a couple like conference rooms
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.540]   and old offices that aren't really used for anything.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:46.300]   And, um, so I want to get a group of people tracking and then anonymize and pool the Collins
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:46.540]   score.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:52.620]   And to be clear about it, practically speaking, you're putting down the score number and then
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.660]   a sentence or two without overthinking it.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:01.000]   Just in the moment, why did you put down that score and that he leaves vague, right?
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.540]   And it's one sentence, two sentences.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.560]   So my tracker that I'm designing is a slight modification on Collins based on my own sort
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.300]   of, how dare you?
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:08.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.080]   Oh, it's, it's funny.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.760]   Usually I try to default towards Collins, but, um, and he actually, I think folds his personal
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.920]   life and his work life together.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.100]   That's a tough decision for me.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.320]   I'm trying to just separate it and just focus on work stuff.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.960]   Yeah, but he, to him, it's all the same thing.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:26.980]   Um, but, uh, in the morning, uh, the, the tracker would ask you two questions.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.940]   One, what time are you going to shut down?
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.920]   Two, which is helpful because then it reminds you to shut down.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.380]   And then two, it, uh, what would you have to achieve today to get a plus one?
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.400]   And then at that time you set, it comes back to you and says, how'd you rate your day?
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.060]   In your vision, this is an app.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:42.580]   Uh, yeah.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.080]   On your phone.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.560]   Uh, and then how would you rate your day?
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.700]   Why would you rate it that way?
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:54.400]   And then how much hours of creative time or a heads down focused time did you have?
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:03.620]   And so what, from the research standpoint, what you would get every day is two, uh, quantitative
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.440]   metrics and one qualitative metrics.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.640]   And that's really the magic because the qual and the quant together create the full picture.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.040]   A lot of times people just track quantitative stuff and you can tell like what's going on,
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.520]   but you have no idea why the qualitative stuff tells you why.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.480]   What, what are you going to tell a manager though?
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.160]   Let's say you do the research, you're doing it at someone's office and you find like, look,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.180]   when, when people look at the qualitative and quantitative, when they're able to spend three
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.900]   hours heads down or something I think is important, they're plus one days.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.420]   And when they can't, they're negative days.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.060]   You're jumping ahead.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:33.880]   We'll jump ahead.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:41.240]   So like, um, what I want to do with my team is get everybody tracking or get like, this
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:41.700]   is opt in.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.080]   I'm not going to force anybody to track stuff, you know?
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.440]   And I think everybody just keeps their own data, but like pools the number anonymously.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.620]   Um, but this, so it's accurate.
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.860]   That's important.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.540]   And so, uh, but then what I want to do is I want to take some of these underutilized
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.260]   spaces and get everybody together and say, okay, Hey guys, and this is a architecture group.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:06.620]   So we, we know about designing space, but I want to be really intentional and say, what,
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:12.180]   how could we reallocate these spaces that give us the best chance of upping our collective
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:12.680]   con score?
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.800]   What would we turn these into that would make us even happier or more productive and more
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.720]   effective architects?
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.860]   Would you then measure it?
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:20.300]   That's the idea.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.920]   And then we just keep tracking and you can, through the qualitative data, you should be able to
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.220]   point to these things.
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:33.200]   And you know, the, the, the subjectivity piece, some people view it, uh, I think fairly as a,
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.500]   as a vulnerability because you're like, well, what if you get a nasty text from,
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:41.320]   somebody, you know, from your spouse, is that going to affect your con score that day?
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:47.880]   But like the, the, the constant day after day, after day, after day, like you build trends
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.540]   really fast, you know?
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:57.300]   And, and so I, I'll tell you, I've become so effective at this that I changed my own personal
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:05.540]   scale from negative one, zero one, 1.5 and two, because I'm so, I, I reserve twos for really
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:12.220]   exquisite days, but I'm so regular at one that I'm trying to push it a little further,
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:12.640]   you know?
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.740]   And I've never had a negative two.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.160]   Well, so, so what, what have you changed in your life?
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.520]   Because of this?
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.400]   Um, I think I, I take on less for sure.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.980]   So when you're, when you're busier, you had a harder time getting good scores.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.520]   Because you always feel inadequate.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.660]   You're always feeling like you're chasing or you're on the hamster wheel or whatever.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:41.500]   I mean, or you're, you're, you're too ambitious about the amount of things you take responsibility
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:42.000]   for.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.160]   Whereas if like, I would rather get half the number of things done, but do them as like at
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.200]   a really high level.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.120]   It's just an example of like my theory of administrative overhead aggregates.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.160]   So the more things you're doing, the more, the bigger fraction of your day has to be spent
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:58.840]   not doing things.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.300]   That sort of ironic cycle.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.200]   I think that's true.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:07.320]   And like there's a, I think you, you would probably understand this and be able to articulate
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:13.760]   this better than me, but there's an inherent risk there that if I'm doing less, I'm going
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.360]   to be perceived as not as interesting or not as well-rounded or not as comprehensive or whatever,
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.080]   you know?
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:25.900]   Whereas if you focus on the things that you're really interested in and curious about, and you
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:33.320]   maintain like a long commitment to those, they blossom into, uh, something that's authentically
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:39.640]   interesting and exciting and people like, uh, are attracted to that.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.920]   A satisfaction engine.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.780]   You know, like for what, like they take you seriously.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.560]   Like what, what's an example in your life?
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:53.220]   Um, so for me, I mean, it is, well, even this conscore thing, you know, like I didn't come
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.860]   upon that by accident, I came upon that because I'm obsessed with the concept of flourishing
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.140]   and how to help other people flourish, you know?
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:05.900]   And so I'm trying and like, I had developed rare and valuable skills in the high performance
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.320]   buildings from like an energy resources stuff standpoint.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:15.780]   And now I'm trying to like take what, apply what works over here or to this other place.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:22.700]   You know, that is, that's right on the very edge of what's, you know, innovative in
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.860]   my field right now.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.120]   Right.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.460]   So you're saying you're, you're playing the long game on the idea you were just explaining
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.220]   to us, for example.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:28.580]   Yes.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.720]   But working on that and continuing to work on that might be a big innovation in the field.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:38.180]   And that is a choice versus you could be much busier with many more smaller projects,
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.580]   which like in the moment would make it feel like you had your finger in a lot of pies and
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.660]   we're getting after it and et cetera, et cetera, but I can take that concept.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:51.680]   I mean, I've got a, there are a series of conferences that are influential in my field and I want
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:58.000]   to use, I have, I have the vision for a slide to start the talks that are coming this fall.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.820]   That is like 0.012 and then arrow and like 1.15.
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:10.900]   And like, that would be like my office's count score moving from like hovering around zero to
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.380]   like plus ones.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.820]   This is like, that's going from languishing to flourishing objectively, you know?
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.160]   Right.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.980]   So if you can have that slide, if I can just work towards that slide, man, baby, we, I spent
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.300]   like we tried this in the physical space, then it changed the score.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.900]   And then we tried this and it made a big difference.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.340]   It's whatever it is.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:29.960]   And it might not work.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:37.820]   You know, and I'm like a little bit probably in a kind of a petty way, afraid that I'm going
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.920]   to try this thing and people are going to reject it or whatever.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.460]   But, um, I don't care that much.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.360]   Like my ego has been diminished.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:50.380]   Like through, do you think the score keeping the score helped motivate the farm in the sense
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.400]   that now when you're thinking about your life in this way, you're thinking this is going
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.160]   to be a plus two generator.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:54:00.320]   Well, I know for a fact that I was, I didn't know that it would be as effective as plus
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.720]   two generator as possible.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:08.040]   And like, I literally, I was like, I remember, it's funny that you mentioned this, this memory
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:15.060]   kind of flashes back, but, um, you know, like chest notation, like how they give like exclamation
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.100]   points next to good moves.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.980]   And like, if it's a really good move, it gets two exclamation points.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.860]   It's kind of similar to the plus, plus two thing.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.560]   I know this from you.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.420]   You explained this to me once.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.580]   And in all the chest notation I've ever seen, I saw one three exclamation point move, which
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:30.160]   was Bobby Fisher's game of the century.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.500]   Uh, and like, uh, Ruben finds like, uh, commentary on that game.
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.160]   But like the day we actually got the farm was the only plus three day I've ever had.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.520]   You mean the, when you're walking through the property, like we signed the contract at the
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.800]   bank and we went over and it's like, oh, you know, that was plus three day, you know?
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   And I was just so happy, but what I didn't anticipate was that, and we got it in January
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.720]   in Wisconsin on Lake Michigan during a winter that was cold as hell.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.040]   Right.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.760]   So it's not like a beautiful, a beautiful spring day that the birds were chirping.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:02.440]   No, no, no.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:08.180]   And, uh, so our initial wave of work to get it kind of going, I was working out there when
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:15.500]   it was like 10 degrees every day, every single day in that first month that I was there was
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.900]   a plus two.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.660]   Did you, you spent like a whole month out there?
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.760]   Every day plus two.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.300]   And I like, I'd never expected or experienced anything like that.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.320]   It was just, you know, and now they're not all plus two days out there.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.440]   But like, it was so great, you know?
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.820]   And, um, uh, yeah.
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.620]   Wow.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:40.540]   But, uh, that's not the, that's not the, I don't think that's the point.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.060]   The point isn't huge string of plus twos.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:50.860]   The, the point is trying to get from trying to just live a flourishing life, you know?
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:59.860]   And that's why I think, I think the days that are, you know, for a lot of people who zeroes
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.920]   are the days where you just feel what happened.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.580]   Where did today go?
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.600]   You know, and what happened is that, you know, your device still had your concentration
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:15.040]   and you spent too much time worrying about things that you can't control and reading about them
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:20.140]   in the New York times, you know, and letting people live rent free in your head, uh, instead
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.140]   of just getting control of your, your own situation.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.000]   I mean, what's interesting to me, to me about it is like, if we look at your life,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.780]   for example, it's not built on some radical decision.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.320]   It's not built on, I was miserable.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.260]   This is the cliche.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:39.060]   And we moved to a sailboat and whatever.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:43.440]   And it's some very like, and through the radicalness of it, this way I like the call and score idea
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.000]   is I feel like it allows you to explore the landscape of possibilities in your life more
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.740]   systematically and build out a flourishing life, which is different necessarily than a life
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.580]   built around some sort of central radical decision.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:03.460]   So it's built, my life is built on the ashes of a failed radical decision, you know, and the,
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:10.400]   uh, but like it was a youthful, you know, indiscretion, let's say where like when I was an undergrad,
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:17.600]   I tried to do, um, a sort of a heroic, uh, you know, design build project in Central America,
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.460]   you know, the poor community.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.280]   And I didn't have a sustainable skillset.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.900]   So even though it was like really deeply aligned with my mission and my values and even like
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:30.100]   the skills I was building, I didn't have the ability to execute.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.280]   But this was a thing back then, right?
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:32.980]   I remember this.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:38.080]   There was like the, the late nineties, early thousands, this idea of, it's like project water.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.200]   It was like this fall, your passion to be useful though.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:42.440]   Right.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.620]   And it was like the ideas you would go somewhere and build a school is a big thing.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:46.940]   Right.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.820]   Pencils and promise.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.080]   Project water.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.760]   Like this was, I was right in the mix.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.200]   Three cups of tea.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.580]   And even design for, or architecture for humanity.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:03.100]   Um, so a lot of it, what, this is actually what like the Dalai Lama calls sloppy sympathy.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:10.040]   You go to a place where you, you see a problem, you want to help, you throw a little energy
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:10.460]   at it.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:15.120]   But if you really want to be helpful, you have to move there and you have to like transform
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.440]   your whole life and, and be extremely humble.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.980]   You know, and accept a lot of failure before you probably get successful.
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.840]   And I did not take that approach.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.940]   Some people do take that approach and they like, they're, they, they do really impressive
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:34.100]   work, but like, I felt the sting of taking the leap before I was ready.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.620]   And what happens is you get alien.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:43.860]   You, the failure alienates you from the thing that you really love, you know?
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:50.340]   So, um, I think the goal got confused with the thing, the goal was the, the vision here's
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.320]   something that's important to me.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.500]   We often confuse it with the radical goal.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:58.580]   Well, if I do this radical goal, which was inspired by this feeling of whatever it is,
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.500]   I want to be helpful or whatever it is, but then the radical goal becomes the thing.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.820]   And so when that fails, you, you lose the connection.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:09.060]   We talked about lifestyle-centric planning, the difference between the, the properties you're
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.580]   looking for in your life and the particular things that might generate those things in
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:12.940]   your life.
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.180]   I'm with you.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.320]   I'll, I'll give you another example that's contemporary for me.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:21.900]   But what happened?
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.600]   Finish the story though.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:22.980]   So what happened?
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.840]   Oh, so what happened is that it was a, the project was a failure.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.720]   I felt humiliated, but I kind of nursed that wound for a long time.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.260]   But then I, you know, I, that's when I came across so good.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.000]   They can't ignore you.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.580]   And I like, I started like connecting dots.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.560]   Oh, rare and valuable skills.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.080]   Okay.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.540]   So there are rare and valuable skills you would need to be successful in that environment
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.100]   rather than just an architect working in Tacoma Park.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.200]   Um, oh, career capital.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.560]   You know, maybe I shouldn't have like skipped steps here.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:57.300]   Maybe I should have become an effective human being first and then gone on to those types
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:57.580]   of things.
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:08.920]   So, um, that, that was really, uh, that was really meaningful in terms of, you know, creating
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:14.040]   a structure where I had like greater patients, a different set of expectations about what was
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.420]   possible.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:21.140]   And so like a big project that I'm, uh, gearing up to take on right now is writing a book,
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:27.620]   uh, on spaces of hyper-creativity, which I think is a good idea, the architecture of hyper-creativity.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:33.700]   But the reason that you think it's a good idea probably is because it checks, I've taken the
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:41.140]   time to check the other boxes about like, um, is writing something I can even do or like writing
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.120]   for editing something I can do.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.920]   Is this an interesting idea?
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.480]   But I could see a lot of people that are listening to this that might be nursing book projects of
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.720]   their own being like, okay, I'm going to throw a ton of energy at this.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.340]   And then if it fails, they're going to feel shitty about it, you know?
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.000]   And that's unfortunate.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.120]   And it doesn't have to kind of be that way.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.840]   You can take a more measured methodical approach into like Brad Stahlberg's kind of thing.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.600]   It's like the consistency and like owning up to the fact that like the consistency is more
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.440]   important than the intensity.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.600]   And I would say with that early project of mine that was a failure, it was intensity
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.360]   over consistency for sure, you know?
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:22.120]   Um, and then acknowledging upfront that every single day you sit down to write, it's going
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.060]   to probably be painful.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.820]   You know, and just being, or sometimes it's not.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.100]   And if it's not, uh, enjoy that and ride that wave as long as you can.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.160]   Uh, but if, if, if, if it's not going well, that's okay.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.020]   Just keep grinding.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.460]   It's like building something.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:36.780]   Some days it's a pain.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.000]   And the joints don't fit that day.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:39.840]   Your cuts aren't great.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.680]   It's tedious that day.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:47.000]   And if, man, it helps if you enjoy building stuff, you know, like if people look at this
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.620]   farm project and you know, they're like, was that fun?
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.940]   And I'm like, yeah, for me, it was great.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.660]   Really fun.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:59.020]   You know, so if you can figure out a way to like, and my wife is different.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.600]   She doesn't like to do construction stuff.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.040]   So it's not plus two days for her if she's swinging a hammer or sawing stuff.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.180]   For me, it's great.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.940]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:20.280]   Well, so you came out of, I always, when I talk to you, I internalize a lot.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:21.920]   What do you mean?
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.220]   I do.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.980]   Well, about, about your, your, your approach.
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.780]   I like the intention of it, but I like that you're, you act on it.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.660]   You know, you make, you make choices, you make changes.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.820]   It's easy to get stuck in the zeros or to get stuck in, this isn't quite working.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.360]   There's a lot of negative ones happening, but it seems difficult to change.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.040]   And I think you're better at, you're not scared of change.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.320]   Would you say this is fair?
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.840]   Like the difference between you back then and now is you're not afraid of change.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.420]   It's just your change is more evidence-based now than it was before.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.080]   It's not on a vibe.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.580]   You have data, personal data, insight data.
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.660]   You're like, okay, this is going to be better.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.660]   So why wouldn't I do it?
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:11.400]   I feel like the core skills are so strong that even if whatever I'm currently focused on was
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.480]   a failure, I can reapply the same skill set to the next challenge.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:22.940]   And I'm like, I feel like a very effective person, you know, I think, I think the, the positive
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:29.920]   thing about a lot of the systems that you have, you know, invented or aggregated or whatever
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.020]   clarified for people is that they get things out of your head so that you're not spending
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:45.100]   time circular thinking about something, you know, and you, you're able to then be more present
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:52.320]   in the moment so that when you're working on something, you're applying your whole consciousness
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.520]   towards it so that it like, and then like life is just easier, man.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:02.720]   I mean, how do you, I think what's interesting also about your story is you have a job that
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:08.660]   it's like a traditional knowledge work, like high skill job, but you still have this life
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.480]   that's very like intentional.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.100]   So how do you bring that thinking to a job where you have an email address, you have a calendar
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.200]   because often people think, look, if I really want to change my life in a way that's going
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.620]   to be like plus one plus twos all the time, I have to be like a novelist.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.160]   I got to leave my job there.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.120]   I can't also have a calendar and zoom and email.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.100]   Your job could be overwhelming and distracting and languishing.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.800]   So I can just look side to side and see my peers.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.140]   So how do you keep it different?
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.140]   What's the key, the David DeWayne's approach to knowledge work?
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:56.040]   I think it's about managing, becoming really good at managing expectations and becoming really,
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.600]   really good about managing time.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:05.840]   I consider, like when I, when I show somebody like my time block planner, I describe it as
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.460]   the most essential mental health tool I've ever had.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:20.640]   You know, and like, I think that, um, I think like I'm an ambitious person, you know, like
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.600]   I want to achieve something, you know, that's meaningful in my field, but I don't.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:35.000]   So I take it seriously, but I like at the same time, if like I, I view the effort more
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.860]   important than the rewards, you know, and this is like just classic philosophy stuff, you
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:43.660]   know, try to disassociate the fruits of the laborers and the labor itself, you know, but
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.920]   it doesn't let, it lets you slow down to slow productivity principle is you, it's like the
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.260]   project you're working on this vision you have for using these numerical scores to change
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:53.720]   architecture.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:57.080]   It's not really going to matter in the longterm until we have this right.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.760]   It's like my Apple pay for architecture.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.180]   And if that happens six months from now or a year from, it doesn't matter to you.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.860]   It doesn't have to be done as fast as possible.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.280]   What matters is you're working on it gets done.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:12.400]   And like the hyper creativity book, which would be great because then it would be, it would
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.140]   put into people's path, uh, principles that are like they could apply.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:18.940]   You know?
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:25.520]   And I think I just have this personal kind of feeling that as we go into the AI, uh, kind
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.640]   of an era that creativity is going to become a coin of the realm.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:36.120]   You know, human creativity is going to be really, really important when it be, because a lot
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:42.060]   of the, a lot of the grinding work is going to be relieved.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.820]   And the, what should we do?
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.460]   Why should we do it?
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.540]   You know, it's going to be, um, is going to surface.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:57.340]   So like when you study the, the environments around creative people and the process of creativity
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.600]   itself and get that out there into the public domain, like, man, that's, that's, if I could
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.000]   just do that, I would be pretty happy.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.820]   But to be more concrete, like how do you avoid, for example, in your position, you have a team
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.420]   not, let's say, check an email every five minutes.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.980]   I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll,
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.380]   I'll check email probably too much.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:21.380]   It's, it's not something I feel great about, but, uh, you know, the, the tools are powerful.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.820]   The, the, the, and the grip that they have on your consciousness is really powerful.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:25.840]   What about meetings?
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:40.880]   Um, again, I, I, I think, I think a lot of people, I, I think the thing that's kind of
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.520]   freed me up a little bit is not being paranoid that like my calendar looks empty to other people
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.820]   that are sharing my calendar with me.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:53.520]   Partially because I, I have a physical planner, so I, I don't write a lot of this.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:02.100]   I don't take the step of putting everything I do into Google calendar, but also, um, like
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.240]   I don't equate it with value.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.680]   My value comes from a totally different realm and I am like laser focused on trying to create
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.720]   value in the way.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.020]   And like my, the people that I report to understand what I'm trying to do and they've given me the
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:22.140]   time and to a degree, maybe I've earned the, the, the, the permission to get control of how
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.760]   I do that.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.680]   Um, but that means practically saying no to more meetings, uh, periods of inaccessibility,
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.280]   uh, shutdowns.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.620]   There's so, there are people that I look at all around me that are probably in too many
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.040]   meetings.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.060]   You know, and if you really just buckle down and say like, Hey, you know, I, like, I can't,
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.320]   I can't go to everything.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.420]   Can I skip this one and just go ahead?
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.120]   I don't know.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.340]   The, when people trust you, have your act together on your time.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.720]   They give you leeway.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.820]   Just out of curiosity.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.960]   Did you look at the, uh, planes of marathon thing?
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.720]   Which one?
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.680]   The planes of marathon.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:01.080]   The email I sent you the other day about, um, cause I was, I was captivated by your Elon
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.100]   Musk conversation with Brad Stahlberg and, uh, Clay.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.160]   Was the guy's name?
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.200]   Clay Skipper.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.400]   And it was about like, and I think this is another thing where people, I would imagine
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.560]   people in your audience and even me, like you look at somebody like Elon Musk and you're
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.900]   so enamored, at least pre Twitter with like the stuff that this person was able to accomplish.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.580]   And that's like, you kind of hold that up as this is what success looks like.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:23.800]   Right.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.660]   And me though.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.200]   Trust me out.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:33.540]   But yeah, I did this exercise, uh, as a kind of like, and again, like this is, I did
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:39.900]   a kind of a private writing project that was a buildup to my real attempt at like, uh, commercial
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:44.200]   writing and, but just to get in the habit of day after day after day writing.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.260]   And so this project was, it was very personal.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:53.900]   It was a letter to my daughter and it was about the, like painting a picture for her about like
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.860]   the really beautiful moments in my life and what it felt like to be me at these different
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.860]   times, you know?
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.440]   And I collected a handful of maybe 20 vignettes.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:11.420]   And after that conversation where you're talking about Elon and like our, our society
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:17.620]   or our culture's sense of status and sense of accomplishment and sense of success, I look
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.280]   back at that list and they're very Monday moments.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.260]   There's nothing in there that's about like a huge professional accomplishment.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.320]   There's nothing in there that's about like brushing up against a celebrity, you know,
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:36.240]   it's all just like, it's like a moment on the farm, like working in the orchard, you know,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.880]   or like working on a building project.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:46.380]   It's about, um, an early morning writing session and my daughter sneaks up on me, you know, and
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:51.240]   I have this like nice moment with her, you know, when she's little and I, you know, um,
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:57.160]   you know, or like the, like a child's birth or something like when you really think about
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:04.900]   like deep life for me, it's like those moments, like enjoy what you have.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:15.900]   Don't peg so much of your sense of self-worth on like a grandiose accomplishment, like on
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.560]   revolutionizing the electric car industry in America, you know?
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:27.940]   And like, I think if you, if you connect or if you were able to peer into the lives of people
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:34.900]   that have done those things, I bet you would find that they made a lot of personal sacrifices
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.460]   that would be pretty grim.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.500]   Lonely.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:39.900]   Alienating.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:49.180]   So like when I think about deep life, I mean, I think about like, I've lost one day, you know?
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.780]   I mean, it's engineering your life.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.640]   That's one way to look at it.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.880]   Engineering a life so that you have more plus ones.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.840]   And it's not too hard to avoid the negatives.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.960]   It's the trend.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.000]   It's the big trend, you know?
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:08.360]   And being, um, yeah, like being super intentional about it.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.500]   So, so this is what, this is what bugs me or you'll, we can, we can jointly crack on
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.700]   these people, but there are a lot of people that look at scans at self-help, you
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:24.400]   know, and the, this whole like advice and like productivity and like that, this whole
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.440]   subculture, you know?
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.260]   You mean like the reviewers at the New York times book review?
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.360]   Perhaps.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.720]   They don't seem to appreciate it.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.100]   I've learned.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:42.900]   But, um, I think if you, like, if you really, I feel like I've been on both sides of this.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.840]   I've been on the, I've been on the, um, sort of hapless.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.640]   Don Quixote style, passion driven mindset, follow your passions guy.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.600]   Um, and ridden that wave.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:06.140]   Um, but I've also been on the, like very regimented, very disciplined, very patient, very slow, um,
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.220]   very focused side of this.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.420]   And it's just better.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.800]   You know, it's not fancy.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.520]   It's not, um, it hasn't made me rich.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.940]   Like in terms of money, but it's made me extremely rich just in terms of like my overall life
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:19.440]   satisfaction.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.480]   You know?
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:26.720]   I mean, I, I have this argument often with, with the anti-productivity crowd, many members
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.700]   of whom I really like and respect because I think they're onto something and, uh, but they,
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:36.700]   they often, I think the setup, which I don't buy is look, if there's structure in your life,
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:43.540]   then you're somehow internalizing capitalist narratives or Protestant work ethic, or it's
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:47.160]   some sort of exploitative relationship from a cultural superstructure to your life that's
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.240]   benefiting other people.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.880]   And that the true, I can see that, but like, it doesn't, it doesn't take a lot of thinking
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.160]   to, to just realize that you don't deep work to do more for the man deep work to work less
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.520]   and to make your work better.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:07.480]   If I could, if I could go back in time, I mean, I went to, uh, punishing graduate program
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.920]   like architecture.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:17.220]   Um, it was, it was so, the culture was so intense that I think there were 24 people in my graduating
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:25.280]   class, 17 of them were medicated for anxiety and depression because we were in our like studios
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.180]   constantly, you know?
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:32.500]   And the people that weren't there were sort of like marginalized a little bit socially,
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.160]   not serious.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.920]   Like, why are you, why did you even take up somebody else's, somebody else could have gotten
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:46.980]   that spot and been here with us, you know, man, if I could go back in time and, uh, I think
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:56.340]   I could have done better work, been such a, like a much healthier person and worked less time.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:05.460]   Just simply by having like better time management, better, like the ability to concentrate, you
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:11.940]   know, and also not like, and, and readjusted my expectations and not tried to like do everything.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.020]   You know?
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:14.520]   So, yeah.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.980]   I mean, people don't, what they don't often get, like people who will look at deep work,
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:23.200]   for example, and, and be like, well, this is all about maximization.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:23.820]   Right.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:28.500]   So I often get the critique of like, man, this is all about just like squeezing everything
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.300]   out of the day.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.620]   And what about people who can't squeeze as much out of the day?
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:35.200]   And what's often missed is like that book was the followup to so good they can't ignore
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:35.420]   you.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.500]   Like it was the answer to the question.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:41.000]   So good they can't ignore you said, if you have valuable skills, you can create your own
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:41.260]   life.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:45.020]   And, and clearly you could see the bias in that book, that the visions I had of life
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:45.980]   was like yours right now.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.360]   I was, you know, you have autonomy, you have control over your time.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.820]   I was very stressed and I remain very stress sensitive.
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:56.900]   So it was a big, uh, motivating factor of that book is why do I want control?
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.380]   Cause I don't want a life that looks like Elon Musk, right?
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:04.420]   I don't want, I'm running three companies and a master of the universe and have meetings
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:04.740]   all day.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.580]   I want control and you can get control by being good at things that are rare and valuable.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.220]   And deep work was like, well, how do you do that?
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:14.840]   And like, well, okay, uh, focus, focusing on stuff, deliberate practice, get better, do
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.980]   the stuff that really matters.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.200]   You don't have to be busy.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.020]   Right.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:22.640]   So it's kind of ironic that for some people, deep work is seen as some sort of like hustle
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.320]   culture bro manifesto of, of like crushing it and getting after it, where to me, that was
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.020]   the skeleton key for unlocking, being able to go to the farm on the weekend.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.060]   When I think about deep work, I just think about eudaimonia.
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.040]   It's another, it's a synonym.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:42.280]   You know, and you know, for those of your audience that don't know what eudaimonia is,
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.780]   look up the Wikipedia entry, but it's, it's a old term that, uh, the Greeks had just like
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.620]   many Greek terms.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.420]   I'd always say flourishing would be my translation.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.800]   Deep human flourishing.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.520]   But like, what's also cool about eudaimonia is that it like the weak translation is happiness,
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.040]   but like in contemporary culture, happiness comes and goes like you could be unhappy in this
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.100]   meeting and happy in the next meeting and then unhappy again.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:06.560]   Eudaimonia was not that.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:14.280]   Eudaimonia was like, um, like, uh, uh, uh, it was the trend.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.920]   Are you, are you on the trend?
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.020]   The right trend.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:23.180]   And so like, uh, yeah, I think about, but it's also like the feeling, it's like the flow
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:26.760]   feeling or like, like a highly, you know, concentrated feeling.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.420]   And like, if you're applying that to, you know, like the, uh, what was cool about eudaimonia
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:37.940]   eudaimonia in the way that Aristotle describes it in the ethics is that even an inanimate
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.140]   object could express eudaimonia.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:46.480]   So like for a knife, uh, I think is the example he uses it's to be sharp and cutting something.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.600]   It's very teleological.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:53.900]   So it's like, uh, it, like the easiest way to think about that is like for you, what is
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.800]   the best version of yourself and how are you engaged?
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:57.780]   You know?
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:04.480]   And so I think like, you know, something like deep work, it's, it's not about, yeah,
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.420]   it's not about piling up more capital.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:10.940]   It's about being sharp and engaged, you know?
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.360]   So, yeah.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.660]   And that was my, my program was different than yours.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:20.320]   Like my grad program experience, the theory group over there at MIT, working too much would
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:20.820]   be bad.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.380]   Like they had their own pathologies, but if you are working too hard, that might mean you're
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:24.880]   not smart.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.400]   And like for them, the ultimate was coming up with a brilliant idea, like a math insight,
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.600]   solving a theorem, being smart, being a monster mind.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.700]   And so it was not a, it was a high stress place in the sense that huge imposter syndrome.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.800]   But if you could get over that, it was completely reasonable.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.480]   You're like, yeah, I'm not here.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.140]   I'm, I, I want to come in and stare at the whiteboard and like solve a proof and then go
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.100]   play bongos or whatever.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.000]   Like that would be like, that's really impressive.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.020]   It had its own pathologies, but I think that also laid an interesting idea in my mind.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.300]   It was like, yeah, focusing could be very valuable.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:56.920]   It's very human.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.680]   I mean, Aristotle thought that was ultimately the theology of all people was deep thinking
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.780]   because only humans can do that.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.380]   That must be human purpose.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:07.640]   But they really didn't value busyness.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.840]   And that really stuck.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.860]   And I think that stuck with me as I was writing my books and thinking about things.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.400]   It's like, I came up in a place where busyness, like what value is there in busyness?
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.840]   Like, what does that have to do in their lingo?
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.620]   What does that have to do with solving proofs?
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.660]   Like that could only get in the way.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:27.300]   And so there was something nice to see that purity.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:32.780]   It's also brutal because you're always being judged if you're smart or not, but it was simple.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:40.060]   Yeah, I think, you know, like for whatever reason, this is where my mind's going when you're talking about this,
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:46.100]   is that like I think a good life is where you're, I mean, I talked earlier about the alternating,
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:55.920]   like my sort of, my charmed life of being alternating between like city life where I feel really engaged and charged or charged up
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.400]   and then country life where I feel very slow.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:05.060]   I think in like a, in a more day-to-day zone, it's like the ability to,
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:11.660]   and the ability to concentrate on something and go kind of internal and grind
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:16.800]   and then come out of that and share it with somebody and get, and feedback, you know?
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:21.640]   And like, it's the, it's the kind of rhythm between highly social, highly focused, you know?
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:29.960]   And my, for my longstanding critique on open office spaces is that instead of those things being intentional
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.580]   and putting like a logical barrier, like visual, audio, proximity barrier between those things,
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.900]   you're all supposed to, you're supposed to do all that stuff at the cubicle.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.140]   And at any second, somebody could tap you on the shoulder.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:48.420]   At any second, somebody could send you an email that you have to respond to instantly, you know?
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.700]   And it is just, it is no way to live effectively.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:56.120]   I've always thought open office is the physical correlate to an email inbox.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.300]   The email inbox was like, can't we just have everything come through here?
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.440]   It always feels like a blender.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.820]   It takes your brain, puts in like a Vitamix or whatever and just like, you know?
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:09.100]   But this is the cybernetic vision of like the Silicon Valley inspired office, right?
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.960]   It's like, this is what email and later Slack is.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.940]   Like, can't we just be in this hive mind and we're just all talking to each other all the
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.240]   time.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.500]   Things are moving back and forth.
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.440]   I'm answering your question.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.040]   You're answering me this.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:18.820]   You're sending me this file.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:19.540]   What about this?
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.040]   And our minds will be melded together.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.660]   And out of that will come sort of distributed intelligence, which of course misses the way this
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:29.000]   wetware actually works in our head because we can't actually, we're not bees.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.800]   We can't be plugged into constant unrelated conversations at all time and also flourish or
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.020]   produce good thoughts or not be completely stressed out.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.080]   I pay a social cost at work for resisting Slack.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:47.380]   And I do like, I, I tell people like I only check Slack every once a day or something, you
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:50.040]   know, and it annoys people.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.400]   Well, it's convenient if everyone's on it.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:58.340]   I, like I, I would have to take a different approach if I was like more in the trenches
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:01.440]   on like a project day to day and that's like how the team was communicating and then I would
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.160]   change my behavior.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:07.180]   But for me right now, it's like, how many more tools do I need to do the exact same thing?
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:13.280]   You know, like, uh, let's say it's email versus no email solve some problems.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.500]   Fax machines were slow.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.960]   Couriers were even slower.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   Voicemail was annoying.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.320]   It's like email kind of solve those problems.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:21.260]   Okay.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:21.620]   We're good.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.780]   Um, and we don't need to use it as constant conversation and we don't need, I mean, I've
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:29.240]   always argued Slack is just the, they built the right tool for the wrong way to work.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.940]   Like if this is what you're going to do is use email, which was supposed to be a voicemail
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.120]   fax machine replacement as like an ongoing back and forth conversation machine.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.860]   Well, that's not a great tool for doing that.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.780]   Slack does that better.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:46.200]   If what you want to do is let's just have everyone be in touch at all times so that there's no
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.600]   friction and we can keep things moving.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.240]   Email has some shortcomings.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.180]   So Slack will solve those shortcomings.
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:55.300]   So a great tool for implementing that way of collaboration, terrible way of collaborating
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.760]   outside of like a small team working together on something.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.960]   So it was, it's like, that's, it's a love, hate relationship.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.900]   I've always said, because if that's the way you're collaborating, like, I love this.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.880]   It's better than email, but also you hate that way of collaborating.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.660]   So it's like, I don't know what to do.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:10.920]   You know?
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.900]   Like, uh, yeah, if we're going to use Slack, then let's just get rid of our emails.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.660]   You know, there's, I've heard of the architecture office.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:23.120]   One of my colleagues works in where they don't have individual email accounts.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.580]   They just have project email accounts.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.120]   I've been advocating for this.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:27.900]   It's a cool idea.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:28.820]   It's arbitrary.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:33.900]   The fact that it's a name at domain.com or whatever.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:37.260]   I mean, that's just a, just a happenstance that the original email programs, the mail
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:40.660]   demon on Unix was from timeshare computers.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:45.860]   So in timeshare computers, you had to have a login so they could bill you for the time
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.400]   you were using in the original email.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.360]   What it would really do is just leave texts in a text file in someone else's account.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.980]   And then you could read it when you came into your account.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:57.740]   And so that's where it was your username for timeshare computers became your de facto email
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.120]   addresses.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.660]   But there's a counterfactual I've talked about where, yeah, you have emails for projects and
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.420]   that like completely changes by the way, how the tool is used.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:12.320]   Because as soon as I think about an email being your name, I imagine a interpersonal interaction
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.940]   that you're someone, there's someone on the other end of this.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:16.460]   And I want something from that person.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.420]   And if you're not answering me, there's a person who is slighting me.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.000]   And I imagine you're there and you saw it and you're ignoring me.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.400]   You get all the interpersonal dynamics.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.640]   If it's a project, all that goes away.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.540]   Like, yeah, I'm sending a request over to this project and, you know, they'll get back to me.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.620]   I'm sure multiple people are looking at this.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.620]   And they, they, and they have a standard.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.900]   They'll get back to you by the end of the day, if it comes before whatever.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.320]   And you don't think twice about it.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.880]   Like all the interpersonal dynamics are gone.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:41.800]   Well, I'm excited, man.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.960]   I'm excited about deep, uh, deep life.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.620]   Uh, I'm, I'm curious.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.380]   How is that?
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:55.300]   How is actually working on that project changed your, your outlook or change your habits anyway?
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.040]   We'll see.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.160]   We'll see.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:01.320]   I'm, I'm in the first part still, which is like how to become, how to get your act together
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.460]   before you try to change your life.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:08.400]   I sense you being more like discerning about bigger things in your life, you know?
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.380]   I, and I think working on the second part, which is much more about like what we're talking
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:12.980]   about today.
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:16.100]   I'm worth, there's changes coming probably.
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.480]   I'm thinking about changes.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.740]   I think it'll probably lead to some changes.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.400]   I mean, I, it's just a stage of life where I'm going through, you know, how your forties
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:23.680]   are.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.600]   It's a different stage of life.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:36.680]   And it like, but it like, it feels like, uh, on the vector, like a logical conclusion
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.300]   to the vector you've been on for several books now.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.220]   I think so.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:40.900]   I think so.
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.520]   I mean, you can imagine, yeah.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.560]   Slow productivity is getting at, well, what does it really mean to be productive at work?
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.100]   And this, let me, let me articulate my approach, which is it's slower.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.140]   It's like you talked about.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:57.000]   Let's, I want results over time, but my busyness in the moment, it's not that important.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.940]   And if anything, that's going to be counterproductive.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.080]   It's going to make me feel worse.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.020]   And so that book is trying to articulate that a world without email was my attempt
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:07.480]   to be like, for God's sakes, do we have to be communicating all the time?
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.000]   Completely failed, by the way.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:09.700]   It did not.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:10.280]   A world without email.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.720]   I mean, it failed to change the world.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.980]   Do you think it was a victim of timing?
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:14.400]   It's a little bit of victim of timing.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:19.280]   The pandemic was not when people wanted to think about that, but also it's just a victim
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.120]   of difficulty, right?
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:21.740]   I mean, it's, it's.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.640]   I always thought about world without email is just deep work for companies.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.520]   Deep work for teams.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.040]   And maybe that's just a smaller market if it's something you can't put into place.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.380]   But I've talked to a lot of C, it's just hard.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:33.720]   It's hard to move away.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.440]   Deep work.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.080]   All these books are kind of on these trajectory.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.920]   I see.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.460]   I mean, I'm rethinking, you know, I'm in a different phase of life now.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.260]   You've always been good at that too.
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.120]   You always write about the phase that you're in.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.460]   That's the only way I know how to do it.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.800]   Because if I don't care, it doesn't come through.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.440]   But I mean, I'm in a different phase.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.360]   I've talked about this.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.980]   It's, you know, after college, what were my two goals?
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.040]   Writing academia.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.000]   And let me just focus, go deep on those, not be busy, want to do those well.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.020]   And I've done those well, right?
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.700]   I've been in academia.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.500]   I'm a full professor.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:02.960]   There's no more promotions left to give.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.660]   Published papers.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.500]   Won the awards.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.360]   You know, I did well there.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.060]   Writing, I've done well there.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.620]   I think my, you know, I've sold a lot of books.
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:12.520]   It's, it's, that number is large.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.800]   You've been in this one genre.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.280]   There are other genres.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.320]   You know, you think about, um, you're talking about my romance novel, I assume.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.800]   That's what, that's what people are waiting for.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   Fifty Shades of Cal.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.940]   Fifty Shades of Cal.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.240]   Um, no.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.040]   Like, do you ever think about what Michael Crichton would be writing about right now?
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.360]   I wrote a piece.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.360]   Like, oh, did you?
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.180]   I wrote a piece for the New Yorker a couple months ago.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.760]   About AI or something?
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:39.380]   It was like, what?
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.780]   And he would, he would be going crazy.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:42.960]   Well, he would be going crazy.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.940]   And, and I wrote, it was interesting piece.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.660]   I was like, okay, what are the real lessons from Crichton?
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:49.200]   And I'll just, my, my takeaway was actually unexpected.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.660]   My, my, but my takeaway was because I know Crichton well, um, his work well.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:56.660]   And I know a lot about it more than I probably should, but it's like, you know, really my
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:02.740]   takeaway is what Crichton really understood, um, was the issue was not so much to people
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.980]   when it came to technology.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:07.420]   And I told the story in the front of that article where, you know, when he was trying to write
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:09.000]   the Adronomist strain, it wasn't working.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.040]   And his editor, Robert Gottlieb was like, here's the problem.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.860]   You're trying to write like an actual novel and get into the psychology of the characters
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.260]   and what's going on inside their head or this or that.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.220]   And he said, stop that.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.000]   Write it like a New Yorker piece.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.460]   Like what Matt, the people aren't that important.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:30.100]   What matters is the technology and the unexpected outcomes from the technology, write it like
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:34.660]   you're like Richard Preston in the hot zone 30 years later, like you're reporting on something
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:35.080]   that happened.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:41.440]   And then the book took off and that became his MO is that the, the really what, what mattered
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.500]   in these books was the technology and the unexpected ways they unfold, not the characters.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.400]   Right.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.260]   And I was saying this actually kind of relevant for today because it's, it's right now.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:57.060]   We like to snag our technological storylines onto people and actors and villains.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:00.120]   And it's this person and this person, this is the villain in the play.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.820]   And this is the hero or whatever without getting, and just anxiety generally.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:04.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.900]   Without getting at the actual issue.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:06.120]   Right.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:12.840]   So we want to demonize Elon Musk, but we don't get to introducing global conversation platforms
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.860]   might've been a wrong idea.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:14.560]   Right.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.800]   Because like Hammond was like a nice guy in Jurassic Park.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:22.500]   He was, he had good intentions and he got his liver eaten out by copies at the end of that
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:22.720]   book.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.760]   It wasn't because he was flawed.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.220]   Um, I talked about Frankenstein.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.740]   I went back to the original Mary Shelley and I was like, let me, let me read.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:36.860]   I re replicated the passage in Frankenstein where the animated, the monster, the technology
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.220]   is completely unspecified.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:43.940]   It was the vitality flowed from the machine to the monster and the monster came alive.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:45.200]   The whole thing was about the people.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.000]   It was about the characters and the flaws and Dr. Frankenstein's ambition and, and how
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.400]   that his fatal flaw broke them.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.560]   And you go over to Jurassic Park, Richard Hammond's a cardboard cutout.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.320]   What matters is the specific type of gene sequencer they were using too.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.500]   So anyways, I thought there was a lesson there about, uh, the, the technologies themselves are
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.540]   often creating the impacts and we want to blame or care about the people.
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.900]   But then that obscures the fact that cloning the dinosaurs is the problem.
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:14.100]   Even if like a better person was running Jurassic Park, it might've still been a problem.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.480]   Do you know where the word sabotage comes from?
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.660]   Do we ever talk about this?
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:18.320]   No.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:24.480]   So French or something word for like the French peasant wooden shoe is called a sabbat.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:24.940]   Ah.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:31.400]   And so when the initial machines during the industrial revolution, the agricultural machines showed
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:35.420]   up, uh, like it freaked the peasants out or whatever.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.960]   And they took their wooden shoes and like jammed it into the gears and it would like break the
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.340]   machine.
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:40.560]   So this is like go back to work.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.340]   Like a Ned Ludd type of mythology.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:49.200]   And so like, it was literally the act of like destroying the menacing technology, you
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.820]   know, that was coming after your job or whatever.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:51.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:54.840]   So it seems like there's, there's, you know, history rhymes, right?
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.340]   Yep.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.040]   All right.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:00.120]   Well, we, we have run over, but I, it's hard not to cause I always like talking with you.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.580]   Um, yeah, I really appreciate this conversation.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.040]   So, so, so, um, I think we covered a lot of interesting ground here and I would summarize
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.940]   it all as, you know, it's like architecting the deep life.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:15.900]   There's a, there's a, there's a lot that goes into it and it's not as simple as the one grand
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.240]   plan, but it's, there's, there's a lot in here that I think is interesting.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.980]   Also, we got a nerd out about some work issues like we always do.
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:26.280]   There's a Buckminster Fuller quote that's useful or that I've returned to sometimes where he
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:30.400]   talks about, or he just states we're called to be the architects of the future, not its
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:30.720]   victims.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.340]   You know, I like it.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.780]   And I kind of think like you're called to be the architect of your life.
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:41.560]   Not, not the victim of circumstance, you know, and like what you have put out there in a
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:49.040]   series of tools and books and so forth is like, here are like a suite of tools, apply them.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.580]   You know, and, and life just gets easier.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.560]   And they're content agnostic.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.280]   Right.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.840]   I'm not going to tell you, and this is how I'm writing my book right now.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.440]   It's not, here's the five things you need for a deep life.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:04.740]   This mix of friendship with this mix of adventure, this or that, like, okay, you can figure that
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:07.580]   out, but how do you have the tools to act on it once you figure it out?
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.080]   So like architects.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.940]   And just don't, don't expect immediate results.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:17.000]   So architecture, you have to learn how to design and build a building and then like the great
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   architects use those tools to build falling water or whatever, but you got to learn the
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:22.560]   tools first.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.260]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:23.880]   Like where that's going.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:24.820]   Like, yeah.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:31.000]   And for architecture, I mean, last, last word, I guess, is that, you know, it's, it's a kind
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.580]   of a cliche in architecture that unlike rock and roll, you don't become successful when
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:42.860]   you're like 20, you can become successful when you're like 50 and you just like, it's
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:45.120]   again, it's an expectations management game.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.380]   It takes a long time.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.000]   Anyway.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:47.480]   All right, man.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:47.740]   All right.
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:48.860]   Hey, David, thanks for coming.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:49.480]   Thank you.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.960]   All right.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:57.040]   So that was my conversation with David DeWayne brought to us by done daily.com.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.780]   I really enjoyed that.
[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:00.560]   Here's the, here's the context.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.780]   I talked to David a lot, right?
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.180]   We've known each other for a long time.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.300]   I knew him back before I even wrote deep work.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.520]   He's featured in that book.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.120]   He lived in DC for a long time.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.560]   So we used to see each other more often, but he often comes through DC.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.660]   He used to live in Tacoma park.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:19.120]   And we always have these sort of interesting conversations when he's coming through town and we have these
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.180]   wide range of conversations.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:26.500]   So to be able to capture one of those conversations on air, to record it, to share it with other people,
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:31.720]   that was kind of fun because I'm used to all these cool ideas about depth and focus and concentration
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.520]   and the deep life.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.380]   And it's good to be able to share them with other people.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:40.340]   I also like, I'm going to try to do this more when I have these conversations.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.480]   I think I did this a little bit with Michael Easter as well.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.720]   I like people who are doing cool things with their life and just to hear more about it,
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.440]   as opposed to just having on experts to talk about their ideas.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.860]   Now, David had both of these things.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.960]   He's an expert on space design for concentration,
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.080]   but he's also an expert on his own life being really cool and having that farm and the orchard
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.820]   with the writing gazebo that he built out there.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:03.360]   I think all that's so cool and romantic.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.040]   So I like this idea of like specific people
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.500]   living really specifically deep lives and just hearing how they did it.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.600]   How better to learn than to talk to real people.
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:16.160]   Anyways, I'll probably end up putting some of this ideas on my book on the deep life
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.680]   because he, he has too many good ideas about this topic.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.820]   So this was fun.
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.060]   Thanks for listening.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:25.040]   Uh, be back on Monday with a normal episode and until then stay deep.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.680]   Hey, if you liked this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
