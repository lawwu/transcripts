[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   All right, so now we have a question from Darcy.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.120]   Darcy asks, "How do you get to do things you need to do
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.100]   "with an ever-increasing administration
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.660]   "or administrative overload?
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.700]   "Administrative creep is a massive problem.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.700]   "Every service you hire, activity you perform,
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.740]   "product you buy comes with an ever-increasing
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.340]   "administrative burden.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.840]   "For example, you buy a washing machine,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.840]   "it doesn't work properly, you request a refund,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.000]   "the supplier needs X form completed,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.680]   "they then deny the refund,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.340]   "you then turn to a government agency
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.780]   "to assist in enforcing your consumer rights,
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.380]   "they require a form to be completed,
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.720]   "each interaction is by email,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.760]   "finally you arrive at a tribunal,
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.000]   "they give you a refund,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.780]   "each process requires time and skill.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.780]   "This is all time away from doing deep work."
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.720]   And again, Darcy, I would modify that to say,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.280]   this is all time that would keep you away
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.520]   from the intentional points that you are identifying
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.080]   in your deep life plan,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.960]   the things you wanna be spending time on,
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   whether they're work or non-work related.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.400]   All right, but it's a good question
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.480]   because administrative creep,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.480]   that is the growing burden of small tasks,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.000]   is a big problem.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.160]   I think we underestimate it,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.720]   we in particular underestimate it in the world of work,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.600]   the actual burden of administrative creep
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.740]   on our ability to get things done
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.860]   that actually have value for the organization.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.100]   So I have three ideas, Darcy, that I wanna share here.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.460]   All right, first, I think you need to be more comfortable
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.260]   wasting more money, all right?
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.220]   Yes, your washing machine didn't work right,
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.700]   but man, this is crazy.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.500]   You ended up in a tribunal with the government
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.300]   to try to get the refund back.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.780]   I mean, part of fighting administrative creep
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.320]   is to the extent possible,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.960]   doing less things that generate administrative creep.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.060]   And if you can just spend some money or waste some money
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.740]   and not have to deal with something,
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.260]   to the extent you're able to do that,
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.740]   it's a good investment in time.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.620]   I don't know if that refund was really worth
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.140]   all the time you actually just spent there.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.580]   So that's the first thing I would suggest
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.280]   is try to reduce what you can in your life,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.180]   even if it's not optimal.
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.580]   Like, oh man, I really should return this thing
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.340]   I got from Amazon, it's the wrong size,
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.140]   but I'm gonna have to go to the UPS store
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.380]   and print this label, I don't know what to do.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.120]   It's like, or you just eat the $20.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.700]   So we got a value, time and context shifting.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.340]   That's a real cost that we weigh against things like money.
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.480]   Idea two is to automate.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.560]   So I'm a big believer in this when it comes to small tasks
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   is there's two conditions that a small task can be in,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.860]   cognitively speaking.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.180]   The impact of these two conditions
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.460]   is very different on your brain.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.820]   The first condition is that it can kind of be hanging.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.620]   It's on a to-do list somewhere, but that's it.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.700]   And it's something that needs to get done.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.540]   It's gonna have to, time's gonna have to be found,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.900]   things are, information's gonna have to be gathered
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.760]   and it's sitting there as this sort of weight
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.860]   of something that needs to be done,
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.940]   you're not quite sure when and how it's gonna get done.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.700]   The second condition a small task can be in is not hanging.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.960]   This is when it's getting done in this time, in this place,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.260]   here's where the information is.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.300]   You don't have to, it's not on your list of things
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.460]   that you have to actually exert
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.140]   any additional planning energy towards.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.780]   Automation, when I say automate,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.620]   I mean moving as many of your small tasks as possible
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.180]   into that second condition.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.180]   And there's a few things you can do here.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.100]   One thing is for recurring tasks,
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.320]   you have a way they always get done.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.900]   They always get done the same way,
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.220]   this day on this week, every month,
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.280]   here's the spreadsheet I go through and I pay these bills
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.940]   and I do the budget or whatever it is,
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.220]   but it's the same times, the same days,
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.660]   you don't have to think about it,
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.220]   it's just you get to that day,
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.420]   you see the calendar notice and you execute.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.700]   It's no longer sitting there as something
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.180]   that is gonna require planning energy.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.180]   The other thing you can do is have set times put aside
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.100]   for doing these type of tasks in general.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.340]   And maybe what you're actually doing
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.440]   is assigning tasks to these buckets.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.580]   Tuesday and Wednesdays,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.820]   I have a 90 minute block in the afternoon
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.900]   in which I'm doing, I don't know,
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.340]   student related, class related issues as a professor.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.820]   So students have questions, they need to know their grades,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.300]   there's issues with prom sets or whatever,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.040]   maybe you have 90 minutes twice a week,
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.740]   that's when you do that work.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.460]   So when any of these questions pop up,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.180]   you can just throw them on a list
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.460]   in a shared document somewhere.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.980]   And you just know that list gets processed
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.260]   when you get to Tuesday,
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.060]   and again, when you get to Thursday.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.300]   Again, what you're doing here is moving those small tasks
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.340]   into the second condition
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.480]   where they require no further planning energy.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.560]   The final thing is you could have some sort of system
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.200]   put in place for some of this type of work
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.480]   so that when a request comes in,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.040]   it's not just hanging there loose,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.220]   here's how we handle it.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.400]   Okay, so if this issue comes up, you have to do this,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.360]   you have to put it on my shared calendar,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.280]   there's a each week I put the notes,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.220]   whatever it is, but you have some system in place.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.060]   What I'm trying to do here with automation
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.280]   is get things out of that condition
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.680]   in which planning energy still needs to be applied.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.560]   And the reason is, is that if you give me 20 tasks,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.640]   and in scenario A, each of those 20 tasks
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.920]   is gonna require at some point, planning energy applied,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.760]   it's not clear to you
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.120]   exactly how they're gonna get executed.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.960]   And over here, you have the same 20 tasks,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.520]   no planning energy is required.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.420]   They're all in one of these types of pre-existing systems
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.280]   or processes, et cetera.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.860]   That second scenario is going to have a much smaller
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.640]   negative impact on your mind, on your sense of busyness,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   on the sense of what load is lurking above me.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.480]   It's gonna be work that's gonna get done,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   but almost for free.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.560]   It's like, it doesn't add up to that quota
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.100]   of how much work can you have on your plate
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.460]   before your brain fritzes out and says, I have too much.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.200]   It doesn't add up to that quota,
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.960]   because it's not work you have to think about and plan.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.920]   It's like, you know, you mow the yard on Saturday morning,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.240]   so you don't think about that as, oh my God,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.080]   this is something in my plate I have to figure out.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.300]   So the more you can move tasks in that condition,
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.520]   the least negative impact they're gonna have
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.840]   actually on your brain.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.360]   And then the third thing I'm gonna recommend
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   is don't ignore the impact of attached overhead.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.460]   So any significant project or initiative you agree to do,
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.920]   so the main grist of whatever you do, you know,
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.080]   in your job or whatever you do,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.600]   the big things that really matter,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.180]   like getting this committee together
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.760]   and making a hiring decision,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.860]   updating the newsletter software that our church uses,
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.020]   whatever it is, right?
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.500]   Any non-trivial commitment or project
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.640]   is gonna bring with it a fixed overhead
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.940]   of administrative work.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.800]   And once this is on your plate,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.340]   there's gonna be this fixed overhead
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.700]   of we have to talk back and forth
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.780]   with the other people involved.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.260]   There's gonna have to be some meetings.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.540]   There's gonna be a background drip of emails
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.700]   that are gonna require answering
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.220]   as you're trying to figure things out.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.780]   And you don't want to ignore that fixed amount of overhead,
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.960]   because it does not take much of that
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.860]   until your schedule is overhead dominated.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.120]   And again, I think this is another issue that people have
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.300]   is they just look at the project itself.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.600]   Try to get the software updated for our newsletter.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.640]   We're trying to do a hiring decision
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.040]   and I've agreed to whatever,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   put together a new white paper that we send the clients.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.160]   And you look at just a project in isolation.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.000]   You're like, well, I kind of imagined this taking a few days
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.140]   and this taking a few days and this taking a week.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.700]   And these are the three things I'm working on
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.540]   for the next two weeks.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.360]   There should be plenty of time.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.200]   But what you don't have in mind
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.920]   is that each of these projects is bringing with it
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.460]   this attached overhead.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.820]   So now each of these three projects
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.020]   is bringing with it multiple Zoom meetings a week.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.700]   Each of these projects is bringing with it,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.660]   let's say 10 to 20 back and forth emails per week.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.300]   So now you have 60 back and forth emails,
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.940]   and that's gonna translate to something like
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.140]   five to 600 inbox checks to keep up
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.500]   with these back and forth conversations.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.780]   And the overhead with just these three projects
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.840]   in a two week period,
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   this overhead itself can eat up almost all of your time.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.280]   And now you feel administrative creep
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.560]   and now you feel overloaded.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.320]   So we have to be really careful about
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.840]   how many projects we have on our plate at once.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.040]   I'm a big believer of pull systems.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.800]   Should be working on a very small number
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.400]   of big projects at a time.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.280]   When one is at a stopping point,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.600]   only then do you pull in something new to work on.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.160]   Because if you bring them all on your plate
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.240]   and say, I'll figure it out, the overhead comes with them.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.760]   And whether you're working on this project actively today
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.720]   or not, the overhead doesn't care,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.840]   it's making demands of you.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.560]   So that's the other big source of administrative creep.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.360]   So have much fewer things on your plate
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.780]   because it's not the time required to write the paper
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.800]   or update the software that's gonna kill you.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.860]   It's the 60 emails and the seven Zoom meetings.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.800]   That's what's gonna end up killing you
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.160]   from a scheduling perspective.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.400]   So be very wary about that administrative attached overhead.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.720]   Those three things, be less efficient, waste money,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.640]   automate small tasks, so get them in that condition
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.480]   where they require no further planning attention
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.320]   and being very careful about the overhead
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.160]   that comes with projects.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.880]   So keep your active project queue low at any one point,
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.480]   I think goes a long ways towards keeping administrative
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.960]   creep feeling more reasonable.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.920]   That's a good question.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.800]   That's the bane of my existence, administrative creep.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.780]   I do what I can, but we all struggle with it.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.840]   (upbeat music)
