[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the fourth chapter, verses 17, 18, and 19, in the fourth
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.920]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:28.140]   "This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.200]   Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.360]   from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.800]   of their heart, who, being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.960]   to work all uncleanness with greediness."
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.520]   I want particularly this morning to deal with the seventeenth verse, "This I say, therefore,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.440]   and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.680]   of their mind."
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.400]   Now here, you will recall, we begin a detailed consideration of this great section of this
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.320]   epistle, which, starting here at this seventeenth verse of this fourth chapter, goes right on
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.000]   to the very end of the epistle.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.260]   The apostle is now concerned that these people should know how, in practice and in detail,
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.100]   to manifest the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, and so demonstrate before the
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.280]   world and before the angels in heaven the manifold wisdom of God as being members of
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.360]   the Christian Church.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.640]   Now we analysed the whole section in detail last Sunday morning, and you remember that
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.160]   we said that here, in this subsection, beginning at this seventeenth verse of the fourth chapter,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:16.560]   and going on right until the twenty-fourth verse of this particular section, the apostle
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.920]   gives us the kind of theological or doctrinal basis for our conduct.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.480]   He has got a whole series of them, as you remember.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   He divides it up into various sections.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.280]   Now the particular matter here is this, that we are always to live and to conduct ourselves
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:44.760]   as remembering that, as Christians, we are entirely new men and women, that regeneration
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.820]   is the profoundest change in the world, and that, therefore, we must always keep that
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.480]   in the forefront of our minds, that a Christian is not just a man who has decided to be a
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.560]   little bit more moral than he was, or who has decided to join a church, or who has decided
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.640]   this or that, whatever it may be.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   No, no.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.640]   What makes a man a Christian is that he has been born again, he has been given a new nature,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.400]   he is a new creation, he is altogether different from what he was before.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.800]   Now that is the first principle which the apostle takes up in this section, which goes
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   on to the end of the epistle.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.240]   And here he is now beginning to apply that.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.360]   Here is the first thing he says, "Remember that about yourselves, and as you remember
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.000]   that, well, you will find that certain things are quite unthinkable, they are impossible,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.840]   you will never look at them again, because you see now so clearly that you have been
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.360]   separated from all that once and forever."
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.720]   Now then, that is what he is going to say in this particular section that we are looking
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.800]   at together.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.160]   But now let us look at it in the exact words which the apostle himself uses.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.720]   Let us consider his way of stating that.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.560]   And we find that he does so in this manner.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.120]   He starts off by addressing them in a most solemn manner.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.440]   He wants to call attention to the thing.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.960]   It is of vital importance.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:36.040]   So he says, "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord."
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.120]   He is not content with saying, "This I say therefore."
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.720]   That would be strong, but he adds to that, "This I say therefore, and testify."
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.960]   Now what does he mean by this "testify"?
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.400]   Well, it really means "solemnly to enjoin."
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.580]   It is as it were that he is invoking a witness.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.200]   When you give a testimony, you are bearing witness, you are witnessing to something.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.920]   A witness is put into the box and he testifies, that is it.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.280]   And that is exactly what the apostle is saying.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.600]   He is anxious that they should not think for a moment that this is just his own personal
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.840]   opinion because there were probably people then, indeed there were people then as there
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   are now.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   They say, "But it is only Paul's opinion."
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.680]   That is what Paul thinks.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.800]   "Don't you say that," says the apostle, "this isn't just a personal fable of mine.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.480]   This isn't just something that I, because I happen to have a narrow mind, am saying
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.100]   or thinking.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.000]   It isn't because I was a Pharisee and trained in the law.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   No, no.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It isn't merely I whom is speaking this, I say therefore, and testify in the Lord."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.520]   Now he means by that "in the Lord" not so much that he is invoking the Lord as his witness.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.640]   People sometimes do that.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.600]   You get that even in the scripture, "As God is my witness," they say, or in the presence
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.800]   of God.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.460]   Now it doesn't mean exactly that that idea is probably here, but surely what he means
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:25.600]   is this, that he is testifying to this as one who is in the Lord.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.400]   He is one who is in communion with the Lord.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.000]   He is delivering therefore what is a divinely authenticated commission.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.080]   He is one who is daring to say that he is speaking as one who has access to the mind
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.120]   of the Lord.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   Now you notice, you remember how in his first epistle to the Corinthians in the seventh
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.320]   chapter, he draws that kind of distinction.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.240]   He says at a given point, "Now this is what I think.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.180]   I haven't the mind of the Lord here."
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.440]   That was Paul's opinion.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.960]   And when it is Paul's opinion, he tells us that it is his opinion.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.100]   But when he doesn't say that, he is speaking in the Lord.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:18.880]   In other words, he is speaking again with the full authority of an apostle.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.280]   Not only was the great and glorious doctrine revealed to him, as he tells us in the third
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.640]   chapter, but this was also revealed to him.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.520]   These details about conduct have the same apostolic authority, the same divine authority
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   therefore, as have his expositions of the doctrines.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:47.920]   And he is speaking again as one who has been clothed with this unique authority that belonged
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.680]   to the apostles.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.360]   We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.400]   He has given these apostles to the church.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.080]   And when they spoke and they taught, they spoke with a unique authority.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.280]   Their words were divinely inspired.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.920]   They have the authority of God.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:13.040]   "I testify," he says, "in the Lord."
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.040]   Very well.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   What is he testifying to?
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.560]   What is he saying?
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:25.080]   What is this injunction which he puts to them in such a solemn manner, having arrested their
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.920]   attention and having made them realize that they are listening to the word of the living
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   God?
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.620]   Well, here it is.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.520]   You notice that he puts what he is going to say, first of all, negatively.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:56.360]   "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not the negative."
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.280]   We are so busy today, aren't we, that we don't like negatives.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.920]   We haven't really got time for negatives.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.820]   We want the positive truth.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.120]   And we don't like criticisms of that which is wrong.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.080]   We must always be positive.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:14.160]   My dear friend, I do hope you are seeing the utter folly of such idle, vacant talk.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.960]   Here is the divine authority speaking through the apostle, and the first thing we have is
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.880]   negative, "not."
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.360]   We have got to realize, first and foremost, what we must not be.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   It is not enough to tell men and women here in this world, in a world like this and in
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.880]   the flesh, simply what they are to do.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.800]   We all know perfectly well how inadequate that is.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.760]   We must be taught, first and foremost, what we are not to be.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.920]   This idea that you have just told the ideal before men, and they will at once conform
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:55.560]   to it, has been so completely disproved by the history of the human race that it is almost
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.160]   incredible that anybody should still believe that.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   No, no.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   We are told, first of all, what we must not do.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.560]   Well, what is that?
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:09.200]   Well, he says we must not walk as the other Gentiles do.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.800]   But look at the words, how wonderful they are.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.160]   Every word really is conveying some important meaning to us.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.200]   Take the word "walk," for instance.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.040]   That you henceforth walk, not as the other Gentiles walk.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   What does this mean?
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.320]   Well, that means the whole life and conversation.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.760]   Often in the Authorized Version you will find the word translated as "conversation."
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.280]   "Only let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ," says this same Paul
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.680]   to the Philippians.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.960]   He says, "Our conversation is in heaven."
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   It means the whole life, the general tenor of the life, and at the same time, the life
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.840]   in detail.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.360]   The "walk" means, as used in Scripture, the whole of a man's life, inward and outward.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.960]   Now, we must remember that "walk" is not confined to the outward; it involves the inward.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.440]   Now, that is a very important point which I shall be coming to stress in a moment, because
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.120]   according to this whole argument, what determines the outward is the inward.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:28.040]   A man is as he thinks, and a man walks as he thinks, and his walk tells you what he
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   is thinking.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.360]   His walk is an expression of his philosophy.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.800]   Very well then, here is something he tells us about the whole of our life, and what he
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:48.520]   tells us is that henceforth—now there is a significant word—it means "no longer."
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.560]   And here, you see, at once he is introducing us to his doctrine.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:12:00.720]   He says, "I am telling you and testifying in the Lord that you no longer must walk as
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.840]   the Gentiles do."
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.560]   You see the implication, don't you?
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.960]   You once did walk like that, but you are no longer walking like that.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   Why?
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.120]   Well, because of this tremendous change that has taken place in you.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.320]   So the very word "henceforth," if you like, contains the whole of the gospel.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   Henceforth tells us this.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.200]   There is the past.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.720]   That is what they once were.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.160]   There is the unregenerate life.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.200]   Henceforth, something has happened.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.000]   Now then, the future, it is going to be altogether different.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.760]   And immediately, you see, we are told what a profound change the regeneration produces,
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   how this Christian man is indeed a new man.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.040]   Old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:57.760]   Well, then take his other phrase, that he henceforth walk not, I read here in the Authorized,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.200]   not as other Gentiles walk.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.360]   Now, you will find in the revised versions and the parallel to that that they have not
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.600]   the word "other," that you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.800]   Well, that is purely a matter of documents, and it seems that the oldest and the most
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.520]   authoritative documents have not got the "other."
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.000]   It does not make the slightest difference, really, because in any case what he is saying
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.280]   is this.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:34.480]   You must no longer walk as the Gentiles walk, and you are Gentiles, and you once did walk
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.640]   like that.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.080]   So it seems to me that the Authorized translators have certainly caught the pint, and they have
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.960]   caught the spirit.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.840]   What he is really saying is this, look here, you are Gentile Christians, you as Christians,
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.040]   you do not any longer walk as the other Gentiles walk.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.400]   The Gentiles now can be divided into two groups.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.080]   The Gentiles who have become Christians, the Gentiles who have remained where they were,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.660]   the other Gentiles, the non-Christian Gentiles.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.180]   So if you take it as the Gentiles in general or the other Gentiles, it is referring to
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.860]   exactly the same thing.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:17.420]   But the word "other" does again help to bring out this tremendous change that has
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.460]   taken place.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:27.900]   In other words, he is, by every word that he is using, enforcing upon the minds of these
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:34.860]   Ephesian Christians that they are no longer what they once were.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.460]   And this is the place where they rise up and praise God and sing their anthems.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:47.860]   "Whereas I was once blind, now I see, henceforth no longer."
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:54.600]   Thank God for a gospel that enables us to speak like that.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:04.060]   That we can say no longer, henceforth, the new beginning, the new start, the new life.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.080]   Very well then, what are we to do no longer?
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.260]   What are we to refrain from?
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.380]   Well he tells us this.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:20.540]   He gives us an account of how the Gentiles, the other Gentiles, if you like, still walk.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:28.880]   And this is how he puts it, "in the vanity of their mind."
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.700]   Now that is a tremendous phrase.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:44.400]   This is the phrase that introduces the terrible description that the apostle gives here of
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:53.440]   the life of the unregenerate, the life of the pagan world at that time.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.920]   It is, I say, a tremendous and a terrible description.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.080]   You noticed its terms as I read it just now to you.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.320]   Now you cannot read this description without being reminded immediately of what he said
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.160]   at the beginning of the second chapter.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:19.120]   Here you remember he puts it like this, "Ye were he quickened, who were, were, once upon
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.360]   a time, before the gospel came to you, you were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   in time past," you see, he goes on repeating it, "ye walked according to the course of
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.320]   this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.400]   in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:52.160]   past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.880]   and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.480]   Is he then just repeating himself?
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.600]   Well, no, he is not.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.300]   There is a sense, of course, in which he is, but there is a marked difference, one striking
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.000]   point of difference, between what he says there at the beginning of the second chapter
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.600]   and what he says here, and the difference is this.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.560]   There in the second chapter he is giving an objective description of this life of the
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.240]   unregenerate Gentiles, the life of the pagan world.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:34.520]   Here he gives an inward analysis of it, if you like, a psychological analysis of it.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:42.440]   Chapter two, general description, here dissection, analysis, exposure, showing us the source
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.480]   and the fount of it all in a most terrifying manner.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.200]   There is, I take it, no more profound analysis of the unregenerate life anywhere than that
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.240]   which we find here.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:02.120]   And as I say that, I have in my mind that other tremendous passage in the epistle to
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:08.960]   the Romans, chapter 1, beginning at verse 18 and going on to the end of the chapter.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   There is another one.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:17.640]   There is another of these masterly, profound analyses of the life and outlook of that pagan
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   world.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   Read it.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640]   Read every one of these passages.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.680]   There is another one in 1 Corinthians 6, beginning at verse 9.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.600]   They are all full of importance and of significance.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.200]   That seventeenth of Acts, which we read, there is another in the fourteenth of Acts.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:41.680]   Here are the most masterly descriptions of life without Christ that can ever be encountered.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   And here it is really all just in a phrase, "in the vanity of their minds."
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:59.880]   Now I'm pausing with this and emphasizing this, not because it's just a matter of theoretical
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:08.240]   or academic interest, not because I'm interested in the psychology of human nature and in the
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   psychology of behavior.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.720]   They are very fascinating themes, I quite agree, but I'm calling your attention to
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:23.320]   it not because I'm animated by some theoretical interest like that, still less, by some kind
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.240]   of antiquarian interest in going back and reading about those ancient times.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.840]   It's very fascinating, isn't it?
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.320]   Nothing more fascinating.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.360]   Anthropology, it's called.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.200]   And you go back and you study conduct and behavior, civilizations and what's happened
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   to them.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.080]   Well, from the purely intellectual standpoint, there is nothing more fascinating and more
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   fascinating.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.400]   But my dear friends, I'm not pausing with this this morning because I'm animated by
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.200]   any such motives nor ideas.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   I'll tell you why I'm so urgent about this and why I'm holding your attention to it.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:08.640]   Because it seems to me that here we have the perfect description and analysis and explanation
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.320]   of what is increasingly becoming true of life in this modern world in which you and I are
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.800]   living.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:25.520]   The principles which the apostle teaches here are always true.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.320]   And I want to suggest to you this morning that our world is becoming more and more what
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:38.720]   it is for the reason given here and because of the failure of modern men to realize the
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.640]   truth of this.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.420]   So as we look at all this this morning, we are not simply going to look at pagan society
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.120]   in Ephesus nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   We're going to be looking at London today, Paris, New York, any one of them.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   Here it is.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.120]   Here's modern life.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   Here's the modern world.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.640]   You see, these things don't change.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.880]   They're eternal principles.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:12.560]   And therefore I say if we really are concerned about the life of society and about the world,
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.120]   the first thing we have to do is to understand this teaching.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.800]   Those of us who are evangelical are constantly being charged with not being practical.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.920]   "Oh, you see, there you are.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.960]   You spend your time in discussing the scriptures and talking to one another and the great world
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   outside.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   You do nothing about it."
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.640]   Well, what I'm here to say is this.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.120]   You can do nothing about it until you begin to understand this.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.160]   It is this alone that enables one to do anything about it.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.600]   And all organizations that don't start from this not only are failing and have failed,
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.760]   but must inevitably fail.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.640]   That is the tragedy about purely moral societies.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:01.160]   They've been going now, some of them, for nearly a hundred years, and yet in spite of
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.680]   all their activities, the position goes down from bad to worse.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.680]   Why?
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.360]   Well, they've forgotten these principles.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:18.760]   Here, you see, the apostle shows us the origin of that evil kind of life that he describes.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:25.200]   Before he describes the life in detail, he shows us why it ever is that anybody should
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.320]   live such a life.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.480]   Or if you like it in other language, it's this.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:38.520]   What the apostle is asserting here is that you cannot have morality without godliness.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:45.440]   Now, there in a phrase, it seems to me, I have indicated the whole trouble in the last
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.800]   fifty years in particular.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.000]   There are good people in the land who are concerned about morality, they're very concerned
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   about morality.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.200]   Yes, but they're not concerned about godliness.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.960]   You simply cannot have morality, finally, without godliness.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.400]   And the last fifty years has proved that to the very hilt.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.680]   Now, going back a hundred years and more, the great emphasis was upon the godliness,
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.800]   and the morality came out of the godliness.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   But then a generation came which said, "Ah, well, the morality is very good, and it's
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.640]   very essential for the country, but of course we don't want this godliness any longer.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.680]   We no longer believe in the supernatural, we don't believe in miracles, we don't believe
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.560]   that Christ is the Son of God, he was a great moral teacher, and of course we must shed
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.800]   all this godly part of it."
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.440]   And they did so.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.840]   They thought they could preserve their morality without the godliness.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.580]   But you see what's happened?
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.900]   Now you've got education and everything you can provide, if there isn't godliness
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.900]   at the back of it, your morality will collapse.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.860]   And the modern world is just an illustration of this.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:24:00.820]   In other words, the apostle is here concerned, not simply and not only with the fact that
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:08.380]   the Gentiles lived in a given way, he's much more concerned with the reason why they
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.500]   lived like that.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   And that, I say, is still the position with us.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:25.460]   All thinking, good, decent people must be alarmed at what's happening in this country.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.180]   There's a slow but steady decline in morals.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.860]   It must be evident to all.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.220]   And I say all decent living people are tremendously concerned about this.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.740]   But here, I say, is the great and the big question.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.900]   Why is this happening?
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.940]   What can be done about it?
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:53.020]   Now, the most futile and foolish thing of all is just to denounce it.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.980]   That leads nowhere.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.060]   That's the simple and easy thing to do.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.700]   Just as you see it meeting you in the streets and in your newspapers, just to feel a sense
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:08.300]   of disgust, to turn away and say how horrible, how terrible, that's not going to help anybody,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.300]   obviously.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.060]   No, no, the business of the gospel is not simply to denounce.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.580]   It isn't simply to restrain.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.020]   The business of the gospel is to deal with the situation in the only way in which it
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:29.060]   can be dealt with radically, and that is to preach this gospel of regeneration, this power
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:35.740]   of God unto salvation, that can deal even with that, and something even worse than that.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.380]   That's the whole story of the New Testament.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.420]   Very well, then, there, I say, is our overriding reason for pausing with this and going into
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.280]   it so carefully.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.060]   This is the only hope for society.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:57.540]   And let men do what they will, multiply their educational and moral and social organizations.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.620]   They won't touch it.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:06.220]   You can have your T-Total organizations, your morality crusades, and your morality councils,
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:12.220]   and a thousand other things, and you won't touch the situation.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.820]   This kind of thing is in the heart of men, and it's only a message that can deal with
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.260]   the heart of men that is adequate to meet the problem.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.860]   Very well, then, what does he say about it?
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.940]   Well, here it is, he divides it up into three sections.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.300]   Let's look at it.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   In verse 17, he makes a general statement as to the condition.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.700]   There it is, the vanity of their minds.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:44.660]   In verse 18, he tells us the cause of that, the cause of the vanity.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:50.260]   In verse 19, he gives us the consequences of the vanity.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.740]   Now, this morning, we can only look at the general state and condition as he describes
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.740]   it.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:04.420]   Here it is, that he no longer walk, as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.700]   What does he mean by this?
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.140]   Well, as I say, it's a very profound statement.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.380]   What does he mean by the mind?
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:18.540]   It's important we should be clear about this, because our first instinct would be, obviously,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.380]   to regard it as a description of the intellect.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.540]   But he doesn't mean intellect only.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.620]   I'll give you a very good reason for that.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:32.540]   He refers to the intellect in the next verse, the 18th verse, when he talks about the understanding
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.540]   being darkened.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.380]   So, when he says "mind" here, he isn't only thinking of the intellect and the understanding.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.500]   No, "mind" here means something much bigger.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:50.460]   It means the mind with its emotional capabilities included.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.620]   It means thought, will, and susceptibilities.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.860]   It means reason, understanding, conscience, affections.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:05.020]   Indeed, it means the whole soul of man.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.380]   Now, in many other places—I mustn't detain you with this—but in many other places in
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.940]   the Scripture, the term "mind" is used in that sense, as descriptive of the whole
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:24.100]   soul of man—intellect, affections, conscience, will, the entire personality.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.740]   If you like, we can put it like this.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:37.860]   It means their entire outlook upon life, their whole reaction to life, and their way, therefore,
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:43.340]   of living life—the mind, the total personality.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:51.500]   Now, then, what he says about them is this, that these other Gentiles walk in the vanity
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   of their mind.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.540]   What does he mean by "vanity"?
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.220]   Well, let me give you some alternative terms.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:06.140]   Here's what it really means—emptiness, emptiness.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.580]   The Revised Standard Version has got a good word.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:16.140]   It says, "in the futility of their mind,"—utterly empty, absolutely futile.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:22.300]   Indeed, the word the apostle actually used in its origin means this.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.820]   It means that which doesn't lead to the goal.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.680]   It means, therefore, something which is aimless, pointless, lacking direction.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.020]   It doesn't bring you to any goal, and, of course, it leads, in the end, to utter futility.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:45.220]   The whole thing is utterly and absolutely empty.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:54.420]   And that is his description, in general, of the life of the pagan Gentile world.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:04.320]   He says it's living an empty, a futile, a vain life which leads to nothing at all.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.240]   Oh, what a description of the modern world!
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.960]   What a description of what so many regard as real life today—the life of London, especially
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.280]   in its highest circles.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.320]   Life, here it is, they say.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:33.040]   The apostle says it's empty, futile, aimless, utterly vain.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.320]   Is he right?
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.640]   Well, we can certainly justify his description of that ancient world.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.040]   Let me try and show it to you, and apply it to the life of today, and you'll see that
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.800]   it's equally true.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.760]   It's a perfect description of the modern life, apart from Christ.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.720]   It's a life that leads nowhere.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.080]   It never gives any real satisfaction.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.600]   Look at that ancient world.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   Oh, but you say, what about the great philosophers?
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.120]   All right, we'll accept that.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:06.800]   There was that life, and it's a life, as you see, of darkness, an occasional flash.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.520]   But does the flash lead to anything?
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.040]   Did the flash lead to anything?
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:18.100]   There were these great philosophers, and they talked in a very learned manner about truth
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.960]   and goodness and beauty.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.320]   They were their favorite themes, the search for truth, the search for goodness, the search
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.320]   for beauty.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.980]   Goodness, beauty, and truth, put them in any order which you like.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.000]   These wonderful flashes, but what did they lead to?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.440]   That's the question the apostle is asking.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.480]   What is the aim?
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   What is the goal?
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   What is the objective?
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.920]   Did they bring the people anywhere?
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.760]   He says no, pointless, futile, aimless.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   But is he right?
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.840]   Let's test it.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.440]   Where did it bring them in a religious sense?
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.120]   We have seen from their description in Acts 17 that they were very concerned about religion,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.720]   about the gods, and about worship.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.360]   And they talked a great deal about the first cause and the uncaused cause.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.060]   They were seeking for God.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.240]   They put up their temple to the unknown God.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.880]   They were looking for an explanation in a religious sense.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.440]   But what did it lead to?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:25.000]   Well, you read even the secular accounts of those ancient times, and you'll find this.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.840]   They absolutely confirmed the scriptures.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.400]   A large majority of the people were atheists.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.420]   They didn't believe in a God at all.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.200]   The others were pantheists.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:47.280]   That is to say, they believed God was in everything, and everything is God, pantheism.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.960]   And the others were polytheists.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.120]   They believed in a multiplicity of gods, Jupiter, Mars, Mercurius.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.560]   You'll find them mentioned in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.600]   And they built their temples to them, as Acts 17 reminded us.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.040]   Paul says, "As I walked around your great city, I came to the conclusion that you're
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.900]   much too religious.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.840]   Your whole city is cluttered up with temples."
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   Polytheism.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:16.680]   Here they are, the great philosophers, these great men searching after God.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.240]   But where does it all lead to?
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   Futility.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.320]   "They don't know him whom ye ignorantly worship," said Paul to them, "Him declare
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.400]   I unto you."
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.760]   In the vanity of their minds, aimless, futile, it doesn't lead to anything in a religious
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.960]   sense in which they were so interested.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.440]   But what about it more generally, intellectually?
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.360]   Well, the answer is the same.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.320]   They had no satisfaction whatsoever.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.520]   They had no real understanding of men and of life, and of the purpose of life in this
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.240]   world.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.320]   They were very interested in history, in the problem of history.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.600]   This was their view of it.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.880]   They said, "History is a matter of cycles.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.440]   It just goes round and round in cycles.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.120]   There's no advance, there's no direction, there's no goal.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.900]   You seem to be going up, ah yes, but you soon find you're going down the other side.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.200]   You just go round and round in a circuit.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.680]   That was their view of history.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:22.980]   They'd never had this biblical conception of this one great, far-off, divine event to
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.400]   which the whole creation moves.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.040]   No, no, going round and round in cycles.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.400]   Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, expresses it all so perfectly, "Vanity of vanities, that
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.440]   which has been shall be."
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.080]   The rivers go into the sea, the sea's never full.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   Why?
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.840]   Well, it's absorbed again by the sun, and it goes back to the beginning, round and round
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   you go.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   That's history.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.800]   And then, what about death?
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.280]   What was their view of death?
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.480]   These great philosophers, had they any view of death?
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.900]   Well, these were their views of death.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:06.720]   To large numbers, death was just the end, and the grave was the last word.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:16.000]   Others believed in what was called transmigration of souls, a series of reincarnations.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.180]   Others held the view that the state of men beyond death was elusive, vague, indefinite,
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.180]   shadowy.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.600]   Oh, read Greek mythology, and you'll see what I mean.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:34.120]   There they are, as it were, on those rivers, endlessly going about in a kind of gloom and
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:40.700]   darkness, no light, with all their passions still within them and unhappiness.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:47.080]   That's their idea of death and of life, if there is any, beyond death and the grave.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.720]   What were they like morally?
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.960]   Well, complete failure here also, horrible perversions.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:01.000]   Read again that first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, the second section, and there
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.280]   you'll see an account of life as lived in the sewers and the gutters, in a moral sense.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.740]   All the perversions and the foulness conceivable, that's where they were.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:19.160]   Is it surprising that the Apostle describes it all as being vain and empty and futile
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.720]   and aimless?
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.160]   And you see, the leading philosophers were often the leaders in the immorality, as some
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:30.200]   of their greatest philosophers have praised the love of a man for a man as being beyond
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.920]   the love of man for a woman.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.840]   They've justified the perversions philosophically.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.880]   Go and read them for yourselves.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.320]   Before you listen to the modern philosophers who say we don't need Christ, that Plato
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.500]   and Socrates and Aristotle are sufficient, go and read them and you'll find that they
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.800]   justify perversions in their particular way.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.760]   And the result of all this, of course, was that suicide had increased at an alarming
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.620]   rate and was increasing.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.000]   So in spite of all the flashes, the brilliant intellects, and all the interest in goodness,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.060]   beauty, and truth, there was life, meaningless, vain, empty, futile.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.880]   It isn't merely the book of Ecclesiastes who says that.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.960]   It isn't merely Solomon who says that.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.160]   So many centuries before Christ, go back again, I say, to the seventeenth of Acts.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.600]   Look at the learned people in Athens, Stoics and Epicureans, these men who meet together
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.840]   to discuss these things.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.240]   Ah, yes, they met together, you remember, to tell or to hear some new things.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.520]   What's the latest?
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.840]   What's the latest craze, the latest fashion?
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.600]   Not merely in clothing, but in intellect, and in thought, and in ideas, and in philosophy.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.140]   Always rushing after the latest and the last.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.000]   What a confession of futility.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.800]   Not utter emptiness, just going round and round in circles, flashy, exciting, brilliant,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.960]   but in the end, what, nothing.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:08.760]   No understanding of life, no knowledge how to live, no understanding of death, nothing
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.680]   to cheer them beyond death and the grave.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.160]   Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:21.840]   What's the use of anything?
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.720]   That was the life of the ancient pagan world.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:37.800]   In the name of God, I ask you, isn't it a strictly accurate description of life in this
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.280]   modern world without Christ?
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:50.480]   The television life, the cinema life, the drinking, gambling life, the life of society
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:58.200]   high or low, the apparent brilliance, marvel and show, but what is there in it?
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.800]   What is there for your soul?
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.560]   What is there for manhood?
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.720]   What does it tell you about life?
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   What does it lead to?
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   Where are you?
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.600]   What leaves you at the end, empty-handed, with nothing at all, vanity in the vanity
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:17.480]   of their minds, empty, aimless, futile?
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:24.240]   In spite of all our sophistication, in spite of the fact that nearly two thousand years
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:31.840]   have passed since these words were penned by the great apostle, it's as true today as
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.800]   it has ever been.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.520]   I trust that there's no one in this congregation who is fooled and deluded by the gaudy show
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.520]   of it all.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:50.400]   With all its talk about art and its intellectual interests and, I say, its sophistication,
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   what is there in it?
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.400]   Look at them.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.640]   Look at the people, the devotees.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   What have they?
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   It's vain.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   It's empty.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   They have nothing.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.080]   They talk about art for art's sake.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.800]   Is that the way to solve the problem?
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.920]   Is that direction?
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.880]   Does that build up the soul?
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.760]   Does that produce morality?
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.180]   Does that hold out a hope for people who have failed and who've gone down?
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.480]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.320]   They have nothing themselves.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.880]   It's all a make-believe.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   You keep it going.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   It goes round and round.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:25.240]   It's like this satellite, and it can stop at any moment, and the whole civilization collapses,
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.040]   as it so often collapsed in previous history.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.880]   No, no, my friends.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:41.040]   Life without Christ is always empty.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.680]   It's always vain.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   It takes from you, it takes out of you, and it leaves you at the end a disused husk.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:58.360]   It leaves you exhausted, with nothing to lean on, nothing to be proud of, and nothing whatsoever
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.600]   to look forward to.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.000]   Well, what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.880]   He says you are no longer to be controlled and influenced.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:18.520]   By an outlook and by a mentality like that, you have been born again.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.640]   Are you looking back with longing eyes to that kind of life?
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.200]   Does the world appeal to you?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.360]   Is that your conception of living?
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:36.200]   Out upon the suggestion, he says, it's utterly empty and futile, aimless, pointless.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:50.080]   I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you henceforth walk not as the other
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:59.000]   Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, thank God, for ever having opened our eyes
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   to that.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   For the world and all its glittering prizes, yes, says the apostle John, this is the victory
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.120]   that overcometh the world, even our faith.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:20.760]   It is faith, it is the gospel, that opens one's eyes to the emptiness and vanity and
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:27.640]   futility of that world and its mind, its life, and its outlook.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:36.400]   Thank God that in his infinite grace, he has ever caused the beams of his Spirit to shine
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.200]   into our hearts and to give us an understanding.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:48.760]   Thank God, amen.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.680]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
