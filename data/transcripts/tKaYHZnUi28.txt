[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - We're joined again by author and speaker,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Randy Alcorn, sitting in this week for John Piper.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.480]   We're calling it Heaven Week.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.920]   And in Monday's episode, number 359,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440]   Randy, you said this,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.760]   "If there's a new Jerusalem, why not a new Los Angeles?
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.040]   Why not a new Chicago?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.120]   Why not a new Paris?
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.920]   Why not a new London?"
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   End quote.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.840]   So I wanna pick up on this today and ask about travel.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.440]   Will we travel around leisurely
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   and explore the new earth?
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.200]   Assuming there'll be cities,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.600]   will we travel to these cities
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.280]   and will we travel to other planets
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400]   and explore the universe?
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   - Given the reality that the new earth
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.760]   will correspond to the old earth in the same way
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.960]   that our new bodies will correspond to our old bodies,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.400]   a better version of the same,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.640]   but not fundamentally different,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.520]   except in the sense of perfected, glorified,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.360]   always healthy, not subject to death and suffering
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360]   and all of that, because we're no longer under the curse.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.360]   Therefore, I think the natural understanding
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.040]   would be that travel on the new earth
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.280]   in the resurrection would be similar to travel as it is now.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.000]   We can walk.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.760]   The new Jerusalem has streets.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760]   Streets are made for walking.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.560]   They could be also made for riding horses.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.560]   There could be automobiles.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.480]   There could be jet engines and air travel.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.840]   There could be space travel.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.040]   All of these things that in fact,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.800]   there's no reason at all to think there wouldn't be
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.520]   because this is not the new earth,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.000]   what we see in Revelation 21 and 22,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.960]   and for that matter in Isaiah 60 and 65, 66
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.080]   and other new earth passages,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.680]   is that you would expect people to do
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.960]   what they've been able to do, except do it better.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.400]   Our minds will be better.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   Our bodies will be healthier.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.200]   So will we run?
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.120]   We'll probably faster than we've ever been able to run.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   Not getting as tired, of course, will still be finite.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.880]   So some people suggest that they see Jesus
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   in the resurrection appearing suddenly in rooms
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.040]   where the disciples are present.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.480]   And so people speculate, well, maybe we'll be able
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.160]   to do that, transport Star Trek, like, you know,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.000]   without the transporter to another location.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.840]   That's possible, although that's also possible
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.720]   that that's something limited to Jesus,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.280]   that he, the God-man who has a fully human body,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   yet at the same time still has properties of deity
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.160]   that we don't have.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.280]   Maybe he'll be able to do that and we won't,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.200]   but whether we would travel someplace,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   even space travel to explore the universe,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.760]   'cause it's new heavens and new earth.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.360]   There's the old heavens, and we're not just talking about,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.040]   we're not talking primarily about heaven,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.480]   the dwelling place of God.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.160]   We're talking about the physical celestial heavens,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.280]   what we think of as outer space.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.920]   And I remember as a young Christian, as a teenager,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.680]   having a telescope and looking at the great galaxy
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.040]   of Andromeda, 3 million light years away,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.000]   and all these billions and hundreds of billions of stars,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.360]   and thinking, wow, wouldn't it be great someday to go there?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.760]   And then later I became a Christian,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.160]   and I was looking through it, and I thought,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.520]   and I'd read about the new heavens and new earth,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.480]   and I thought, maybe one day I will go there
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.400]   to the praise and glory of God.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.600]   - Fascinating.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.040]   Well, then what about bucket lists?
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.960]   I mean, so many people say, before I die,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.240]   I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Rome, I wanna see London.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.960]   I've never heard anybody put Chicago on their bucket list,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.400]   but assuming they do, if what you're saying is true,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.520]   it makes these bucket list aspirations seem a bit lame.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.360]   - I think the whole concept of a bucket list
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.280]   is entirely understandable for people who believe
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   that this is the only life they will ever live,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.480]   that after they die, they no longer exist,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200]   or who believe that after they die, okay,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.160]   maybe they'll still exist, but they'll be a ghost forever
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.080]   and won't have actual bodies,
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.680]   which means for us as Christians,
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.720]   we should be the last people to think in terms
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.360]   of the bucket list.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.160]   Now, there's a distinguishing between the bucket list
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.760]   and having some things I would like to do
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.800]   with my wife and family.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.720]   Okay, well, that's fine, of course,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.640]   but if it's the bucket list in the sense of,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.040]   hey, I'm gonna kick the bucket,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   and this is my only opportunity as a physical person
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.160]   to do things in a physical world,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280]   that is utterly and completely unbiblical,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.360]   contradicted start to finish from 1 Corinthians 15
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.400]   and every passage that speaks of the resurrection
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.840]   and eternal life.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.680]   - Fascinating.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.800]   There's some food for thought.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.160]   That's especially hope-giving for people like me
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.520]   who cannot afford exotic travel destinations.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.960]   Thank you for that, Randy.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.600]   And for more on this and so many other topics,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.080]   see his best-selling book simply titled "Heaven."
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.640]   Also check out Randy's ministry,
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.680]   Eternal Perspective Ministry online at epm.org.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.200]   And speaking of heaven, perhaps the biggest question
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.240]   is one we haven't covered yet.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.840]   Sex, will there be sex in heaven?
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.160]   We'll put Randy on the spot with that question tomorrow.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.680]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.000]   (whooshing)
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.320]   (whooshing)
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.640]   (whooshing)
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.140]   Thanks for watching.
