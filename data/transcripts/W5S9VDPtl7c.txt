[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060]   What's the purpose of a sermon?
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.600]   What is the preacher trying to accomplish?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.440]   While ministering in Belfast, I heard Pastor John answer this question by saying this,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.880]   "The preacher's job is for people to know God and to find Him more satisfying than food,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.600]   sex, money, sports, or media.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.400]   They're idolaters if they don't."
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.760]   Wow, powerful language about the urgency of the preacher's task.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.920]   The preacher's not a stand-up comedian trying to get laughs.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.680]   He's not a stage performer trying to out-entertain the overstimulated attention span of a Netflix
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.680]   addict.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.800]   He is seeking after eternal things to grab hold of the hearts of his people in order
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.120]   for them to find more joy in the giver than they find joy in the gifts of the giver.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.440]   That's the task of the preacher.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.520]   Here now is the full clip from Ireland.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.880]   Keith Getty is leading a conversation with Pastor John about his recent book on preaching.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   Here's their conversation.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.560]   "Each person at the conference is getting this book, Expository Exaltation.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.600]   You know, I made the joke yesterday.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.720]   I was reading Desiring God on the Lawrence-Denar ferry to the point that every time I see the
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.120]   book, I still smell, you know that sea water and then that kind of smell of the boat?
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   Every time I see the book Desiring God, I still have that smell in my nostrils.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.120]   It's really weird.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.040]   But as I said, it was a unique eye-opener for me because it was both this rich biblical
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.920]   doctrine, but it was just, there was so much of the emotions, the affections, the passion
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.360]   and the outworking of it.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.400]   I've always come alive with Charles Wesley's lyrics because I think they explode theology
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.440]   in a way that opens all the affections.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.680]   Stuart Tynand does the same thing, and this book did that for me.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.080]   Talk to us about Expository Exaltation and preaching and worship and take it away.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:19.560]   If the goal of life, worship, preaching is a people alive to God, knowing God truly,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.280]   loving Him duly, and the fact that those rhyme says something, I work at sentences like that.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.120]   I sit for half an hour trying to think how to say new things.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   I mean, that one will get old.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.320]   It's already old to me, you know, love God truly, or know Him truly, love Him duly.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   It's old to me.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.840]   It might not be old to you, but I work at things like that.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.680]   But that's another topic.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.560]   If that's the goal, my people need to know God, and my people need to have passions for
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.280]   God so that they have more satisfaction in God than food or sex or money or sports or
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   media.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.520]   They're idolaters if they don't, and that's my job.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   So if that's your job, Pastor, what are you going to do?
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.360]   Both of those are impossible.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.980]   The devil is blinding their minds and their hearts are hard stone.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.060]   You can't do anything about that in yourself.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.800]   So preaching is an impossible task, has an impossible goal.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   Miracles have to abound in this room.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.440]   If anything eternal is going to happen.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.000]   So what do you do?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.840]   And those two words, expository exaltation, with a U, not an A, not ex-altation, but ex-altation.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.000]   One is transitive, one is intransitive.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.680]   Remember those words from grammar?
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.600]   No.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.800]   What do they teach in school these days?
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.000]   C.S. Lewis.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.200]   Those two words capture those two goals.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:09.400]   Expository means my job is to see what God has revealed of himself in this book.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.360]   See how he revealed it in the very words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:28.000]   And then to find words and structures of thought to so teach it, elders must be apt to teach,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.360]   didactikos, be really good to meditate on what that adjective means.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.280]   They must be apt to teach so that when he's done, understanding has happened.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:49.160]   Light has gone in the mind and they are better aware of the reality of God in their minds.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   I mean, I'm, here's a little, I don't know where you are on this, but a couple of things
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.200]   about how knowledge relates to worship.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:11.400]   I've watched some people who are so disinclined to theology, so inclined to mystery that they
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:26.840]   try to make God look greater by highlighting what we can't know because he's so great.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.120]   When I read the Bible, which is a very thick book, like mine has what, 1200 pages in it?
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.600]   No, 1060 pages roughly in this book.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.280]   This is not written so that you will praise God for how little you know of him.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280]   It's not.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   I just know it's not.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.720]   God did not waste so many people's time putting so much glorious truth about himself in this
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.960]   book for us to say so little of it, know so little of it, and justify our ignorance by
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.360]   wonders of mystery.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.960]   Baloney.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.760]   The way you come to appreciate mystery is by climbing to the top of the highest mountain
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   you can find and looking over it and seeing, oh, there's another range out there.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   And then climbing that one and looking over the top and saying, oh, there's another range
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   out there.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.240]   And then climbing over that one, that's called theology.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.160]   Those mountain ranges are learning about God from the book.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.200]   So that's my first beef with those who try to create worship out of not knowing.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.680]   Here's another one.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:44.540]   God cannot be glorified by being trusted without reason.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.880]   So many people extol leaps, like leap, just leap into the dark.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.680]   Well, if a man walks up to you on the street and gives you a bag, you don't know him from
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.720]   Adam, and he gives you a bag and he says, "There's $10,000 in cash in here.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.040]   Would you go deposit it at my bank?
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.000]   Here's my bank number.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.320]   Here's my pin.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.880]   Here's the account number.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.080]   Here's everything you need, and I'll see you later."
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.600]   And you look at him and say, "I don't even know you.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.000]   Why would you trust me with this?"
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And he says, "I just do.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.560]   Would you think he's a wonderful person?
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.760]   He's an idiot."
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.160]   And God would say he's an idiot.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.720]   However, if when you say, "I don't even know you," he says, "Well, I know you.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.400]   I've been watching you at work.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.040]   I work down the hall.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.240]   I've tested you.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.040]   I've seen everything you do.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.800]   You are a man of great integrity.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   You put this in the bank.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   I know you will."
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.600]   Now, how do you feel?
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.880]   He's not an idiot.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.920]   He's done his research.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.080]   He knows you.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.320]   He's honoring you.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.840]   That's the way God wants to be honored.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.160]   This book has in it countless reasons for trusting God, countless reasons for trusting
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   God.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.480]   If you try to make much of God without reasons to make much of God, he's not honored.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.520]   You're an idiot.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.000]   So that's another beef I have with people who say, "Leap in the dark."
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.520]   Now what question are we trying to answer?
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.520]   Remind me again.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   [laughter]
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.520]   >> Expository, expulsation.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   >> I'm on expository.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   Let me just shift gears for just a minute.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.880]   And he asked me another question.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   I talked too long.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.800]   So you want people to be knowing God, truly loving him duly.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:54.760]   Well, stocking their minds with ideas is not sufficient for awakening love, affections.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.600]   How does that happen?
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's a miracle.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.520]   I said to Chuck early on, and I've said it all along, we don't worship and then preach.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.600]   We worship with singing and then we worship with preaching.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   You and I are doing the same thing.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.680]   I'm using preaching, you're using singing, and we're both worshiping.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:24.400]   So what does it mean for a pastor to worship as he preaches?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.080]   Telling the truth is half of it.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.960]   Making it visible and plain from the Bible is half of it.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.000]   But if he's not responding with his heart to what he's seen here, he's not preaching
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.200]   and he's not worshiping.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.840]   There got to be evidences in that man's voice, in that man's eyes, in that man's demeanor.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.720]   He believes this.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.360]   He loves this.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.020]   He's afraid of this.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.800]   He's amazed at this.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.920]   Whatever the proper emotions are for this particular psalm or text in Romans, whatever
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:07.600]   those particular appropriate responses of the heart are, he should have them.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.840]   And that's exaltation.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.840]   Expository exaltation.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:18.280]   So really, expository exaltation is an effort to see preaching as an embodiment of what
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.440]   you want out there in the people.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.120]   What you want in the people is people who know God rightly and then feel deeply about
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   what they know about Him.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.200]   Feel appropriately.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   If it's hell, you want them to feel the horror of it.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.720]   If it's lostness, you want them to feel the grief of it.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.200]   If it's heaven, you want them to feel the hope of it.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.880]   If it's a great gift, you want them to feel thankfulness for it.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.000]   If it's some horrible sin they've committed, you want them to feel broken for it.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.240]   All those feelings are worship.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.160]   That's what matters.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.840]   And you've got to embody that, preach that, and then if God please, if God please, it
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.080]   happens in people.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.280]   Incredible.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.000]   That's the high calling of the preacher.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.920]   And you heard a mention of Chuck in this audio clip.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   That's Chuck Stedham, Bethlehem's longtime worship leader who served along Pastor John
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   for many years.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.720]   But boy, that quote really sticks with me.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.200]   The preacher's job is for people to know God and to find more satisfaction in Him than
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.080]   in food, sex, money, sports, or media.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.560]   They're idolaters if they don't.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.160]   That's powerful.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.360]   Well, preachers and wannabe preachers and discerning listeners of sermons, thanks for
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.560]   subscribing to Ask Pastor John in your favorite podcast app or in YouTube.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.860]   We appreciate having you along for the ride.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:43.760]   And next time we field the question, "I am of Calvin," are we forbidden from making such
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   a claim?
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.560]   I am of Calvin.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   This is a good one.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   This is a really good question.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.160]   We'll see you on Friday for that.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   [END]
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   1
