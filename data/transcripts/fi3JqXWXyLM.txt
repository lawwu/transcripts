[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   Today's question comes from a podcast listener named Kathy.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.840]   "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.080]   You recently came to speak at my church in South Carolina and wow, what a blessing it
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.320]   was to me and to our entire church.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.640]   Thank you for your faithful ministry.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.180]   I write because my best friend just told me that she has been wrestling with homosexual
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.000]   desires for years and will now give in to them.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.480]   She recently said this to me, "I'm going to date a girl.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480]   I just am.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.360]   It just feels more right and I just have to try it.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.440]   I've agonized over this for years.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.680]   I didn't ask for this and I'm not guilty or ashamed anymore.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.800]   I've prayed and prayed and prayed and studied and I don't really feel condemnation from
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   God.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.320]   I just feel it from people.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.040]   I feel fine about it, free, unconvicted, and not scared anymore."
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.260]   Those are her words.
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.920]   My friend clearly professes faith and has come to the conclusion that it is okay to
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.720]   pursue this lifestyle, but a strong defensiveness makes me unsure how to best voice my disagreement.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.760]   Pastor John, what would you say to Kathy?
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:20.200]   Kathy, my suggestion is that you go back and review what you know because seeing it in
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.440]   black and white in God's Word strengthens us, gives us guidance for what to do.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.720]   I have in mind Romans 1, 22 to 28.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.160]   All of it's important, but here's the sentence that is most immediately relevant.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:51.920]   Verse 26, Romans 1, "God gave them up to dishonorable passions for their women exchanged natural
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.480]   relations for those that are contrary to nature."
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.820]   That's the most important sentence right now for you and your friend.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.680]   This is very frightening because she is your best friend, you said.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.760]   And it seems to me from what you say that God is doing this very thing in her life,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.400]   giving her up to passions, a terrifying prospect that should make her tremble and you for her.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.260]   So notice two levels of activity in this verse, 26 of Romans 1.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.900]   One level is that God is giving her up to dishonorable passions.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.520]   God gave them up to dishonorable passions, these women.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.400]   There are three implications for your friend here.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.720]   One, God ordinarily restrains sin for millions of people.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:01.000]   He restrains sin, but sometimes in just judgment for their resistance, he stops restraining.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.460]   And this is called giving them up or handing them over to their desires.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:16.200]   So he's just pulled back on your friend's passions for sin, and he's letting her go.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.040]   Second, instead of God being the dominant restraining force now, passions take complete
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.680]   control.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.720]   I hear this over and over in the way you describe the state of her heart.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.080]   Quote is what you say, "I'm going to date a girl.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.760]   I just am.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.600]   It just feels more right.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.000]   I just have to try it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.600]   I don't feel guilty or ashamed anymore.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800]   I don't really feel condemnation from God.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.480]   I just feel it from people.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.560]   I feel just fine about it."
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:02.120]   That's the language of a person who has been given up to feelings, or what Paul calls passions,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.340]   dishonorable passions.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.960]   They are her new God.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   Once the power of feelings and passions had a governor in God's restraining grace.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.000]   Now these passions are like a tsunami.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.240]   They are knocking down every tower of truth, every sign of warning, every barrier to destruction.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.940]   And she is now, it seems, enslaved to her feelings, her passions.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.680]   And there is no slave master in the world that feels more freeing than this one.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.720]   But he's very cruel.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.320]   Here's the third implication of this level one in verse 26.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.280]   This new God that she has, called the passions, Paul says is dishonorable.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.080]   She is in the bondage of dishonorable passions.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.560]   Not only do these passions lead to utterly unnatural and pathetic substitutes for the
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.160]   way God created women, but they turn friends into enemies.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.640]   She says she only feels condemnation from people.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.720]   Feelings are not God.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.840]   It doesn't matter whether the friends really are condemning her.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.040]   All that matters is what she feels.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.600]   That's the way this God enslaves its victims.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.960]   Reality doesn't matter anymore.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.280]   Being condemned is all that matters.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.640]   Whether you love her doesn't matter to her.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.120]   If she feels condemned by what you say, feelings are God.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.140]   Self-justification is right at the heart of these dishonorable passions.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.800]   They are morally superior.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:04.540]   They feel morally superior to her than all the people around her who are now judgmental.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.840]   So they are dishonorable passions in that they take friends speaking truth in love and
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.720]   turn them into enemies.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.080]   I said there are two levels in this verse.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.240]   That was one of them.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.720]   God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.280]   Here's the other one.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.400]   For their women exchange natural relations for those that are contrary to nature.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.840]   So first comes the dishonorable passions, the bondage to the God of feelings, and then
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.720]   comes the action.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:48.920]   First there's dating, then touching, then kissing, then who knows what pathetic, utterly
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:56.480]   hopeless attempts to make the unnatural feel natural.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.960]   The cruel God of feeling will let her succeed for a while, but the end of verse 27 will
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.000]   sooner or later explode with misery.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   It says, "Committing shameless acts and receiving in themselves," she and her girlfriend, "receiving
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.140]   in themselves the due penalty for their error."
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.680]   You can say if you quote that to her, that she feels condemned by you.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   Just realize that feeling is bondage to her new God, and you need to speak.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.000]   God only knows in the short run what that penalty will be.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.960]   All that from Romans 1 is what you would do well to remind yourself of, and it seems to
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.120]   me, Kathy, that perhaps the best thing you can do is somehow draw your friend's attention
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:03.160]   to the powerful role that feelings play in her life right now, that are all out of proportion
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.480]   to the truth and authority of Scripture.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.160]   I'm just going to date this girl.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.560]   I just am.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   It just feels more right.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.480]   I just have to try it.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.120]   I don't feel guilty.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.840]   I don't feel ashamed.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   I don't really feel condemned by God.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.000]   I just feel condemned by people.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.280]   I feel just fine about it.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.480]   Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:36.080]   If there's truly a vestige of submission to the Lordship of Jesus in her, perhaps she
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:43.880]   will see that this is code language for the God of self.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.640]   Perhaps it is not too late for you to sound a wake-up call.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.680]   Don't be afraid of being condemned by her as being judgmental.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.200]   It may be the price you will have to pay for loving her well.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Amen.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.160]   Straightforward word that we all need to find our confidence in the revealed Word of God
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.880]   as an act of love towards others.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.560]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the very honest question, Kathy.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   Appreciate that.

[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.280]   We end the week with an email from a 20-something young man whose health prospect is very bad
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.120]   and it seems that his life will be shortened.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.800]   How does he come to terms with his approaching mortality and not become jaded toward God's
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.520]   sovereign goodness?
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.280]   That is the question on Friday.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.400]   Thanks for listening to this podcast with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
