[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   I was the number one prospect in the country.
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.940]   I think I had $800 a month to spend.
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.180]   I'm glad that they transitioned to paying players.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.900]   It just, if you're getting paid millions of dollars at 17,
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.320]   let guys just go from high school to the league
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.160]   at that point.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.620]   It kind of makes the college concept of you're all
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.840]   in the grind together, it kind of changes that.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.680]   I would get an $1,800 stipend check every single month.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.580]   Now I think about the guy who's getting the automatic deal
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.100]   that doesn't, his second string on the football team,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.960]   he makes $50,000 a year.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.120]   That's different from everybody else.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.940]   The guys who are making the $6 million in basketball,
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.500]   they're probably going to go to the league.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.360]   But the guy who has half a million in his bank
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000]   and is never going to go play football again
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.660]   and has to go work a sales job, that's a hell of a savings,
