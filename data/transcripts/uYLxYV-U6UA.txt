[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620]   And when people who have common interests decide to get together and talk and listen
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.480]   and brainstorm, and I'm yet to do that with good people and not have something really
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.520]   incredible come out of it.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.200]   Not necessarily that day, but looking back five years later and just going, "God, that
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200]   was really worthwhile."
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.000]   A few thoughts in no particular order.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.780]   I would say the first is my recommendations depend a lot on where you are in the arc of
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.600]   your career in life.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:44.900]   If you are in full growth hyperdrive mode and you are trying to build both yourself
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.800]   and your capabilities in a very concentrated way, where you're not necessarily focused
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.340]   on family, you maybe have fewer obligations, then if you're serious, I think many people
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.380]   should consider moving to an area of high density for a period of time.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.920]   It could be three months, it could be six months, it could be longer.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.680]   But putting yourself in a New York or an LA or a San Francisco or Chicago, or as new places
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.120]   develop, I'll give you one you might not expect, say in Ottawa, Canada, where Shopify is based,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.160]   and the presence and growth of Shopify has spawned an entire ecosystem of startups.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.880]   There may be options outside of the usual cast of characters, Pittsburgh and Duolingo,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.540]   similar effect.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.640]   There are more options than people might recognize, but taking a journey and placing yourself
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.360]   in a place where you can be in a very active pinball machine, where you may interact serendipitously
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.320]   with many different people from many different worlds, I think is hard to overstate the value
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   of.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.400]   And my drive and my filtering function, let's just say, because when I first got to the
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.600]   Bay Area, nobody cared about me.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   I was nobody.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.720]   I was driving my mom's used minivan hand-me-down that had the seats stolen out of the back
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   and looked terrible.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.400]   Were you in the South Bay?
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.920]   I was working in San Jose.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.120]   I mean, no disrespect to San Jose, I'm from the South Bay.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.160]   But there's a bleakness to the South Bay.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.560]   There is a little bit of bleakness.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   And then I lived across the street in this tiny apartment, lived across the street from
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.800]   the Jack in the Box in Mountain View.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.920]   So it's not like I was strolling onto the big stage and just blowing people away.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.640]   Oh, I grew up right near Mountain View.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   I'm very familiar.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.840]   I probably skated the curves at that Jack in the Box.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   You probably did, yeah.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.800]   Did you train at the Gold's Gym off Rangestorm?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   I did, actually.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   That was a great gym.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   That was a great gym.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   That was a great gym.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   I don't think it's still there.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.360]   I would go there super late before my writing sessions.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.680]   And it had the benefit of being open really, really late.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.440]   And wow, Rangestorm, I haven't thought about that in a long time.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.760]   So the point is, I also started where a lot of people are starting.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.880]   And what did I do?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.280]   I put myself in a high-density environment.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.800]   Next, what did I do, knowing no one?
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.560]   I started to volunteer at events where they had interesting speakers and interesting people
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.480]   coming to hear those speakers.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.280]   So I put myself in Silicon Valley, and then I began volunteering for groups like S-Base.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.320]   I don't know if it exists anymore, the Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   I think it was.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.880]   Thai, the Indus Entrepreneur, which is a very sort of Indian or Indian-American focused
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.660]   organization that does a lot in the realm of startups.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.120]   And I would carry water, I would take out garbage, I would check name badges, I would
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.280]   check people in.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.600]   Nothing was too low for me.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.320]   And I'll give you guys a tip that will be obvious to some but non-obvious to many.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.560]   When you are volunteering, a lot of folks who volunteer do the absolute bare minimum
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.880]   because they are not getting paid.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.320]   This is not going to get you noticed.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   But it sets a very low bar so that if you volunteer at these events and someone's dropping
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   the ball or there's something happening that needs fixing and you just proactively do it,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.120]   the producers of these events will notice you.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.320]   And this is what happened over time, over a few months.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.920]   And then I got invited to join in on meetings that were planning future events.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.360]   And I eventually got to the point where I was recruiting speakers and able to set the
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   agenda for an entire main event.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.040]   And then that's how I got to know, say, Jack Canfield, who is the co-creator of Chicken
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.160]   Soup for the Soul and many others, who introduced me to my book agent many, many, many, many
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.480]   years later, Jack Canfield.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.200]   But I was a nobody then.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.280]   You have to play the long game, but you can be methodical on how you play that.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.540]   And that is one approach, just as an example, for how to build your network, which snowballs
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.120]   over time.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.900]   Don't hump every VIP's leg within 10 minutes of meeting them.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.900]   Play it cool.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.000]   And gatherings where that person has a lot of demands on them is the last place you want
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   to do that.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.880]   The way you're going to make yourself memorable with people like that is to be very professional,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.500]   always on time, predict what they're going to need or problems they'll run into beforehand
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.200]   and address them before they even think of them and be easy to deal with.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.600]   And people like that, high performers notice these things.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.600]   And they will make note of it.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.920]   The being easy to work with is something that I used to tell my graduate students in post-docs.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.000]   Because the opposite of that, nobody wants.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Right?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Nobody wants that.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Especially in the beginning, like later.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Okay, great.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You're Steve Jobs.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   You want to be difficult here and there or a lot?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   No problem.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Right?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.800]   But in the beginning, that can be a real liability.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.360]   You can make up for that if you're the best in the world.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.080]   But in the very beginning, you probably won't be.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.540]   So try to stack the deck in your favor.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.540]   Volunteering is a shortcut.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.840]   And that would be one way of doing it.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.360]   Another now, especially given the virtual communities that exist.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.720]   So you have subreddits, you have online communities, you have Twitter groups, you have clubhouse,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.240]   you've got a million different options, which can be overwhelming.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.280]   Clubhouse still going?
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   Maybe not.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   I have no idea.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   Oh, no, I don't know.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   I'm not saying it's gone.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.720]   I just, I remember during the pandemic, there were some clubhouse gatherings that hopped
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.040]   on there and, but I've sort of forgotten to get on there.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.560]   The platform affinity is really fickle, which is why I think to the extent possible, if
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   you want to build a world class, and I use that term very deliberately, network in record
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.320]   time just to give you a nice headline, I would say focus on the uncrowded channel, which
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   is in person.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.960]   It's out of fashion.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.320]   It's out of vogue.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.240]   Going to a conference and actually interacting with humans in the hallway, approaching panelists.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.800]   This is another thing that I did.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.300]   I'll give it, I'll give another tip.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.400]   So very early on, I would go to conferences.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.600]   Nobody cared who I was.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.200]   Nobody knew who I was.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   Fine.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.440]   And I would study the panels.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   Let's say I'm going to a big event like South by Southwest.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.200]   And I would, this is what I did in 2007, which was just prior to the first book coming out.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.160]   And I would go to these various in-person events.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.400]   I was focused mostly on events that had the thematic focus of blogs.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.320]   We could come back to that, but blogs were what podcasts were a few years ago.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.480]   They drove incredible traffic, but they were undervalued by mainstream media, undervalued
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.960]   by mainstream publishers, et cetera, which meant there was an arbitrage opportunity in
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.080]   a way.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   And I would pick, say, a handful of panels with topics I thought were super interesting.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.680]   And then the panel would end, and what would happen?
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.160]   The panelists would get rushed by various folks, because many of them were well-known.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.720]   Who was not getting rushed?
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.040]   The moderator.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.800]   I would go straight to the moderator.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   And I would talk to the moderator.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.040]   I'd thank them for the panel.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   I'd be very genuine.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.740]   None of it was made up.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.740]   And talk to them for a bit.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.240]   They would generally ask why I was there, what I was interested in.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.480]   I would mention whatever that happened to be.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.200]   In this case, it was I'm finishing my first book, or I had my first book coming out soon.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.960]   I'm here to hopefully meet people who are involved with A, B, or C.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.680]   And then if we hit it off, which was not true every time, but if it seemed to be going well,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.960]   I would say, I don't know anyone here.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.800]   I'm really orphaned here, making my way through this entire event.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.520]   Is there anyone else here you think I would get along with, who maybe I could buy a drink
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.920]   or a coffee?
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.960]   And the vast majority of the time, they'd be like, oh, yeah, you should meet so-and-so.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.880]   And then I'd get the introduction, and then I would meet that person.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.520]   I would have a genuine interaction with that person.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.760]   And if it made sense, if things were going well, I'd do the same thing.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.000]   Is there anybody else here you think I should just say hi to and get along with?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.840]   Not who I can ask for something.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   And that wasn't deception.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   I was being honest.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.480]   Like someone I could actually vibe with.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.200]   And if so, would you mind making the intro?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Yeah, sure.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   No problem.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.320]   Most people are still my friends.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.480]   And by being surgical in that way, not trying to gather business cards, to use a really
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.200]   antiquated metaphor at this point.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   People still hand them out.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   Yeah, people still hand them out.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.240]   I guess it depends on where you are, especially like Boston.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:41.960]   But rather than trying to collect people as Pokemon cards, developing, say, five, three
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:49.560]   to five deeper relationships through longer conversations at an event, that is what directly
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:56.160]   led ultimately to the hockey stick for the four-hour work week within tech, within specifically
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.000]   San Francisco.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.660]   So those would be a few approaches for building your network when you don't have the ability
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.920]   to just walk up to, say, a Kevin Kelly and have a conversation.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   That came over time.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:17.040]   Yeah, whether or not it's health practices or nutritional practices or at meetings, it
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:24.380]   seems you're oriented toward the uncrowded but very interesting people in spaces.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.320]   But the keyword there I think is uncrowded.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.560]   And of course, the other keyword is interesting, right?
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.080]   I mean, it's not like you're standing in the parking lot talking to whoever happens to
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   be there.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   Although that can be interesting, right?
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.320]   There's a serendipity there.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.940]   And there's always things to learn from people.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.520]   But in terms of career advancement and building new ideas and forging for information, I'm
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.360]   just struck how you've done that over and over.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.000]   And again, thank you for giving us some insight into the process.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Please.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   All right.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Here's another one.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.160]   So I think there's a tendency among people who want to develop their networks or their
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.600]   relationships to be star fuckers.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   Not to get too technical.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.240]   That's a technical term.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.680]   And they want to tell other people they are friends with someone more than they want to
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.880]   develop skills or learn from someone.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.080]   This puts you in a very disadvantaged position.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.160]   Because then that means, all right, you want to become friends with Elon Musk?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.720]   Good luck.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.760]   Or you want to become friends with this A-lister celebrity who everyone else wants to meet?
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   Good luck.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.800]   It's going to be a crowded, bloody path to get there.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.480]   And by the way, they've also certainly developed really attuned defenses against people like
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   you.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.980]   So it's going to be hard.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.320]   They have staff to prevent that from happening.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.680]   They have a phalanx of protectors to prevent you from ever getting to that person.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.120]   On the other hand, if you're approaching it from the standpoint of developing skills,
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.560]   learning and actually becoming potential friends with someone, I'll give you an example.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.280]   You could go after, you want to become better at boxing.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   Let's just make that up.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   All right.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.160]   It's maybe not the greatest example.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   Skiing would be another one.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.320]   But let's stick with boxing just because of the way I'll explain it.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.680]   If you wanted to, say, get personalized lessons from Floyd Mayweather, it can happen.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   Okay.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.000]   Let's go then maybe a step down out of the pro ranks to gold medalist.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Okay.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.480]   If it's a brand new gold medalist, let's just say like Oscar de la Hoya when he was really
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.120]   the golden boy and it just thrashed everyone, still going to be hard.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.840]   What about the silver medalist who just had a bad day when he had that last bout against
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.280]   Oscar de la Hoya potentially, right?
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.480]   From a technical perspective, from a personal connection perspective, you may have more
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   in common with that person or a bronze medalist and they can get you 70, 80, 90% of the way
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   there.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   And by the way, you probably don't have the physical attributes to make it to 100% anyway
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.960]   if you're coming to it this late.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:06.120]   And you could get, in many cases, one-on-one lessons, whether in person or virtually with
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.200]   someone who is of that caliber.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.880]   They're in the same front of the pack as the names I just mentioned, maybe not as famous.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.720]   100 bucks, 200 bucks per hour.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.440]   For a lot of people, that is within reach.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:28.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
