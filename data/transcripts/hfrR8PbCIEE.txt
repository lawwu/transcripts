[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.620]   Welcome, everyone, to the 12th episode
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.340]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.540]   Today, we have a special guest, Larry Suedro.
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.340]   Larry is the chief research officer
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.220]   of Buckingham Strategic Wealth and the author
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.940]   of 17 books on investing.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:38.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.780]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.860]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.500]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.220]   This episode is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.780]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.980]   Today, we have a special guest, my friend, Larry Suedro.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.260]   Larry and I have known each other for many years,
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.780]   and we've had a lot of healthy debates.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.580]   So with no further ado, let's bring Larry in.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.300]   We are pleased today to have Larry Suedro as our guest.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.780]   Welcome, Larry.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.420]   Great to be with you, Rick.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.540]   I'm really excited to have you on the show, Larry.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540]   You and I have known each other for many years,
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.460]   and we've gone back and forth on the forum
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100]   on many different topics.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.420]   And everybody's got a different opinion and different view.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.700]   And you and I have had our days.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.140]   But it's always been very cordial,
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.700]   and I'm really excited to have you with me today.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700]   I'd like to start with you telling us,
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.700]   how did you get involved in this whole investing business?
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.380]   Give us some of your bio.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.580]   My father did something very smart.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.860]   He was a real stock junkie, would follow stocks daily
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.980]   and go to the Merrill Lynch office in the neighborhood
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.500]   and watch the ticker tape.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.980]   And when I was born, he took, I think it was $500 in gifts,
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.860]   and he bought seven different individual stocks for me.
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.100]   And then when I turned 13, we had my bar mitzvah,
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.420]   and we got a little bit more cash.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.500]   And then we sat down together, and we bought one stock.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.060]   Because at that time, while other kids were reading
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.140]   the sports section, I was already
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.660]   following the Wall Street Journal and all these stock
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.620]   prices.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.500]   So then you decided to make it a career,
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.020]   or at least go to school.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.660]   I then went to school.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.940]   My undergraduate degree is from City College, the Business
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.380]   School, Bernard Baruch in Finance and Investing.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.060]   It really was just about the first finance degrees handed
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.060]   out anywhere, because there was no finance theory, as you know,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.180]   until Bill Sharp and others created that CAPM.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.020]   Before that, finance was hidden inside some accounting program
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.140]   or maybe an economics class.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.680]   So Larry, while you were at college,
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.980]   I understand you were a pretty good basketball player.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.420]   Is that true?
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.500]   That depends on your definition of a pretty good basketball
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.980]   player.
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.100]   I was pretty good for my neighborhood, but I was so
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.740]   short.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.460]   When I got to high school, I was 5 foot 1 and 110 pounds,
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.720]   so I couldn't even make my high school basketball team.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.540]   But I grew in my next two years.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.300]   When I graduated high school, I was 5'10" and all of about 140,
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.540]   and I was still only 16.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.860]   And I went to Baruch College, and I
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.020]   made their basketball team.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.500]   You know, it's a D3 school, so it all
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.940]   depends upon your definition.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.260]   Relatively speaking, I was good.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.900]   So basically, you decided not to have a career in basketball,
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.880]   and so you went on and got your master's degree.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.920]   Then went to NYU for my master's.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.480]   And when I got out of school, Wall Street
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.720]   had collapsed, '73, '74, the crisis,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.240]   in addition to which the end of the fixed commission era
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.080]   was over, and many firms were going bankrupt.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.420]   Even Ross Perot lost a fortune trying to buy a brokerage firm.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.640]   And so I ended up taking a job at CBS
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.780]   in their international finance department.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.320]   And then I was going for my PhD in international finance
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.600]   and economics.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   Ultimately, unfortunately, the New York City subway system
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.980]   had gotten so bad and dangerous, I didn't quite finish my PhD,
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.880]   because I had to have my mother even literally drive down
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   from the Bronx to pick me up the last semester.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.980]   It had gotten so dangerous.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.600]   So Larry, I understand from knowing you
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520]   that you actually got not one MBA,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.200]   but you got two MBAs in a way.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.360]   Is that what you're talking about with the PhD?
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.040]   Yeah, in effect.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.720]   So I don't really technically have two MBAs,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.680]   but I have an MBA in finance and investing.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.440]   And then going for my PhD, which would
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.480]   have been in international trade theory and economics,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.440]   I have all of the required courses
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.800]   to have a master's in international finance
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.960]   and economics.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.160]   So in effect, you could say I have two MBAs.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.280]   So let's move on and start talking about your career
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.680]   on Wall Street.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.880]   I really got lucky after that.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's one of those strange things.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.720]   I feel like the Zelig character in Woody Allen's movie,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   where he's inserted in all these major events in history.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.960]   I was involved in, I think, four of the biggest revolutions
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.480]   in finance, just happened to be at the right place
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.800]   in the right time.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   The first was when Brenton Woods broke down.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.020]   All of a sudden, everyone had a deal
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.120]   with floating exchange rates and interest rates going crazy.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I was hired by CBS to be manager of international finance
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and helping them to manage those risks.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.720]   So CBS, you're talking about the entertainment company.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.040]   Yeah, exactly right.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.400]   And there's actually an interesting story
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.320]   behind there, Rick.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.440]   We could divert for a moment.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.040]   So the only reason I interviewed with CBS,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.080]   I was hoping to get a job with a Wall Street firm.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.440]   And I did have one offer from IBM.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.680]   But Wall Street, as I mentioned earlier, was in a sad shape.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.960]   And they could hire somebody with 10 years of experience
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.360]   for about the same, or not much more than some young MBA.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.400]   So I said, I've got to get a job.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.760]   I'm getting married.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.200]   And CBS happened to own the Yankees at that time.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.880]   And so I said, I don't care if I drive a bus.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.200]   I'll see if I can get a job with the Yankee organization.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.640]   So I go to the interview.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.440]   And on my way there, I pick up the newspaper.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.720]   And the headline reads, CBS sells the Yankees.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.040]   So I decided I'm dressed up in my suit anyway.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.120]   I'm on the subway.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.080]   I might as well go.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.680]   I went, and ultimately, I did get a job there.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.280]   And I had a good two years there.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.000]   But then two years later, at the grand old age of 23,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.480]   and with all of two years of experience,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.560]   Citicorp and other banks were getting
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.480]   in the consulting business to help
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.440]   these big multinationals deal with foreign exchange risk.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.240]   And they hired me to be a consultant.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.000]   So I went and joined them.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.280]   This was our new exciting area.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.520]   And then two years later, Citicorp
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.680]   asked me to go set up a whole West Coast Investment
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.560]   Bank at the grand old age of 25.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.000]   I had never run a foreign exchange trading room.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.560]   I had never funded an offshore bank.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.760]   I had never managed more than one person.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.320]   And they sent me out to San Francisco
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.360]   to build an entire operation.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.840]   And a second revolution was occurring around that time.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.040]   Citicorp and Salomon Brothers were leading the way
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.240]   in creating what Buffett ultimately
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.360]   called these weapons of mass financial destruction,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.480]   these derivatives.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.960]   And they were more basic at that time, interest rate floors
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.840]   and ceilings and collars and foreign exchange floors
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.960]   and ceilings and collars to manage these risks.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.840]   And so I was right there with that,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.960]   and even helped design and create
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.760]   some of these derivatives.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.440]   And then 10 years later, my boss at Citicorp
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.240]   left to join Prudential Home Mortgage.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.480]   And that was a whole new revolution in mortgage banking,
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.680]   the first private mortgage-backed securities.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.880]   So I got involved there.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.840]   And with that big revolution, did that for eight years.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.400]   And then we ultimately sold the company.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.960]   And then I was going to look for something to do.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.840]   I thought I'd go teach at something
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.440]   I'd always wanted to do.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.760]   That's why I was originally going for my PhD.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   And friends of mine had started this RIA,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.480]   a registered investment advisory firm in St. Louis.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.200]   And they were good planners doing estate and tax
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.040]   type of work.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.720]   But they didn't really know anything about investing.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.560]   So I thought this would be a great fit.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.600]   I told them I didn't want to have to do anything
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.080]   to do with running the company.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.720]   But I would help set the investment strategy,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   teach them about managing all types of risk.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.960]   So we joined forces.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.760]   And right at that time, as you know,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.160]   the early '90s, Fama and French write their groundbreaking
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.040]   paper.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.200]   And we're now in this three-factor world
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.040]   that changed the way we thought about investing.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.520]   And so that was our fourth revolution
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.120]   that now just happened to be at the right point in time.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.000]   So I view myself as very lucky and had
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.040]   a lot of vast different experiences, which
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.640]   has helped me, I think, be a much better advisor,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.160]   having lived through lots of financial crises.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.680]   So the firm you're talking about is Buckingham Asset Management
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.880]   out of St. Louis.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.040]   Well, now it's called--
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.720]   we changed the name about--
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.480]   I think it's now maybe two years ago.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.840]   It's Buckingham Strategic Wealth,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:29.080]   where just about a $17 billion RIA in now 35 cities.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.600]   And then we have TAMP, which runs both BAM Advisor Services,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.640]   helping other advisors, and a firm called Loring Ward.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.600]   Together, we're about $52 billion, I believe.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   How many advisors are under the TAMP program, Larry?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.120]   Do you have a basic number?
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.960]   Yeah, I can give you some general guidelines.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.160]   At Buckingham, which is BAM Advisor Services,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.040]   about 135 firms around the country with about, I think,
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.000]   $19 billion of assets.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.120]   And Loring Ward has over 1,000 advisors, many of them
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.400]   small broker-dealers who really are nothing more
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.720]   than investment advisors.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.840]   And then they have also about, I think,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.240]   100-plus advisory firms who are really more of the wealth
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.840]   management as well as investment advice.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.760]   And they have, collectively, about $16 or $17 billion.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.400]   So what helped this whole thing grow was your book,
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.920]   your very first book, correct?
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.040]   I mean, I recall when that book came out,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.880]   just before I went to a DFA conference or right after that.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.920]   Yeah, what happened was I got to Buckingham.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.160]   And they had no marketing material at all.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   The firm had just been formed.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.440]   And they had decided, like you did,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.400]   to at least use some of DFA's funds.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.760]   This was a DFA shop, if you will,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.280]   in that it used DFA products exclusively in the early years.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.000]   Today, we use many multiple advisors.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.040]   But DFA clearly was the leader there.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.560]   And I went to a DFA seminar, like you did,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.280]   to learn everything about them.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.360]   And they had, like, three slides at the time
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.960]   to explain what they did.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   So I said, we need to have a brochure to at least tell
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.360]   people what we're all about.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.800]   So I took what I learned in those three days
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.920]   at the dimensional university, if you will,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.740]   and put together a 40-page brochure.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.040]   And then I said, what we really need is a book.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.000]   And I had no intention of writing one.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.400]   So I went and looked in the libraries and bookstores
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.000]   when there actually were bookstores.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.360]   Well, there's still bookstores.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.680]   You have to-- there are still bookstores out there.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.520]   Yeah, there are a few, not many.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.000]   I think we have one left in St. Louis, one major one.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.440]   But at any rate, the only good book
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.040]   I thought out there at that time was "Random Walk Down
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.880]   Wall Street."
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.680]   And all it did really, although it was a great book,
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.600]   it told you the markets were pretty efficient
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.840]   and you should act as if they were.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.240]   But it didn't really tell you what
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.840]   to do with it in the way, like, your book all about index funds
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.000]   did, or my book, or others like John Bogle's book.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.320]   So I said, all right, I've got a 40-page outline.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.680]   Let's see if I can put a book together.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.600]   So I spent the next two years writing a book.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.760]   And when I completed it, we got a publisher who liked it
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.240]   and decided to publish it.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.480]   But the interesting story there was
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.440]   he hated my title, which was "What Wall Street Doesn't Want
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.480]   You to Know."
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.760]   So he said, Larry, go back and give me some other options.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.000]   And I went to a bookstore and came up with, like, 15.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.360]   He didn't really like any of them.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.680]   And he pulled some things together.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.120]   And he came up with the title, "The Only Guide You'll Ever
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.600]   Need to a Winning Investment Strategy."
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.960]   Now, the funny thing about that is, two years later,
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.600]   I wrote my second book.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.480]   And I really liked that first title, "What Wall Street
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.120]   Doesn't Want You to Know."
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.640]   And I was obligated to show it to him,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.680]   the writer of "First Refusal."
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.660]   And he read it and said, Larry, this is great.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.440]   I love that title.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.080]   Same guy who had rejected it two years earlier.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.040]   Editors are strange people.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.660]   I remember when I first saw that book,
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.000]   I can't remember where it was.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.080]   It might have been at one of those bookstores that
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.440]   don't exist anymore.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.600]   And I looked at the title.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.560]   I said, oh, what is this?
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.880]   Whatever it was, "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.380]   Need."
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.760]   I looked at that and go, what the heck is this nonsense?
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.360]   But actually--
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.960]   That wasn't my choice.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.840]   I started reading it.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.960]   And I realized what it was.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   And I said, actually, this is pretty good.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   You've done really well.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.680]   In fact, that book, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.480]   has--
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.840]   you've done a couple of editions now, correct?
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.760]   I did one edition to that seven years later in 2005,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.040]   updated that, and now I've written a total of 17 books,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.600]   which four are originals and three of them are updates.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   I wrote in 2001, I think it was, "Irrational Investing
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.880]   in Irrational Times," which covered 52 investment
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.480]   mistakes.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.840]   I thought people made.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.040]   Several years later, I updated it and had 77 mistakes.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.220]   That book was "Investment Mistakes Even Smart People
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.000]   Make."
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.200]   And then in 2000, I think, '15, I
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.360]   wrote "Reducing the Risk of Black Swans."
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.080]   In '18, we updated that.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.280]   One of the books that I like--
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.720]   in fact, I think it's a great title--
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.120]   is "The Incredible Shrinking Alpha."
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.400]   And I've always been kind of fascinated with--
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.160]   could you talk about that and what's going on out there?
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.560]   The book itself is a nice little short book.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.720]   I got that idea from Bill Bernstein
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   to write these little short books that
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.480]   are really narrowly focused.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.520]   So even a slow reader might read it in maybe three hours.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.020]   So the idea is there are four big themes that
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.360]   are happening that are making it harder and harder
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.840]   for active managers to win.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.120]   The first is that academics, simply really
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.800]   by studying the great active managers
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.880]   and seeing how they beat the market, could they identify,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.400]   was it a unique skill that you can't replicate?
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.120]   Or are they buying certain types of stocks
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.440]   with certain traits or characteristics?
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.040]   And of course, as you well know, Thamer and French
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.960]   summarized a lot of other people's research.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.760]   They didn't discover any of these factors
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.280]   themselves at all.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.880]   But size and value--
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.080]   so prior to the publication of the cross-section of expected
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.680]   stock returns in '92, you could simply say,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.160]   I'm beating the market.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.960]   I'm generating alpha.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.720]   And therefore, get away with charging high fees,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.760]   because alpha is a very scarce resource.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.960]   But after-- you could do it simply
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   by tilting your portfolio to owning more small and value
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.480]   stocks in the market.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.640]   You could claim out performance, and you'd be right.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.440]   But after the publication of that paper
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.120]   and then index funds became available in these asset
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.640]   classes or giving you exposure to these factors,
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.440]   you can't claim out for any more.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.600]   Either regression analysis or attributional analysis
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.680]   will show the alpha was nothing more than due to exposure
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.400]   to these factors.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.320]   And then along comes Mark Carhart, '97.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.640]   He adds a fourth factor, momentum.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.520]   And so once again, alpha gets converted into beta.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.360]   And then really in 2012, Robert Novy-Marks
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.560]   adds profitability, which gets expanded into quality.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:23.000]   And what's important is these conversion of alpha into beta
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   doesn't take anything away from all those great investors
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.680]   like the people from Graham and Doddsville
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.640]   who are buying value stocks that were highly
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.720]   profitable or quality, because they've
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.560]   discovered this 50 or 60 years before the academics.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.320]   But if now we can replicate that and invest
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.560]   in exactly the same types of stocks,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.640]   and there are two good studies showing that Warren Buffett's
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.760]   almost all, but not all, of his stock picking advantages.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.600]   So not counting the benefits from the leverage
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.840]   he gets from his insurance company
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.280]   or not counting the benefit he gets
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.200]   from being able to give Goldman Sachs $10 billion
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.440]   at a much lower price than Goldman could have raised it
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.200]   if they had 30 days to go get the capital.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.960]   But just looking at the public securities that he owned,
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.680]   most of it goes away if you simply
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.440]   bought an index of stocks that look like--
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.760]   meaning they have the same traits and characteristics.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.920]   So that's the first thing.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.360]   Today, every investor can invest in very similar manners.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.200]   So alpha got converted to beta, which is nothing more
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.280]   than exposure to factors.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.200]   So that's the first thing.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.720]   Oh, we're still on the first one.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.960]   You have three others?
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.520]   I got three out there real quick.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.280]   We don't have like a day and a half.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.880]   The others are real quick.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.120]   Maybe you could sum her up a little.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.480]   OK, so turn to the second one, which
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.280]   is in order to beat the market, you
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.400]   have to have victims to exploit.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.040]   70 years ago, 90% of all individual stocks
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.160]   were held directly by individuals
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.800]   in their brokerage accounts.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.120]   Today, that may be closer to 10%.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.000]   90% plus of trading is done by big institutions.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.640]   You just don't have those dumb retail investors
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.080]   who buy stocks that go on to underperform
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.840]   and sell stocks that go on to outperform,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.880]   as the research shows.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.200]   They're exploited by the more sophisticated
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.080]   institutional investors.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   But that pool of victims is shrinking dramatically.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.720]   So today, when Goldman Sachs is trading,
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.240]   it's 90% chance it's SAC Capital or Renaissance Technology
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.400]   on the other side of the trade.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.160]   The third thing is the quality of the competition
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.880]   has gone way up.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.600]   When you and I got out of school, Rick,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.080]   most of the people who were managing money, very few of them
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   were world-class scientists with PhDs in finance,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.040]   unaware of all this academic research.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.480]   Today, everybody managing money is like a rocket scientist.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   DFA's CIO is an aeronautical engineer with a PhD.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.440]   And Andy Berkin, my co-author of that incredible shrinking
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.040]   alpha, PhD in physics.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.280]   So the competition is much tougher.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.240]   And that makes it much harder to outperform those people.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.600]   And the last thing is, 30 years ago or so,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.240]   there was only about $300 billion in hedge funds
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.160]   out there chasing this limited amount of alpha, which
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   is now a smaller pool and less victims to exploit.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.000]   Today, we have 10 times that amount of money.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.840]   So just not a lot of alpha to go around,
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.560]   and the pool is much bigger.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.680]   So 20 years ago, when Charles Ellis wrote his famous book,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.640]   Winning the Losers Game, about 20% of active managers
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   were outperforming on a statistically significant
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.520]   basis.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.080]   Today, several studies show that numbers less than 2%,
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.480]   and that's even before taxes.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.600]   That's pretty lousy odds, which means passive investing
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.360]   is the winner's game.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.480]   Well, I guess I know who that 1% is,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.840]   because I hear it all the time, how they've outperformed.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.080]   So anyway, yeah, I think the fifth one,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.560]   if there's going to be a fifth one,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.000]   is the speed at which information is disseminated now
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.240]   is just so much faster than it used to be.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.560]   Yeah, no question that that's true as well.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.120]   You could add that one, absolutely.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.680]   Let's go ahead and then move on to the current book,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.960]   the 17th book, which is Your Complete Guide
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.920]   to a Successful and Secure Retirement.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.960]   And the forward is by Wade Pfau, good guy to write the forward.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.720]   What motivated you to write this book?
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.800]   Well, I think the key here is that so many people, at least
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   today, are at least beginning to focus on the need
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.600]   to have an investment plan.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.120]   There are lots of good books on investment planning.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.400]   You've yourself written several that really go a long way
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.680]   to helping people build an investment plan.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.840]   But the key is that you can have the perfect investment plan,
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.600]   and it could blow up for reasons that have nothing
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.640]   to do with investing.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.840]   You're a young man.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.960]   You've got three kids, and you don't have enough life
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.560]   insurance.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.880]   You die early.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.680]   I don't care.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.480]   Rick, you've got the perfect investment plan,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.080]   but you don't live long enough to save and invest and watch
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.000]   it grow.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.080]   You're a doctor, perform surgery,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.600]   and you don't have a disability policy.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.320]   And you're getting an accident, and you
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.200]   can't perform surgery anymore.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.840]   You don't have an umbrella policy.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.720]   You get in a car accident.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.760]   You don't have long-term care, and you have dementia.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.080]   There's all kinds of risks related to elder abuse.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.240]   We even have a chapter on that.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.800]   And there are so many ways that investors
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.280]   can make mistakes that lower their odds of success,
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.400]   like asset location, holding the right assets
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.160]   but in the wrong location, taking Social Security way
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.120]   too early, not using annuities where they are appropriate,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.160]   and buying the right kind.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.440]   So what I wanted to do was to create a book that
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.440]   looked at all of those things.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.600]   And the first chapter is maybe the most important one,
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.320]   which is why we put it there, which
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.520]   has nothing to do with investing or other financial issues,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.800]   but having a plan to have a meaningful and successful life
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.160]   in retirement.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.840]   And that's so important.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.360]   One, the highest suicide cohort in the United States,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.720]   I would have guessed might be teenage girls.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.320]   Unfortunately, I lost a sister at a very young age to that.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.160]   But it's retired men, because they've
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.520]   lost the meaning and their purpose and sense
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.200]   of fulfillment and social connections, which
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.520]   they typically get at work.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.200]   And the highest divorce cohort is
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.320]   what's called silver divorce.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.120]   And my line about that is, well, I married you for better
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.960]   or worse, but not for lunch.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.040]   And you have no plan to have a meaningful life.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.120]   Did you come up with that?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.640]   I married you for better or worse, but not for lunch?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.920]   I don't know if I actually can take credit for that,
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.400]   but I steal it and use it all the time.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.040]   Great.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.880]   I'd like to add one more thing to your threat of elder
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.720]   financial abuse chapter.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.640]   I wrote an article for Forbes about it.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.280]   I called that article, "You May Never See Your Grandchildren
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.440]   Again," because I was invited to a local dinner
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.160]   seminar put on by a local advisor.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.400]   I live in an over 55 community out here near Austin.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.600]   And we just get hit with all of these dinner seminar things.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   Anyway, I decided to go to this one.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.640]   There's no word of a lie.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.360]   The advisor must have said three times,
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.200]   if you want to see your grandchildren again,
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.560]   talking to the woman in the audience,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.080]   you want to come and see me, because I
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.680]   have had so many widows who didn't do it the right way
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.960]   when their husbands died.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.560]   And by the time they came to see me,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.160]   they didn't have any money, and they never
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.240]   got to see their grandchildren again after that.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.440]   So if you ever want to see your grandchildren again,
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.800]   you need to come and talk with me.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.520]   And the guy was a snake, because he
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.360]   was selling all kinds of high commission annuities
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.080]   and all this other stuff.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.800]   I mean, he had a management fee that was something like 2%.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.720]   He was a real snake.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.400]   But this is what he was pitching to the people in this community.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.040]   You know, we see that, unfortunately, all the time.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.640]   Literally, you and I agree on lots of things,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.280]   even though we've had some good debates about most of the stuff
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.000]   that's relatively minor.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.320]   But this is a perfect one where I know we agree.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   I literally don't know how these people look themselves
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.160]   in the mirror when they get up in the morning
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.080]   and live with themselves.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   And unfortunately, it's not going to change.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.840]   Tell me a few other highlights of the book,
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.920]   and then we're going to move on to some questions
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.280]   by the Bogleheads.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.080]   Well, yeah, a couple of things I think are important.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   One, I think we really cover an incredibly broad spectrum.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.120]   I don't believe there is any book that
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.440]   is as comprehensive as this.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.760]   There are other good books on estate planning or investing,
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.680]   but none is comprehensive.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.520]   Second thing I want to highlight is
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.440]   the book is filled with lists and checklists,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.520]   action items for people to do.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.760]   So I believe literally everyone who
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.520]   reads the book will walk away with some things
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.760]   that they can focus on.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.120]   And I'll just touch on in the introduction,
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.280]   we talk about what I call the four horsemen of the retirement
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.240]   apocalypse.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.560]   And I can take credit for that term.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   And the four horsemen here that are creating real threats
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.480]   to successful retirements are first equity valuations,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.840]   at least in the US, are much higher
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.720]   than they have been historically.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.560]   And bond yields are much lower.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.120]   And unfortunately, so many people look at the past
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.840]   and automatically project them in the future.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.600]   I meant to that.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.240]   I tell you, the--
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   and they're related, too.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.200]   I mean, the high equity valuations that we have
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.360]   is related to the low bond yield.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.880]   The Fed, unfortunately, pushed a lot of people
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.920]   to take more risk because they can't live on that 2% bond
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.600]   yield.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.760]   But here's an amazing stat.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.960]   From 1982 through now, a typical 60/40 S&P 500
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.280]   intermediate treasury portfolio has earned 10%.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:48.780]   Amazing.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.720]   Most financial economists today would put that number maybe
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.320]   in the area of 5.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.960]   I put it at like 4 and 1/2.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.080]   Well, I won't disagree.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.280]   And that's a real problem.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.640]   If you're counting on 10 or anything near there,
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.760]   your plan is likely to blow up.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.640]   So those are the first two horsemen.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   The third is we're now living much longer.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   When I was growing up, even as a teenager,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.440]   I almost knew nobody who was 75 years old.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.400]   And today, 65-year-old couple second to die
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.920]   is almost 25 years.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.000]   And that means half the time, someone's going to live longer.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.200]   So you really need to plan for at least 30 years, not 10
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.360]   or 15.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.440]   So you got higher valuations, lower bond yields,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.800]   lower expected returns, and the money
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.080]   has to last a lot longer.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.120]   Fourth thing is the good news, of course, we're living longer.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.480]   The bad news is the longer you live,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.200]   the increased risk of dementia and long-term care
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.640]   needs, which could be very expensive.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.200]   And that's where the risk to many people are.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.840]   So that's got to be dealt with.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   We do have a chapter on long-term care,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.760]   as well as annuities to help deal with that.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.880]   And there is even a fifth horseman,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.480]   which I mentioned, which is the risk of Social Security.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.640]   If Congress doesn't act, and this
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.280]   looks like another do-nothing Congress,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.440]   the estimate is in about 13 years,
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.320]   they'll only be able to pay out about 70%.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.560]   It's not going bankrupt.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.120]   So my advice is being conservative.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.680]   Starting in 2032 or so, you should only
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.000]   plan on getting 70% of Social Security benefits.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.880]   But then I remember that you and I, when we were growing up--
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.040]   I say we were growing up-- when we were 30 or 40 years old,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.100]   I think we were saying we weren't
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.300]   going to get anything either.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.000]   But we're going to get something.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.640]   The question is, you may not get as much as you
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.920]   thought you were going to get.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.960]   Exactly.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.800]   And there are simple solutions here.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.520]   Raise the amount of income that's taxed.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.600]   You can raise the rate slightly.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.680]   Those are two simple solutions that they could do.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.360]   And then, of course, you can raise the age
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.880]   that you're retired.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.360]   You can't expect to get 30 years of payments.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.320]   It was designed maybe when people live 5 to 10 years.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.800]   And so you're living longer, and people are working longer.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:27.160]   Most of my friends are working till 68, 70, 72 now.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.640]   They don't want to retire to, quote, "nothing," right?
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.440]   Well, I agree.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.800]   In fact, this is my encore career
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.880]   doing what I'm doing now.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.960]   As you know, I sold my company a couple of years ago.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.840]   And now I'm just doing consulting
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.880]   and doing hourly advising.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.280]   And it's an encore career.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.940]   But I admit, I like the idea of continuing
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.040]   to get paid enough money so that I can pay all of my bills
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.320]   and travel and such and not have to touch my savings.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.440]   The encore career is a good idea,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.280]   and a lot of people are probably going to do that if they can.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.800]   Yeah, and I would add one other thing on top
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.160]   of the points you made, which are critical,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.800]   is it gives you that social connection.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.240]   You stay engaged.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.680]   And I'm sure you're just like me.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.800]   You get great psychological joy out
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.680]   of helping people knowing you're increasing
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.080]   their odds of being them able to achieve
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.720]   their life and financial goals by putting them
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.640]   on the right path.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.320]   Well, it's interesting from where we sit,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.880]   because we get to pair into people's lives
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.600]   like most people can't.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.240]   There's an old joke that if you really
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.620]   want to get to know someone, you either marry them
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.400]   or manage their money.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.120]   And it's true.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.560]   I mean, I'm talking with three or four people a day
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.720]   and really getting to know all about them
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.160]   and all about their finances and all
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.480]   about how they're planning things.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.920]   And one thing you brought up, and I want to reiterate it,
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.520]   is this idea of disability insurance.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.440]   I see a real, real lack of disability insurance
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.840]   out there, particularly among physicians
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.280]   and among people who are high wage earners.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.880]   For some reason, it sort of passed them by.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.160]   And I asked them, do you have disability?
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.240]   And they're making $500,000 a year.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.120]   And they say, well, I think I've got a policy.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.480]   I think I've got a policy.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.320]   And I asked them, well, what would you make?
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.920]   And it turns out that somebody who's making $500,000 a year
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.080]   and has $300,000 a year in bills because they bought a new house
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.880]   and they want to send their kids to college
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.480]   and this and that and the other, if they became disabled
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.320]   and they couldn't work, they would be making about $100,000
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.440]   a year.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.600]   That's a problem.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.560]   Yeah, and it's a Pascal's wager bet, right?
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.200]   It's one of those things.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.280]   It doesn't matter what you think the odds of your being
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.600]   disabled are, you're likely not willing to live
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.080]   with the consequences of being disabled
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.360]   without disability insurance.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.160]   And I would add the other thing I
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.880]   would imagine you also look at, one of the first questions
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.760]   I ask somebody, because it's the cheapest insurance there is,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.720]   and everybody should have it, is an umbrella policy.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.760]   You can get a million bucks for something, I think,
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.400]   in the $300 to $400 range.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.480]   And you should have at least as much, I think,
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   as your financial assets, and maybe even most people up
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.520]   to about $10 million, because the lawsuits today
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.840]   are paying out such large amounts on claims.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.720]   I personally carry a $10 million umbrella policy.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.180]   Mine isn't quite that large, Larry,
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.600]   but I haven't written 17 books.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.440]   Well, you and I know, you don't get rich writing books.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.120]   I've got to move into the next area of our interview.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   You're very popular with the Boglehead community.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.520]   I've always been for 20 years.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.980]   Well, hopefully, we're going to get you out to a conference
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.080]   in one of these days.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.640]   When your name comes up, and you're
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   active on the Boglehead site, and a lot of people
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.480]   have read your books.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.060]   And so when I went on the Boglehead,
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.240]   and I announced that I was going to be interviewing you,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.440]   I got literally dozens and dozens and dozens of questions
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.160]   that people wanted to ask.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.300]   So I have a printout here of several pages long of questions.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.720]   Now, we're not going to be able to get to every question,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.120]   but I want to get to as many as we can.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.600]   So here we go with the first question.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.360]   A Boglehead asked, what your thoughts are on the new Vanguard
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.920]   factor funds, and particularly the Vanguard multi-factor
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.640]   funds?
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.520]   These came out a little later on,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.600]   and they don't seem to be publicized that much
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.520]   by Vanguard.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.000]   But do you think that the way they're doing it
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.080]   is adequate?
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.880]   Well, I think a short answer would be this.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.960]   Number one, virtually anything Vanguard does
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.960]   is likely to be done very well.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.520]   One, highly ethical people.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.480]   And number two, they do have good researchers there.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.040]   Their funds, we did take a look at them, so I can comment.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.480]   They're well-designed, and they're cheap.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.640]   So those are all Vanguard traits, if you will.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.960]   So somebody looking to add a little bit
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.040]   of further diversification in their portfolios
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.920]   away from a market-like portfolio,
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.080]   this is certainly worth looking into.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.060]   The only negative, if you want to call it that,
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.920]   is they tend to have very low exposures
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.400]   to each of the factors.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.840]   They're not a deep exposure to them.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.040]   So one of the things you have to be careful about,
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.320]   people often, especially bogleheads,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.840]   focus on expense ratios.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.240]   I think the right way to focus on it
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.040]   is the expense ratio relative to the amount of exposure
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.000]   to these factors you're getting.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.600]   So for argument's sake, just to make it simple,
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.720]   if you thought all of the factors
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.000]   would get you 2% a year, and you're
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.960]   getting 10% exposure to it, well, you're
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.320]   getting 20 basis points.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.280]   And if you're paying 8% for it, and their implementation costs,
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.080]   you're probably not getting very much of any benefit.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.920]   On the other hand, if you paid 20% for 30%, you're way ahead.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   Yeah, I call what you just talked about the cost
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.800]   per unit of risk.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.840]   You could pay a lot of money for a small-cap value fund that
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.680]   basically has mostly beta and doesn't have much small cap
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.000]   and not much value.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.800]   Exactly.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.000]   You have to look at that.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.080]   I'll give one very brief example.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.920]   We used to use DFA Small Value Fund.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.800]   We switched in 2011 to Bridgeway because it was much smaller
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.200]   and deeper value.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.720]   It was 8 basis points more, but the market cap
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.400]   was half the size of DFA.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.560]   And the price-to-book and earnings and cash flow
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.760]   were much lower.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:08.480]   We estimated if the factors delivered what we expected,
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.360]   it would outperform by about 60 basis points.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.400]   We were willing to pay 8 to get 60.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.680]   I have a couple of people who asked about risk parity.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.440]   So I'll let you go ahead and explain quickly
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.760]   what risk parity is, and you can give your opinion.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.240]   Right.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.520]   So here's the basic concept of risk parity
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.880]   or why people should at least be thinking about it.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.760]   So a typical 60/40 portfolio, when
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.240]   I ask people if you have $1 million, $600,000 in stocks,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.880]   and $400,000 in bonds, how much of your risk--
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.480]   not money, but risk-- is in stocks, they'll say 60%.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.760]   But that's not true because stocks
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.080]   are so much more riskier than, say, a five-year treasury.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.160]   They're about four times as volatile.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   So about 85% of your risk in that portfolio
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.120]   is in your equities.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   If you believe that, as you and I, I think,
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.200]   can agree, that markets are pretty highly efficient,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.320]   then you should also believe it has to follow
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:20.160]   that all risky assets have very similar risk-adjusted returns.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.560]   So small caps are riskier than large caps,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.160]   so they should have higher expected returns.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.120]   It doesn't make them a better investment.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.520]   It means they're riskier.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.480]   And once you adjust for the risk,
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.880]   their risk-adjusted return should be similar.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.160]   Risk-adjusted returns are not just the Sharpe ratio.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.200]   You have to think about liquidity and trading costs,
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.120]   et cetera.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.240]   But that's the idea.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.800]   So risk parity, the idea is to diversify
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.000]   across as many unique sources of risk
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.880]   as you can identify that provide premiums that
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.280]   have evidence, using my terms from my factor book,
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.040]   that they're persistent over very long periods of time.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.480]   They're pervasive all over the globe.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.840]   They're robust to various definitions,
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.600]   so you don't have likely data mining.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.000]   So for value, PE, cash flow, EBITDA, all work.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.280]   Momentum, you can have different formation and holding periods.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.120]   They work.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.440]   Has to survive transactions costs,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.320]   meaning it's implementable.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.160]   You don't want a 5% premium in micro caps.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.000]   And of course, you're 6% to capture it.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.640]   And lastly, it has to have intuitive reasons for you
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.520]   to believe it will likely persist.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.240]   The idea of risk parity, then, is
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.040]   to put equal amounts of money in every one of the assets
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.160]   that you could identify, so you end up
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.240]   having an equal amount of risk.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.880]   So that's the concept.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.160]   Directionally, that makes perfect sense and logic.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.520]   I would say, however, I don't have the same degree
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:03.120]   of confidence in all of these factors or asset classes.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.640]   So I want to put more of my weight in my portfolio
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.800]   on things I have the most confidence in.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.440]   Those are things that are risk-based solutions, things
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.920]   like small in value, where momentum is purely behavioral.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.240]   So I don't want to ignore it because it
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.160]   has a lot of evidence that meet that criteria.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.680]   So I just try to eliminate negative momentum,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.800]   as an example.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.760]   And then I invest in other assets,
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.160]   like reinsurance, quality, profitability, et cetera,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.760]   putting more weight on the ones I have the most confidence in
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.640]   and less weight in the others.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.280]   So each person should decide how much confidence
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.560]   do they have in each one, and then diversify.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.160]   Logically, bottom line is risk parity is a good general idea.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.240]   But I think it's not the right answer.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.720]   You should not be looking to have
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.840]   exactly the same amount of risk in each of your assets.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.760]   You should put more weight on the ones
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.080]   you personally have the most confidence in that
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.160]   will deliver above-market returns
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.520]   or have unique risks that are rewarding.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.960]   Talking about risk, one of the Bogleheads
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:24.080]   asks, isn't a simple portfolio of a few index funds
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.520]   still the best way for the general public
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.000]   to grab their fair share of market return
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.480]   without breaking the bank on expenses?
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.840]   And if not, what can the general public
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:40.240]   do to try to take advantage of some of your ideas?
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.360]   First of all, I think you and I certainly
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:49.440]   can agree that a simple two-fund portfolio of a total US
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.760]   and a total international to the global market cap, which today
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.480]   is actually roughly 50/50, you want to tilt a little bit
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.040]   or, as Cliff Asness would say, sin a little bit.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.840]   So you want to have a little more US
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.320]   or a little more international.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.440]   That's fine.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.760]   And that's a very low-cost, tax-efficient way to do it.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   The problem is you have all of your risk
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.800]   then in market beta, where correlations go very high,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.680]   especially in crises.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.480]   But even not in crises, you can go through very long periods.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.840]   We happen to be one now.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.560]   For the last 10 years, US small value
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.840]   has performed relatively poorly.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.000]   From '66 to '82, on the other hand,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.960]   a total US market fund would have underperformed
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.360]   totally riskless one-month Treasury bills for 17 years
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.480]   and underperformed small value by over 1,000%.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   To me, the right answer is you want
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:50.760]   to be low-cost, tax-efficient, and give yourself
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.920]   the chance to stay disciplined.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.600]   And the right portfolio is the one
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.000]   that you are most likely to stay disciplined.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.760]   So no matter what you invest in, whether it's
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.920]   total stock market funds, there are
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.120]   three periods where US total market has underperformed
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.360]   totally riskless T-bills for at least 13 years.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.920]   That's cumulative 45 of the last 90 years.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.200]   Obviously, in the other 45 years,
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.680]   it dramatically outperformed.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.960]   We don't know which period you're going to get.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.840]   Maybe the next 15 years, and you retire tomorrow,
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:32.000]   is one of those where US market beta does poorly.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.080]   So to me, if you are able to deal with this tracking
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.160]   variance issue, that once you diversify,
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.400]   you know you're not going to look like the market,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.280]   and you have to live with that.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.640]   If you can't do that, well, then you
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.200]   shouldn't tilt into smaller value or own reinsurance
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.440]   or anything else.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.680]   Because every risk asset guaranteed
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.680]   will go through long periods of underperformance.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.400]   There is no such asset that doesn't.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.760]   And that has to be the case, or there
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.640]   would be no risk for the long-term investor.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.400]   On the other hand, if you do diversify--
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.440]   and diversification is difficult,
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.720]   because you're always going to own some things that
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.040]   are doing poorly, which is why so few people are good at it--
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.520]   then you increase your odds of getting
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.400]   a return that's expected.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.640]   You're narrowing the dispersion of your outcomes,
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.360]   because you won't own all of the best,
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.160]   and you won't own all of the worst, if you will.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.240]   And that actually goes a long way
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.680]   to giving you a better chance of getting
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.960]   the mean return expected out of a potential dispersion.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.240]   When you run money Carlo analysis,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.040]   diversified across asset classes or factors,
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.600]   unique sources of risk, will come up
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.320]   with much higher odds of success.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.440]   But it doesn't do you any good if you can't stay disciplined.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.600]   So don't do it if you're not going
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.560]   to be able to stay the course.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.680]   And that means rebalancing along the way.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.160]   I call it a lifelong investment strategy,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.840]   because you really need to be in the thing lifelong.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.640]   You've got to believe in it so strongly
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.680]   that you're willing to stick with it
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.920]   for the rest of your life.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.240]   If you don't, odds are the time you jump out
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.560]   is going to be the worst time.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.600]   And then looking backwards, you should have never
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.520]   done it to begin with.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.880]   I completely agree.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.000]   Exactly right.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.160]   So let's get on to something that I
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.280]   think is really important right now.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.160]   It's called recency bias.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.120]   And somebody asks, do you think that investors
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.760]   are suffering from recency bias with the stock market going up
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   over the last 10 years?
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:47.640]   Well, we know recency bias is prevalent to all investors,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.920]   not just individuals.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.280]   We spend more of our time managing people
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.080]   than we do managing money.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.440]   Whatever is done well recently, they want to buy.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.320]   I remember-- well, today, everyone,
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.080]   why we own international emerging markets
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.640]   are a small value.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.400]   If you just go back to 2007 at the end of that year period,
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.720]   the prior five years, S&P had a great period.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.560]   It was up 82%.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.440]   EFI was up 162, call it double.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.960]   And the DFA Emerging Market Fund was up 565%.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.480]   And money was flowing in like crazy,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.080]   as I'm sure you remember, into emerging markets.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.600]   I do.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.040]   It was all the rage.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:34.520]   Yep.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.440]   And then, of course, the reverse happens and then floods out.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.640]   So the problem is people only buy after the good returns,
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.360]   and they panic and sell.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.680]   So they hurt themselves.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.760]   The best thing, as you said, and I completely agree,
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.360]   you've got to have this kind of lifelong approach.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.640]   And you've got to stick with it.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.360]   Now people are fleeing emerging markets.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.400]   They're fleeing small value.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.680]   And by the way, I'll point out one of the techniques
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.640]   I use when I talk to people.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.120]   I point out value went through exactly the same period, even
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:12.520]   much worse performance, just not as long, in the late '90s.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.280]   And Buffett, in many cases, is being ridiculed in the media
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.400]   as the time has passed him by.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.640]   In the new dot-com era, you got to own Intel and all
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.120]   of these kinds of companies.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.160]   But it is the same thing that happened in parts of the '80s
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.200]   when digital equipment and those stocks were there.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.800]   And we're seeing now the same thing.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.000]   Buffett didn't give up on value in the '90s.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.840]   And then the next eight years were the biggest value premium
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.360]   ever by far.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.680]   And right now, value relative to growth valuations
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   are pretty much almost exactly where they were in '99.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.480]   Now I'm not making any prediction.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.200]   My crystal ball is cloudy.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.800]   But valuations look really stretched.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.720]   And value looks really cheap.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.040]   And I ask people, what do you know that Warren Buffett
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.600]   doesn't know?
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.360]   He's not giving up on cheap value stocks.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.680]   Why should you?
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.600]   Some people you can't protect from themselves.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.400]   Larry, question from a Boglehead having
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.600]   to do with the 4% rule.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.640]   And I'm referring to the idea that it's
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.560]   safe to withdraw 4% of your portfolio.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   Is there now a 3% rule instead of the 4% rule?
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.160]   Here's the way I would answer that.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.960]   First of all, I don't believe people
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:35.200]   should use that as anything more than a guideline, number one.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.680]   But the 4% rule is based on the historical evidence
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.560]   when valuations, of course, were much lower
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.080]   and expected returns much higher.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.200]   And bond yields were much higher,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.240]   which meant yields were much higher.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:53.000]   Today, if you ran a Monte Carlo simulation using
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.800]   the same type of life expectancy and withdrawal rates,
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.660]   but now just projecting returns based on today's valuations,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:07.240]   you get a number closer to about 3.3% to be safe.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.480]   I think withdrawal rates like 4% or 3%
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.160]   or whatever you're going to use are fine
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.720]   when you're in your 40s and you're still working
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.960]   and you're looking toward retiring
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.920]   in your 60s or mid-60s.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.200]   And when you're projecting out how much rate of return
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.680]   you might get on your portfolio and how much money
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.800]   you need to accumulate to get to a certain point.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.680]   And then from there, if you took 4% or 3%,
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.000]   how much would that give you?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.080]   I think that's where the 3% or 4% safe withdrawal rate works.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.000]   But in retirement, when you're actually
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   getting ready to retire, the withdrawal rate
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.640]   is the amount of cash flow that the portfolio creates, to me.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.920]   So we're looking at dividends and interest income.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.640]   And what amount of dividend and interest income
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.880]   and what amount of Social Security are you getting?
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.080]   And how much cash flow are you getting in?
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.800]   This is your sustainable amount.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.920]   This is the sustainable amount that you can get out
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.000]   of the portfolio.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.720]   If you go more than that, then you
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.400]   start cutting into principal.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.560]   Then it becomes not as sustainable.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.240]   So I think that this 3% or 4% withdrawal rate
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.480]   is good for planning purposes, long-term, long-range planning
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:17.960]   purposes.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.080]   But you actually get into retirement, as you said.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.920]   It's sort of year by year.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.040]   And you're budgeting.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.520]   And what are you going to do?
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.040]   And I know you use Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.680]   I don't particularly use that.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   But I think we all get to the same spot.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.800]   When you're actually in it and you're actually
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.560]   taking money out of the portfolio,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.920]   you've got cash flow coming in.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.380]   And then you've got things that are
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.080]   occurring on a year-over-year basis that
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.200]   might need to be looked at as they occur.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.400]   I'll just add quickly, Rick.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.000]   One, I certainly agree with the first half
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.640]   of completely what you're saying.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.240]   3% or 4% reasonable for long-term planning.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:02.080]   In retirement, the only thing I would add to what you said
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.120]   is not drawing any principle, I think,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.680]   becomes way too conservative.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.200]   Because we know we are not going to live forever.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.760]   So you can certainly dip into some amount of principle.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.480]   Unless you have that, I'm going to want to bequeath desire
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.120]   there.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.680]   So we don't want people not to be able to enjoy their life
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.520]   and spend money.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.360]   So you want to at least consider you
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.600]   can dip into that portfolio a little bit every year,
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.160]   and just depending upon how far you're along.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.000]   Certainly, at age 90, someone maybe
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.360]   got a 10-more-year horizon or most,
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.400]   they should be able to take out a lot more than 4%
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.000]   of their portfolio, right?
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.560]   Absolutely.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.200]   Just like exactly what the required minimum distributions
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.520]   are on a retirement account, for sure.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.500]   Now, if you could only spend it at age 90,
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.680]   that would be better, right?
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.180]   Right.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.200]   That's the question, yes.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.160]   All right.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.920]   Somebody is asking, what about if you're
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   in a situation where you have nobody who can take care
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.200]   of your affairs in retirement?
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.240]   You're unable to handle your own affairs.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.600]   You're unable to manage your own portfolio at some point.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.240]   What do you suggest for a person or a couple who
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.680]   is in that situation where there's nobody who can actually
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.640]   come in and help them and take over for them?
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.160]   What suggestions do you have for those folks?
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.760]   Yeah, well, first, I'm going to broaden the question
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.160]   because I think it's going to be helpful for every Boglehead.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.440]   Just in my own particular case, we're all living longer.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.080]   The risks of the dementia go up.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.080]   And as we age, we become more susceptible.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.640]   The con artists are most likely to prey on the elderly.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.880]   And they know women are more susceptible.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.440]   So they are targeted.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.680]   I have a whole chapter on the book there.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.160]   But one of the things that I did personally
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.560]   in creating my estate documents, my wife
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.280]   has a right, which I have a reciprocal right.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.560]   If she believes I'm in cognitive decline
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.080]   and are unable to make sound financial decisions,
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.000]   she can request that I have or require
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.640]   that I have a cognitive test.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.520]   And if I can't pass it, then I am
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.720]   to be removed from power of attorney over bank accounts,
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.480]   financial matters, brokerage statements, everything
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.360]   to protect myself and the family.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.240]   And of course, I have the right to the same thing.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.920]   And that's right in my estate documents.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.120]   And obviously, if you're alone, you
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.560]   want to have that situation where
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:41.240]   some trusted family member or friend or whoever it might be.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.640]   And I would prefer it not be some corporation like a bank
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.200]   trust that creates all kinds of problems with family members
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.240]   having difficulty accessing funds at times.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.200]   But if you don't have that, then some trusted advisor
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.240]   could play that role.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.000]   We do that for a select few of our clients.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   But you need absolutely to have somebody
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.960]   who you trust, the most trusted person in your life.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.440]   I'll just add one other comment.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.760]   Sadly, the person most likely to rip off the elderly
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.200]   is some family member who might be in trouble,
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.360]   either drug abuse, their business went south,
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.800]   they got a divorce and got in trouble,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.160]   and often will, sadly, rip off the parents.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.560]   I've seen people who were financially in trouble
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:35.520]   just ruin their parents' fortune by taking over
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.540]   and by convincing the parents to give them
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.800]   control over the assets.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.520]   And very soon thereafter, there were no assets left.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.960]   I've seen that happen.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.280]   It's really unfortunate because these are unpleasant things
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.920]   to think about and contemplate.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.000]   And therefore, people delay and don't do it.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.160]   So I'm going to urge all the bogleheads who
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.840]   don't have a disability policy, don't have an umbrella policy,
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:08.200]   and don't have this request to have an exam where you could
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.440]   pass a cognitive test, if you don't
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:14.920]   have those in your documents, go out and get them tomorrow.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.560]   Here's a couple of questions about different asset classes.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.220]   You could just answer these very quickly
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.760]   because I have here, there, and everywhere.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.880]   So one of them is, what role does cash
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.400]   play in an investor portfolio?
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:32.320]   Almost none because today, you can stick with short-term bonds
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.800]   just as highly liquid.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.480]   So other than money in a checking account,
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.960]   you typically don't need much cash.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.400]   As long as it's in a short-term bond fund,
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.120]   your volatility is going to be 1% or 2%,
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.320]   depending upon how short it is.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.240]   So you want to keep maybe a couple of months'
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.520]   expenses in cash.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.320]   And beyond that, there's no need to have a lot of cash around.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.600]   That's one of the most common mistakes I see,
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.440]   is people sit with lots of cash.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.760]   And what about peer-to-peer lending?
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.280]   Something new that I haven't heard you talk a lot about,
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.080]   but I know it's in your portfolios.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:12.600]   Right.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.200]   So this is a natural.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.480]   The banks have been disintermediated
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.840]   by fintech providers.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.360]   Partly, Dodd-Frank opened the doors for them.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.960]   The banks were short of capital.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.320]   And today, you can get a replacement for a 22% credit
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:34.440]   card if you're a good credit in the 13% to 14% kind of range.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.920]   And if your credit isn't quite as good,
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.040]   the rates go up from there.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.920]   After expenses, we think a well-run fund
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:50.240]   should be able to generate 4% to 5%, again, above T-bills.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.040]   And you're getting compensated for credit risk.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.600]   So last question, Larry.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   What is the most recent version, or the most up-to-date version,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.120]   of the Larry Portfolio?
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:06.480]   So the Larry Portfolio phrase was coined by The New York
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.040]   Times.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.680]   And it only referred to basically the equity
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.680]   portion of the portfolio.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:17.240]   So it was US small value, international small value,
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.240]   emerging market value.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.080]   So it's all in the highest expected return assets.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.960]   Now, you could use that Larry Portfolio in one of two ways.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:32.120]   I have investors who are young, willing to live
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.840]   with the tracking variance.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:39.400]   And they're 100% equities and 100% the Larry Portfolio,
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.200]   trying to earn that extra premium.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.000]   On the other hand, you have people like me
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   who have won the game already.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.320]   And I'm trying to protect my wealth.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.680]   I'm trying to create more of that risk parity portfolio.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.680]   I don't want a lot of market beta exposure.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.960]   But I'm trying to keep my expected returns up.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:03.000]   The equities I'm holding have higher expected returns.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.080]   That allows me to own less market beta and then
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.120]   more safe bonds.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:12.160]   So my portfolio was roughly, at the time,
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.480]   was 30% public equities, 70% safe bonds.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.920]   It's a little more diversified today,
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.760]   adding things like reinsurance and alternative lending.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.200]   I also happen to own something called the Variance Risk
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.680]   Premium Fund, or All Asset Variance Risk Premium.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.640]   It's also one of the most studied research,
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   well-documented premiums in all of finance,
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.400]   which is the Variance Risk Premium.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.280]   So you're selling volatility insurance.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.880]   We think that, again, has a 4% to 5%
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.680]   above T-bill expected return.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:52.600]   And I also own AQR's Alternative Style Premium Fund,
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:57.520]   which is a long-short portfolio of four different factors
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.240]   across four different asset classes.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.440]   So moving more towards risk parity.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.600]   But each one of them is a few percent of my portfolio,
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.480]   because I want most of my portfolio in that safer bonds.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.800]   Well, Larry, it's been very great having you on here.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:19.600]   And as always, every time we talk, we are 99% correlated
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   and only 1% uncorrelated.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.000]   Yeah, and people love to focus on the 1%
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.200]   because that creates the tension, right?
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.440]   Well, thank you so much for being a guest on the Bogle
