[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Take this. That's yours now. That's an Omega. And that has a moon phase.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.120]   See that moon in the bottom of it? That's yours. That's yours. You see the moon on the bottom of
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.360]   it? You see that? This is a happy man right now. That's my watch. That's my favorite watch,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.120]   by the way. Do you see the moon in the bottom of it? Yep. That is the actual moon phase. It's a real
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.920]   high resolution photograph of the moon. And as the moon rises, it will rise. It's set in the
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.160]   position where the moon is currently. Oh, that's awesome. Fuck yeah, it's awesome. Take that piece
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   of shit, stupid fucking Frisbee you got on your wrist. You can't get this back because you just
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.600]   did it on record. No, it's yours. It's yours, man. Joe, thank you so much. This is a steampunk watch.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.520]   That fucking stupid thing. The robot writes it and erases it every minute. That's so dumb. But
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.200]   that watch, that watch is my favorite watch and I want you to have it. Joe, thank you. My pleasure.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.080]   See that? You got a big ass wrist. Yeah, I do. Well, we can get it sized for you. No,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.800]   no, this is perfect. Fuck, man. But you see the little moon? Thank you so much. You see it at
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.600]   the bottom? Wait till it comes full moon, you get a real sense of what it looks like. It's beautiful.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.480]   It's a beautiful high resolution image. And one of the reasons why I like Omegas,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   first of all, the astronauts that went to the moon, allegedly, they wore Omegas.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.200]   But also, it doesn't have the same sort of cache value as Rolexes or a lot of like the people that
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.160]   have a peripheral understanding of watches. But they're fucking phenomenal watches. They make
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.880]   amazing watches. I have a bunch of Omegas. I love them. But that is my favorite watch. And you have
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.440]   my favorite watch now. Joe, thank you. Actually, this is the one thing I think a watch could add,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.320]   is perspective on the cosmic scale. That's why I like that watch. And that's why I think you
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920]   should have it. Because I would look at that watch and I would say, this is where we are right now
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.480]   with the moon cycle. And when it comes full moon, like right now, it's just kind of like a little,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.080]   it's probably a quarter moon or something like that. Yeah. Well, when it comes full noon,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.440]   you'll get a real sense of what it actually looks like because it's beautiful. It's a beautiful,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   high resolution image of the moon with like little stars behind it.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   See how much shit Connor got for his watch this week?
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yeah, but that's a ridiculous watch.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.520]   That's a ridiculous watch.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.720]   I don't like those watches. I mean, look, you could like whatever you like.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.360]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.040]   Yeah, that's a million dollars, his watch. That's preposterous. It's all filled with
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.640]   diamonds and shit. I don't own a single diamond. I've never had a diamond in my life and I want
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.240]   a fucking diamond. I like engineering. That's what I like. I'm a fan of engineering. And what
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.400]   I like about that watch is the engineering behind it. It's a mechanical watch, meaning the time is
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   kept within like a second or two, I don't know what it is, like a day or I forget what it is,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   but also with a complication. There's this crazy complication that shows the moon rising across.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.680]   And when it goes dark in the sky, I know when I can go outside and see the stars because I
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.160]   look at my watch. And when my watch shows me no moon, that's when I go outside on my deck.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.800]   Because when I go outside on my deck, I know I'm just going to see nothing but stars and no
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.480]   moon at all. No light pollution, just beautiful stars in the sky.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.200]   I'm going to take care of this one.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.880]   Take care of it, my brother. Take care of it.
