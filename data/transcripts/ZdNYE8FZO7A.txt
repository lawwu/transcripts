[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Today's question is from a listener named Emma, who is in love.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.820]   "Hello Tony and Pastor John.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.180]   Thank you so much for your ministry.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.780]   It is truly a blessing to me and so many others.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.380]   I am currently in a serious relationship with a man who loves Christ and encourages me as
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.560]   I follow Christ.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.660]   But as our affection for one another continues to grow, how can I make sure that I am loving
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.940]   God more than I love him?
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.500]   What exactly would it look like to be putting my boyfriend above God?
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.140]   And is there something like this I can expect to face in marriage too?"
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.760]   Pastor John, what would you say to Emma?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.780]   You know what I really want to do is to read to Emma a poem that I wrote for one of my
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.900]   sons when he was getting married, a poem about this very question called "Love Her More and
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.660]   Love Her Less."
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.020]   So let me give a brief answer and then I am going to close with just a part of that poem,
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:11.060]   because sometimes I think poetry can unfold a mystery of emotion that a straightforward
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.220]   APJ answer might not.
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.500]   With regard to that last question, "Is there something like this in marriage too?"
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.100]   The answer is yes, and not only in marriage, but it's possible to love children more than
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.420]   God, health more than God, reputation more than God, friendship more than God, comfort
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.420]   more than God, security more than God.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.160]   In other words, the question you're asking about the boyfriend is a question all of us
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.660]   must pose about everything.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.620]   Now that's why the 10th commandment is there, right?
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.620]   "You shall not covet," and covetousness means simply loving something too much, loving
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.380]   it the way you shouldn't love it, like loving a boyfriend or your husband or your health
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.260]   or your life in such a way that it starts to undermine your love for God.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:18.700]   How can you make sure you love God more than your most cherished earthly love?
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.060]   And one answer to that question is surprising, maybe the most important answer of all, namely
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.220]   that God himself will use whatever means he must to keep that from happening, to keep
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.460]   us from loving him less than something else.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.140]   1 Peter 1:6 shows that God regards faith in his children as so precious that he will use
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.940]   fire to refine it so that dross is burned out of it, and it comes through like refined
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.260]   gold to the praise of glory at the end of our lives.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.420]   The same principle applies to love.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.620]   So the issue does not lie finally in our own hands.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.140]   God will keep his children absolutely secure.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:25.020]   He will use whatever means he must to prevent us from idolatry, from loving anything more
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.660]   than we love him and thus making shipwreck of our faith if we are indeed his children.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.220]   The next thing to say is Hebrews 4.12.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.260]   How can I be sure?
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.820]   What means might I use to keep from loving my boyfriend more, or at least how can I find
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.940]   out if I do love him more?
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.180]   And the answer is the Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword,
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.580]   piercing to the division of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.220]   and intentions of the heart.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.620]   In other words, stay close in the Word of God.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.180]   Saturate your mind and heart with the Word of God, and he will cause you by the Word
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.580]   to know your own heart and what you love most.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.300]   That's what the Word of God reveals.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.500]   And when you read the Word, it gives you some specific criteria to test your heart.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:40.140]   For example, does your allegiance to your boyfriend or your husband lead you into sin?
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:48.760]   Does the pleasure that you have in being with your boyfriend diminish or does it increase
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.020]   the pleasure that you have in being with Jesus?
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.660]   Does the enjoyment of being with your boyfriend increase or diminish the enjoyment you have
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.080]   in being with Bible-saturated godly people?
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.100]   Does getting to know your boyfriend lead you to know Christ better?
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.100]   Does the thought of losing your boyfriend cause you to think of getting angry with God
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.380]   or throwing yourself more fully on God's mercy?
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:30.820]   Sometimes a poem can capture a mystery and stir us up to love God even better than a
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.980]   theological argument or an APJ answer.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.220]   So let me venture on that possibility for the rest of this APJ.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.700]   Emma will need to make an adjustment.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.100]   Since I wrote this for my son, and she's a woman, not a son, I didn't write it for
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.860]   my daughter, though I could have.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.540]   So all Emma needs to do is just do a little switch and think of me speaking to my daughter
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.180]   toward the one she's about to marry rather than my son towards the one he's about to
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180]   marry.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.940]   The poem is called "Love Her More and Love Her Less," or Emma would need to say, "Love
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.020]   him more and love him less."
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.220]   So here's the excerpt from the poem.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:28.620]   If you now aim your wife to bless, then love her more and love her less.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.540]   If in the coming years by some strange providence of God you come to have the riches of this
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:43.980]   age and painless stride across the stage beside your wife, be sure in health to love her,
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.460]   love her more than wealth.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.380]   And if your life is woven in a hundred friendships and you spin a festal fabric out of all your
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:07:00.660]   sweet affections, great and small, be sure, no matter how it rings, to love her, love
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.820]   her more than friends.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:11.260]   And if there comes a point when you are tired and pity whispers, "Do yourself a favor.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.260]   Come.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.260]   Be free.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.940]   Embrace the comforts here with me."
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:22.460]   Know this, your wife surpasses these, so love her, love her more than ease.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.860]   And when your marriage bed is pure and there is not the slightest lure of lust for any
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:39.140]   but your wife and all is ecstasy in life, a secret all of this protects, go love her,
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.560]   love her more than sex.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:47.420]   And if, to your surprise, not mine, God calls you by some strange design to risk your life
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:54.620]   for some great cause, let neither fear nor love give pause, and when you face the gate
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:01.220]   of death, then love her, love her more than breath.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.820]   Yes, love her, love her more than life.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.700]   Oh, love the woman called your wife.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.300]   So love her as your earthly best.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.660]   Beyond this, venture not.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:24.780]   But lest your love become a fool's facade, be sure to love her less than God.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:33.580]   It is not wise or kind to call an idol by sweet names and fall as in humility before
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.980]   a likeness of your God.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:43.540]   Or above your best beloved on earth, the God alone who gives her worth, and she will know
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:51.620]   in second place that your great love is also grace and that your high affections now are
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:58.060]   flowing freely from a vow beneath these promises first made to you by God.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:03.660]   Nor will they fade for being rooted by the stream of heaven's joy, which you esteem
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:10.100]   and cherish more than breath and life that you may give it to your wife.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:18.180]   The greatest gift you give your wife is loving God above her life.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.000]   And thus I bid you now to bless.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.420]   Go love her more by loving less.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:36.380]   And for Emma, the poem would have to close, and thus I bid you, Emma, bless.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.180]   Go love him more by loving less.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.140]   Thank you, Pastor John, for sharing that poem.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.260]   And Emma, thanks for the great and important question, one that I'm sure many other listeners
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.420]   are wrestling with right now as well.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.700]   Thank you for articulating it and putting it on the table for us to address.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.180]   Well, we publish this podcast three times per week with over 1,500 episodes now in the
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.180]   archive.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.380]   You can find them, subscribe to the podcast, or send us your own question.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.980]   Do that online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:12.420]   So how do we respond when life seems meaningless, especially when suffering hits and that suffering
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.220]   itself seems utterly pointless?
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.540]   How do we respond?
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.180]   It's a great question, and it's up next time when we return on Wednesday.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.740]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.240]   Bye.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   [music]
