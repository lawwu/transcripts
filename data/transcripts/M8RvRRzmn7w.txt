[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I should like to call your attention this evening to two verses in the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The first is in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew and in verse 23.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And the second is in the twenty-fourth chapter in verse 14.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The fourth chapter of Matthew, verse 23.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   "And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and healing all menner of sicknesses and all menner of disease among the people."
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And again in the twenty-fourth chapter, verse 14.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Now I take those two verses together because, as you notice, one of them was at the beginning of our Lord's ministry
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and one towards the end of his ministry.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But they all make mention of the same thing, and that is the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And it is to that that I want to call your attention this evening.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We are engaged on a number of Sunday evenings like this
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   in considering some of these things that we are told about the gospel in the New Testament itself.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And we are doing that, as I am reminding you, Sunday by Sunday, in order that we may really know what it is.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   The world is in terrible straits, and what it needs above everything is the gospel.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   But what is the gospel?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Is there clarity of understanding?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   What is it really? What does it teach? What does it offer? What does it give?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And this is the great tragedy of the hour, this confusion, in the church as well as outside,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   as to what the gospel of Jesus Christ really is.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Now, my position as I am expounding it is this, that I know nothing about the gospel apart from what I have in this book.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   To me, the fact that I happen to be alive in the twentieth century doesn't make the slightest difference.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I have referred to two men in my announcement, one of them who lived four hundred years ago.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He preached the same gospel as I am trying to preach.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I referred to the second man, George Whitefield.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He preached exactly the same gospel, because the two men expounded the scriptures.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And we know nothing about these things apart from the scriptures.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   There is nothing that is quite so fatuous as to feel that because we happen to live in 1964 that we need something new.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   That is, of all the fallacies about the gospel, the most fatuous and the most ridiculous.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Time has got nothing to do with this.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   The very essence of the gospel is that it is something that comes out of eternity into time.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Now, we have been seeing that at great length.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We have been seeing it, as we considered especially this great term about the gospel, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And now, as we approach this season of Christmas and think again about the coming of the Son of God into this world,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   this whole element of mystery comes to us anew and afresh and with a new urgency.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So, we are going to look at this particular statement concerning the gospel, which is contained in this phrase.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It is one of many, as those who attend here regularly will realize.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   But it is a very important term, and I say that for this good reason.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It is the term that our Lord himself used most frequently.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   When he began to preach, this is what he preached about.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He preached to this effect, that the time is fulfilled.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   The kingdom of God is at hand, he said. Repent and believe the gospel.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So, because he himself referred to the gospel in these terms so frequently,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   it obviously is of the greatest possible importance.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He starts with it, and as I have shown you from the twenty-fourth chapter of this same gospel,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   it is the thing that he emphasized at the end.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Nobody can read the pages of the four gospels without noticing that our Lord was constantly preaching about this kingdom,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It was the very center of the whole of his message.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He said he had come into the world in order to found and to establish the kingdom of God.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   That is his whole purpose. He says the time has come, it is fulfilled, it has arrived.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The kingdom of God is at hand, here it is.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Now then, he said, this is what I want to tell you about.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And he goes on, as I say, referring to this constantly, everywhere, in all his preaching and teaching.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You remember the occasion when, addressing the Pharisees and scribes and others,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   as it is recorded in the sixteenth chapter of the gospel according to St. Luke,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   he puts it like this, in verse sixteen,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   "The law and the prophets were until John, since then, since this time,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   He said that is the thing now, this is the big thing.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Before, under John the Baptist even, it was a question of law.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   But now, the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Or, as it is reported in this eleventh chapter of this gospel according to St. Matthew,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   he says that, preaching this kingdom, "The violent take it by force."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Now the question therefore that arises for us tonight is this, what does all this mean?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The Son of God came into this world in connection with the kingdom of God.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   He came to introduce it, to usher it in.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   He has been sent, he says, to do that.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So at once in his preaching, he begins to talk about this,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and he keeps on doing so, emphasizes it at the end.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Now then, what is it all about?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   What does it mean?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Let me try to answer this question.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Let me answer it first of all by just giving you a plain and a simple definition.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   The kingdom of God means the rule of God, the reign of God.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   That's true of an earthly kingdom, isn't it?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   A kingdom suggests at once a king,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   the place in which the king has rule and authority and power.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That is the definition of a kingdom.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's exactly the same here.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It means that realm in which God rules and God reigns,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   God governs, God is over all.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   That is the basic definition of what is meant by this term, the kingdom,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   the gospel concerning the kingdom.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's good news, remember.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   We must go on emphasizing that gospel means good news.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And our Lord says that he sent into the world
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   in order to bring this good news concerning the kingdom,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   the kingdom of God, the reign and the rule of God.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Now then, why is it important that we should look at the gospel
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   from this particular aspect and standpoint?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And it seems to me there are three main answers to that question.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The first is this.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   This particular designation or term reminds us of the greatness of the gospel.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You know, one of the most tragic things about mankind
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   is that it tends to reduce everything, makes everything small.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And that is what men are always in danger of doing
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   with this great and glorious gospel.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Now, let's be quite honest and frank and admit this,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   that there are many Christian people who have tended to do this.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   There are so many people who always talk about the gospel
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   in purely subjective terms.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   If you ask them what it means to be a Christian,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   if you ask them to do what is called giving their testimony,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   they will almost invariably do so in some purely personal manner.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   They will say that they are glad to testify that the gospel has made them happy.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   The gospel has given them peace.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The gospel has given them healing.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   The gospel has given them this, that, and the other.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Well, this is all right.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   The gospel, thank God, does that.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   But you know, my dear friends, that isn't the whole of the gospel.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And very often, in just putting it like that,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   we are guilty of reducing the gospel and its glory to the level of the cults.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   That's what the cults are always saying, isn't it?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   "Believe me," says the teaching of the cults,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   "and you'll get rest. You'll no longer worry.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You will lose your insomnia, and you'll feel that you're fit and strong,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and you'll have confidence in yourself."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   That's what the cults are always offering.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You see, they start with men, and they end with men,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   and they are agencies which are designed to give us something.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And so often, the gospel is represented just in that way,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   as if it were something just designed to give us this, that, or the other that we happen to need.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I say, thank God there are these personal and individual blessings in connection with the gospel.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   But this designation reminds us that that isn't the whole of the gospel by any means.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   In a sense, it's even the smallest part of it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Well, what is this gospel?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, the gospel reminds us in this very turn
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   that the whole world is involved in this matter,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   the whole cosmos, the whole universe.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The Son of God didn't only come into the world in order to give this, that, or the other to you and to me,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   who happen to be Christians, and to offer it to others.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   That's the smallest part of this salvation.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   The gospel itself is something big, something vast.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Let me put it in this form.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   The most important thing about every one of us tonight is not our needs,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   our individual personal needs, it's our whole position.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Our whole position in the universe, our whole position under God,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   face to face with God, that's the most important thing.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Now, that's the thing we all tend to forget, of course.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   We are so immersed in our own particular problems
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   that we tend to forget our whole position.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Now, the gospel described as the gospel of the kingdom
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   reminds us of this immediately,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   that the gospel is not something primarily concerned with our particular needs,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   but with the whole condition of the universe.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Now, let me put before you the great statement of this made by the apostle Paul
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   in the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Listen to this.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   He's talking about this gospel and he puts it like this,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   "Having made known," he's talking about God,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "having made known unto us the mystery of his will
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Now, here it is in the tenth verse of the first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   "That in the dispensation of the fullness of times
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   he might gather up together in one all things in Christ,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Now, that's the purpose of the gospel,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and that is what is meant, in a sense, by the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   The Son of God came into this world not only to deal with my particular needs,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   he has come to do something about the whole universe,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   things in heaven, things on earth,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   and as Paul adds elsewhere, things under the earth as well.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You see, this is a vast, it's a great gospel,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   the gospel of the kingdom of God, the reign and the rule of God.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Or let me put that in another form.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   There is, as we are reminded by this designation,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   a universal character to the gospel.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I mean this.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   You know one of the commonest attitudes towards the gospel today
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   is one which comes to us and says,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   "All right, you say you're a Christian and that it gives you great joy and happiness and so on.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Well, all right," says the man, "I'm glad to hear that.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   If it does help you, well, I'm glad to hear it.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   All's well and good."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But he says, "You know, I'm not interested."
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But he says, "You needn't take umbrage at that,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and you mustn't try to persuade me to believe what you've got."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   He says, "You don't understand.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   This whole question of religion is, in the last analysis,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   purely a question of psychology.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It's a question of temperament.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   There are certain people like you," he says, "who obviously have got a religious temperament,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   religious complex, if you like.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You are interested in this sort of thing.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   This kind of thing appeals to you, and you like it, and you're helped by it.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Well, all right," he says, "carry on with it.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm not. I don't happen to be that type.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   If I were that type, no doubt I'd be interested in religion as you are interested in religion.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But I'm not, you know.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I get much more out of nature.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I go for a walk on Sunday, and there I get what you get in your chapels listening to your gospel.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Or I get it in music," says another.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   "I get it in arts," says a third.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And on and on they go.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And they think that thus, you see, they've answered the whole question.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   They don't object to us, but they're just not like that.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Now, here's the answer to that.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   This is the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In other words, we mustn't start with the individual.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   We mustn't start looking at it in terms of the individual.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   We must start with the general.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And the moment you do that, you will find that it's something that speaks to everybody.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   It doesn't matter what his temperament is.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   It doesn't matter what his psychological makeup.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It doesn't matter what he is by nature, what his likes or dislikes are.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   What the gospel says is this, that every individual, whatever he is,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   is a creature under God and is responsible to God.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And the gospel is going to address him about that.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You may be a quiet kind of person, you may be excitable.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   You may be very clever, you may be very dull.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   You may be very knowledgeable, you may be very ignorant.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It doesn't matter at all.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The gospel says you're a man, and you're a responsible man under God.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And God is the ruler, and you are concerned with God.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Whatever you may think or feel, it applies to everybody.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   The gospel of the kingdom.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   This is so tremendously important.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   You see, many people have reacted like this to a wrong presentation of the gospel.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   They've been given the impression that the gospel is something that's needed for certain types of people.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   They say there are people in London, besotted drunkards.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   People have gone wrong morally and so on.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Well, they say they need this gospel of yours.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But they say we've never done those things.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   We've always lived a good and a decent and a respectable life.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And the gospel's got nothing to say about that.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Now, people who say this quite seriously, I've heard it said many, many times.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I think I've said from this pulpit before.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   One of the best things I've ever heard said about my own preaching was this.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   It was said by a lady who once used to worship here.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   She said, "You know, this man preaches to us as if we were sinners."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   She was amazed at that.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   That I should preach to her as if she was a sinner.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   The gospel was only for sinners.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   She wanted a certain intellectual entertainment and to be built up.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   But she was not a sinner.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And to suggest that she was, this is a terrible thing to do.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Now, there are many people like that.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Now, the answer to all that is this.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   That whether you were a sinner in the terms of the world or not doesn't matter.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   The thing that matters is what are you like in the presence of God.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And your temperament doesn't matter at all.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Whether you're musical or whether you're tone-deaf, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   You are a being, a human being, and you're before God.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And you've got to meet him and you've got to answer him.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   It's a gospel about a rule, a reign.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Or let me put it like this in the third form.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   The gospel of the kingdom, the term the gospel of the kingdom,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   reminds us of what is, after all, the ultimate purpose of the gospel.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And there's a great deal of confusion about this.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   What is the ultimate purpose of the gospel?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I wonder what your answer would be to that question.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Is the ultimate purpose of the gospel to make us happy?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Or to do this, that, or the other to us?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   No, it's not. That's not the ultimate purpose.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   The ultimate purpose of the gospel is to make us obedient to God.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   That's its ultimate purpose.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   The ultimate purpose of the gospel is to bring us to a condition
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   in which we shall glorify God and live to his praise and keep his commandments.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   That's the object of the gospel.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Oh, I know that incidentally in doing that it does many another thing.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And thank God for these other things.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   But Christ came into this world primarily to bring us to God.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   To establish the rule and the reign of God.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And that is why I say that people who think they're very respectable
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   and that there's nothing wrong with them
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   are possibly the greatest sinners in this world tonight.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Why? Because they see no need of God.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   The self-contained person is ultimately the most hopeless person of all.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   There is no greater insult to God than to ignore him altogether.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I'm not here to defend people who break the Ten Commandments
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and do so blatantly and fragmently.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   But there is more hope for a sinner who knows he's a sinner
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   than for a person who doesn't even recognize the being of God at all.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That's the ultimate sin.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And so, you see, we're reminded of that by this very term,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And this is the term that is most frequently to be found
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   on the lips of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Now I'm reminding you that he tells us that he came into this world
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   in order to establish this kingdom.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And that at once raises the fundamental question.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Why did he have to come into the world in order to do that?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   What's he mean by it?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   He's born a babe in Bethlehem to bring in the kingdom of God.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Why did the Son of God have to leave the courts of heaven?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Why do we consider this mystery of godliness?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Because it is the only way whereby he can bring in the kingdom of God.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   But why is this necessary, I ask?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And in asking that question,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I'm asking the question of questions for this hour.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Here's the question at the back of all your political questions.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Here's the ultimate cause of all your political problems
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and every other kind of problem.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Here's the ultimate explanation of all your sociological problems,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   every conceivable problem.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Why did the Son of God have to come into this world to bring in this kingdom?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Now, if you can't answer that question,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   it just means that you don't understand the message of the Bible.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The great message of the Bible is really to answer that question.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And I say again, you don't understand the problem of the world today
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   unless you can answer that question.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   What does it mean?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Well, it means this.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   This world has got into the wrong hands.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's as simple as that.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   God made it, he made it perfect.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   It's his world.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   He governed it and men rejoiced in obeying him.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Then came the fatal thing.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   You see, you don't begin to understand Christmas
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   unless you understand the book of Genesis.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   The Bible is a book of beginnings.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   The original beginning, the creation.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Then this new beginning.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   The whole of the Old Testament after the fall is waiting for a new beginning
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   and it comes.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Old Testament, New Testament, new beginning.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   It's a book of beginnings.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And this is why we are told everywhere in the Bible that the beginning is necessary.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Our Lord himself taught this very plainly and very clearly.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   He said, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   What's lost?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The world is lost.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Man's lost.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Man's lost his way.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   That's the whole trouble.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   The world, if you like, is a perpetual traffic jam.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Everybody knocking into everybody else and nobody getting anywhere.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   That's the world.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And it's the world that's lost.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   There's another way in which he puts it, still more strikingly.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Our Lord tells us that mankind is simply in the condition of a number of prisoners
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   which are held captive by a strong man armed, powerful, tyrannizing over others.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Listen, "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   But when a stronger than he shall come and overcome him,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   That's his way of describing himself.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   "And the strong man armed is the devil, and the goods are mankind."
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   "The strong man armed keepeth his goods in peace."
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Think of it like a great castle with great walls all round it.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And here is mankind, as we are in this chapel.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   We're allowed to walk back and forth along these aisles.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And we can go up into the gallery, in the top gallery,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and we say, "What wonderful freedom we've got!"
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   We can run along the aisles, we can run up the stairs.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "What wonderful freedom we've got!"
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   But the question is, can you get outside the building?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   "The strong man armed keepeth his goods in peace."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   There's a limit to it all. There's a wall.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And he's a great tyrant. He's very strong. He's very powerful.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Our Lord says that's the whole condition of the world.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   That's why he's come into the world.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Nobody could deal with him. The patriarchs, the prophets, all the great men,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   they all stood up to this strong man armed.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Not one of them could deal with him. He defeated them all.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Now, this is the whole of the biblical story, the biblical case.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   The apostle Paul, writing to the Galatians, says,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "Blessed be our God and Father."
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Why? Well, because he saved us from this present evil world.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   That's what he's done.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   This world is an evil world, this present evil world.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   The apostle says again that the whole of mankind by nature
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   is under what he calls the dominion of Satan.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   He tells the Colossians that they've been translated
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   You remember that on the road to Damascus, Saul of Tarsus met the risen Lord.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And he said, "I'm going to make you a witness and a minister.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And I'm going to send you to the people, the Jews and to the Gentiles."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   What for? "To turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan and to God."
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   You see, these are the universal terms that are used right through the whole of the Bible.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   The apostle Paul indeed goes so far as to say this,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   that the devil is the God of this world.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Why isn't this gospel preached? Why isn't it believed?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And the answer the apostle gives is this,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   "The God of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that believe,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   not lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ."
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   He tells the Ephesians,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   "Ye were thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   according to the prince of the power of the air,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Here's the state of the world and here's the only explanation of it.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And you see, they go on and say something like this.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   The apostle again says to the Romans that the natural mind,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that's to say men as he is by nature, is enmity against God,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   That's just another way of saying that people are outside the kingdom of God.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   They don't recognize him, they don't obey him,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   they don't submit to his rule and to his reign.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   They're enemies, they're rebels, they're antagonistic.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   They're all against God.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And lest you may think this is only the teaching of the apostle Paul,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   listen to John.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   John in his first epistle, he says,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   "The whole world lieth in the wicked one."
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And he uses a very strong term there.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   He says, "The whole world now is in the embrace of the wicked one."
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   He says, "You are of God, little children, and that evil one touches you not,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   but the whole world lieth in the evil one."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   This is profound biblical psychology.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   This is the sole adequate explanation of the state of the world tonight.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   It is in the embrace of the devil,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   the god of this world, the prince of this world.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And that's why it's living as it is.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   The devil instigates evil, he organizes it,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   he works in the minds of men, he works in their imaginations.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Don't we all know something about this?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   You may wake up in the morning and thoughts come to you.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You are not awake enough to think, but they came and they master you.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   They'll put you wrong for the whole day.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   They come to you at your most sacred moments.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Where do they come from?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   The answer is this prince of the power of the air,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Now, you see, this is the universal teaching of the Bible.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   The world is under the dominion of the devil.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   It's in the kingdom of darkness, in the kingdom of evil,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   the kingdom of Satan, the kingdom of hell.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   That's where the world is tonight, and it's behaving as such.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Our Lord turned to the Pharisees and he said,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   "You are of your father the devil, and the works of your father he will do."
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   And it's just as true of the world tonight as it was
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   when he uttered those words nearly 2,000 long years ago.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   The world is doing the works of its father,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   and the father is the devil, hatred of God,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   loving that which is evil and wrong and foul,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   everything that is twisted and perverted.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   You don't believe this?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Very well, I'll give you an explanation of it.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   You evolutionists explain the state of the world tonight
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   with all the teaching, the learning, the knowledge,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   the music, the good examples,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   and all we've had and boasted in all your civilization.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Here's the only answer.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   It's under the dominion of the devil, Satan, hell.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And you know it's not merely true of men.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Because of the fall of men, the whole universe has fallen.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   That's why I'm emphasizing at this moment
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   this cosmic aspect of this great gospel
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   which I'm privileged to preach to you.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it like this.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Looking out upon the troubled world of his first century,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   which is so like the world of tonight, he says,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   are not worthy to be compared with the glory
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   which shall be revealed in us."
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Then on he goes.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "The earnest expectation of the creature, the creation,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   For the creature, the creation, was made subject to vanity,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   not willingly, but by reason of him
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   who hath subjected the same in hope.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Because the creature itself also shall be delivered," listen,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "from the bondage of corruption."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   The creature, the creation, the animals,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   everything in creation is in the bonds,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   the bondage of corruption.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   "It shall be delivered," he says,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   "from the bondage of corruption
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Then he goes on, "For we know," do you know this?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   "That the whole creation is groaning
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and traveling in pain together until now."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   That's what he says about creation.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And isn't it true?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Nature read in tooth and claw.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   God didn't create a world like that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   This is the result of men's disobedience.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   This is the result of the men being under the dominion
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   of the devil and of Satan.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Man's wrong and his mind is warped and antagonistic,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   but the whole of creation has fallen with him.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Things in heaven, things on earth,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   things under the earth, angels have fallen.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   The whole cosmos has fallen.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Now, my dear friends, it's in the light of this, you see,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   that you begin to understand the meaning of this phrase,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   "The gospel of the kingdom of God."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   That's why the Son of God came into this world.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   We are all so ridden with pantomime ideas
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   that we lose the glory of Christmas.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   "Beautiful picture," we say.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   "Wonderful conception."
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   "Babe in a manger and in a cradle."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   "Let's have a crypt and let's play act about it all."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   What blindness, what ignorance, what childishness.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   The Son of God came into this world because of corruption,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   the bondage of corruption.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Man, by nature, is in the bondage of corruption.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   We all are born in the bondage of corruption.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   We are all moral lepers, we are all moral failures,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and we know it.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Can you give up a sin just by deciding to do so?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Don't you know something about the bondage of corruption
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   in your own personal life?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Where do these thoughts come from?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Where do the imaginations arise?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   What's the matter with me?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   It's my heart that's evil.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   I'm in the bonds of corruption.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And the whole universe, the whole cosmos,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   is in the bondage of corruption.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Now then, it is, I say, because of that
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   that the Son of God left the courts of heaven
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and was born as that little babe in the stable in Bethlehem.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   He's come because of that.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And why has he come?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Well, he's come to restore it, to head it up again
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   to the glory of God.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Now, his good news, you see, his preaching is
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   that he has come to do this very thing.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   So we are told that he began.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   From that time, Jesus began to preach.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   He's been baptized by John in the Jordan.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   The Holy Spirit has come upon him.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   He's then led of the Spirit into the wilderness
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   to be tempted of the devil.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Forty days and forty nights,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   back he comes and he begins to preach.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And this is what he began to preach.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Repent!
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   For the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Or as it's put here,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   he went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and preaching the kingdom of God.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   He says, "That's what I've come about."
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And he gives them proof that he knows what he's talking about
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   and that he's got authority to say this.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Is he able to restore the kingdom to God?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   He is.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   He's given proof of it.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   How has he given proof of it?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Well, he gave proof of it in the temptation in the wilderness.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   It's all in this chapter.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Here is the one who's defeated everybody.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Here is the God of this world.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Here's the prince of the power of the air.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Here's the master of the realm of darkness.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Here's the strong man armed.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   And he comes and in his fatal self-confidence,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   he pits himself against this mighty person
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   who's come in the form of a babe.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And he comes with his sarcasm and he says,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   "If thou be the son of God, very well, give proof of it."
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And he is repulsed by a word.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   He's answered by a scripture.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   He's completely routed.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Here is the first who is able
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   to defeat the devil in single combat
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and defeat him and rout him.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Here is one who can speak with authority.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   He conquers the master of evil,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   the controller of the bondage of corruption.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   The devil never found anything in him.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Our Lord was able to say that at the end.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Satan findeth nothing in me.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   He never wavered.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   He never fell.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   He never came nearer to it.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   He resisted him entirely without sin.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   He was, in every other respect, sin apart.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   But wait a minute.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   That isn't the only proof that he's given
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   that he is the one who can establish
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   this kingdom and reign of God.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   He not only can defeat the enemy in this single combat,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   he can master the hordes and the minions of the devil.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   There they are, these people,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   suffering from all manner of sickness and of disease.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Those who are taken with diverse diseases and torments
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   and those that were possessed with devils.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And there's devil possession in the world still.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Not merely men and women sinning,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   but the devils entering into them
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and controlling them and mastering them.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Devil possession.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   It's on the increase in this country.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Devil worship, devil possession.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   People selling themselves to the devil.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And he grips them and controls them.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And they're helpless in his hand.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   He is one who can cast them out with extreme ease.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And indeed, he even says that.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   There's a very interesting account of him
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   casting out a dumb devil,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   given in the eleventh chapter of the gospel
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   according to St. Luke,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   in the one that contains the verse about
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   the strong man armed.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And they saw him casting out this devil,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and some said he casteth out devils
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And their fathers, tempting him,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   sought of him a sign from heaven.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   He, knowing their thoughts, said unto them,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Every kingdom divided against itself
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   is brought to desolation,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and a house divided against a house falleth.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   If Satan also be divided against himself,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   how shall his kingdom stand?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Because you say that I cast out devils
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   through Beelzebub, the chief of devils.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   by whom do your sons cast them out?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Therefore shall they be your judges.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   But if I with the finger of God cast out devils,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And he did.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   He had authority over the devils.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   He has authority over diseases.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   He has authority over the wind and the sea
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and the storm and the rain.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   He is master.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   He has authority over men.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Here he is addressing these men,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   following their usual work and employment,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Simon, two brothers.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   and he saw them casting a net into the sea,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   for they were fishers.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And he saith unto them,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And they straightway left their nets
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and followed him.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The power, the authority, the command,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   and so with all others.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Here is one who is a master of men,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   master of nature,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   master of demons,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   master of the devil.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   He proved it in his life.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   He proved it still more
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   in his death upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Just before he died he said,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Now is the judgment of this world.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Now is the prince of this world cast out.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And he cast him out by dying.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   The devil thought he'd got him.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   It was there he defeated him.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   There is the masterpiece of it all.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   So the apostle Paul,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   in writing to the Colossians,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   is able to say
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   that it was in the cross above everywhere else
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   that he triumphed over all these powers,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   blotting out the handwriting of ordinances
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   that was against us,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   which was contrary to us,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   and took it out of the way,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   nailing it to his cross.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And having spoiled principalities and powers,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   he made a show of them openly,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   triumphing over them by it.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   The devil defeated and routed,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   ridiculed before the whole cosmos
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   by the death of the Son of God
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   and his subsequent resurrection.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Now then, my friends,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   that is his claim,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   and that is how he substantiates his claim.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   But let me close by putting it to you like this,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   so that you may see how practical this message is.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   How does Christ establish this kingdom?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   And it's here, of course,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   you've got the greatest misunderstanding,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   because here the mystery is the greatest.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   How does he bring in this kingdom?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   The first answer I've got to give is a negative one.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   He doesn't do it outwardly.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   That's the thing he said.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   You remember the Pontius Pilate?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   "Are you a king?" says Pontius Pilate.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   "Yes, I am," says Christ,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   "but you don't understand what I mean by that."
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   "My kingdom," he says, "is not of this world."
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "You only understand worldly, earthly kingdoms."
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   "I am a king, but my kingdom is not of this world."
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   "If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   then would my servants fight
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   that I should not be delivered to the Jews."
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "But now is my kingdom not from hence."
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And this needs to be emphasized today.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   He said again, you'll find it in Luke 17, verse 20,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation."
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "The kingdom of God," he means,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   "cometh not by some outward show."
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Now, that was the great mistake of the Jews.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   They looked for the kingdom of God
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   to come with an outward appearance,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   an outward show, by observation.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Everybody makes this mistake.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   The Jews did.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   They thought he'd come as a great king
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   and deliver them and set up his throne in Jerusalem,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   always materializing everything.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   He says, "It doesn't come like that."
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   You will read in the Gospel of John,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   in chapter 6 and verse 15,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   that after he'd worked the miracle of feeding the 5,000,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   they came by force and tried to make him a king.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   They came and they were going to capture him
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   and hustle him off to Jerusalem
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   that he might set himself up as a king.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   They tried by force to take him and to make him a king,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   but he wouldn't.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   He went up into a mountain himself alone.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Even poor John the Baptist
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   fell into this particular trap,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   sent his two messengers out,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   though he that should come,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   or do we look for another?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   If you're the king,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   what are you staying up there in Galilee for?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Why don't you go down to Jerusalem?
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   If you're the king,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   why do you spend your time
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   with a handful of poor, ignorant people?
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Why not come up and address the authorities?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   If you're a king,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   men, exert yourself.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Show your authority.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   You are thrown and rain.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Back goes the message.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   John, this is what I'm doing.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Have you forgotten the writing of the prophets?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Work it out for yourself.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   And you know,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   a most astonishing thing of all,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   even the very inner circle
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   of his own apostles and disciples,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   even they misunderstood the whole thing.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Being assembled together with them,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   he commended them
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   that they should not depart from Jerusalem
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   but wait for the promise of the Father.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   He appeared to them,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   among whom also he showed himself alive
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   after his passion
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   by many infallible proofs.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   And he began again speaking to them
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   This is even after the resurrection, remember.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   And then when they therefore were come together,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   they asked of him, saying,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   "Lord, wilt thou at this time
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Always materializing.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   "Is this the time
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   that you're going to restore the kingdom?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Are we all suddenly going to be
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   put into the chief positions?
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Ah," he says, "you don't understand.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   That's not the way it's coming now."
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   What does all this mean?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Well, I'm emphasizing that you must get rid,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   at the present time,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   of this outward show of the kingdom.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   The kingdom of God is not political.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Oh, this has been
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   the tragic blunder of the centuries.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   The kingdom of God
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   doesn't come by force of arms.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   That's Mohammedanism.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   It's not Christianity.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Christianity fell into the trap.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   The Crusades, in my opinion,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   fell into this very trap,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   the Crusaders.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   You can't make people Christian
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   by the power of the sword.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   You can't make people Christian
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   by acts of parliament, either.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   You can't Christianize a country.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   You can do what you like
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   in your parliaments.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   That doesn't promote Christianity.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   It doesn't come with outward show.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   It's not of this world.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   It doesn't come with observation.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   How does it come?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Oh, it comes secretly.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   This is the mystery of the kingdom.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   You go home and read tonight
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   the thirteenth chapter of the gospel
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   according to St. Matthew,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   and you'll find that it's full of parables
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   concerning the mystery of the kingdom.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   People didn't understand it.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   You see, they wanted that outward, external.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   They still do.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   But it isn't like that.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It's a mystery.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   And it's the mystery of this kingdom
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   working amongst individuals.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   He says, "Do you want to know
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   what the kingdom of God is like?"
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Well, it's not like a great king
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   setting up a great army
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   and attacking a foe
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   and conquering him
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and setting himself up over all.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   It isn't that.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   It isn't politicians
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   trying to legislate the Sermon on the Mount
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   and talking politics on it.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   It isn't that.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   What's it like?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Well, he said, you know,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   it's like a sower sowing seed into the ground.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   That's the kingdom of God.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   It's a word.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   It's a message.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's something that goes to the hearts of men.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Or it's like leaven,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   a bit of leaven that a woman takes
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and puts in a measure of flour.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Or it's like a man going out with a dragnet
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and drawing in fish some good, some bad.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Or it's like a man in a field
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   stumbles across a hidden treasure
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   when he wasn't looking for it.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Or it's like a merchantman
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   seeking goodly pearls
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and at last he finds a pearl
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   that so valuably sells everything
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   in order that he may get it.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   That's the kingdom of God, the mystery.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And it grows secretly.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   It grows quietly.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   There's no great outward show.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   There's no military victory.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   There's no political enactment.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   The world says nothing's happening.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   You people are preaching,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   but what's taking place?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Ah, the blindness of mankind.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   This is a mystery.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   It happens in the hearts of men.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   It happens in the individual conscience.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   It happens in a life changed,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and the great world knows nothing about it.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   It won't be in the headlines tomorrow,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   but it's registered in heaven.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   That's the mystery of the kingdom,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   the mystery of a kingdom
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   that cometh not with observation.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   When they say to you,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   "Lo, here," or "Lo, there,"
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   don't believe them, he says.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   The kingdom of God is amongst you.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   It's here now, but you don't see it.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   It's this influence.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It's this thing that takes hold of a man
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   and delivers him out of this present evil world.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   It's this thing that translates a man
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   out of the kingdom of darkness
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   It's this amazing change
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   that takes place in a man's heart
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   and in the depths and vitals of his personality
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   that we were talking about a fortnight ago,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   the rebirth.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   So our Lord says in His prayer
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   for His disciples at the end,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   "I ask not that thou shouldest
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   take them out of the world,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   but I ask that thou shouldest
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   keep them from the evil one."
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   They are not of the world,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   even as I am not of the world,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   but they're still in it, remember?
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   You're in the world.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   You're not of it.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   You've been taken out of its kingdom
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   into the kingdom of God.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   You live in this world,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   but you belong somewhere else.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   That's the glory of this kingdom.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   "Our citizens," says Paul, "is in heaven."
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   That's the kingdom we belong to.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   From whence also we expect the Savior.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   I'm a citizen of Great Britain
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   and I'm here to keep its laws,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   but I don't belong to it.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I belong to heaven.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   There's my citizenship.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   That's the place I belong to.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   That's the place I'm going to
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   and to spend my eternity in.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   My citizenship is in heaven.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   "This is the victory that overcometh the world,"
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   says John, "even our faith."
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   We are still in it,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   but we don't belong to it.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Without the world realizing what's happening,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   we've been moved.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   We've been changed.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Our whole allegiance is entirely different.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Even as when the Son of God came into the world,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   the world knew nothing.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Rich people, the big people, the great people
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   were packing the hotels,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   the inns of those days in Bethlehem.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   They may have heard a rumor
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   that a poor girl had come up pregnant
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   at the last moment,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   had given birth to a babe.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   What is that?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   They were discussing this new enactment
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   of Augustus Caesar,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   who'd sent out a new decree
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   and edict to tax the whole world.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   That's what they were talking about,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   and the world is still talking about it tonight.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Fifteen percent duty, increasing income tax.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   These are the things that matter,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   and they don't know
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   that the power of God unto salvation is here
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   and is changing men and women,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   delivering them from a life
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   that only lives in terms of ready reckoners,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   and how much I've got to pay,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and how much can I cheat,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   and how much can I have to spend on my flesh,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   eating and drinking and my sex.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Deliverance from that.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   The world knows nothing about it.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   But that's how the kingdom of God
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   is being established,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   and that's how it's been increasing.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   This has been going on, you know,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   for nearly 2,000 years,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   and it will go on until when?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Well, here it is, Matthew 24, 14,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   "And this gospel of the kingdom
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   shall be preached in all the world
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   for a witness to all nations,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   and then shall come the end."
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Here he is, nearly 2,000 long years ago,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   the carpenter of Nazareth,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   this fellow who's never had any training
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   and who has no learning.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   He says, "This gospel that I'm preaching to you
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   and have been preaching to you for three years,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   this is going to be preached as a witness
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   to all the nations of the world,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   every one of them."
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Why?
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Well, because that is the way
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   in which the kingdom of God is being built up.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Not by armies, not by acts of parliament,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   not by political reformations,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   the work of the Spirit of God changing men,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   translating them out of the kingdom of darkness
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   And it's going on in all nations,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   and it's going to gather men and women
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   out of all nations and tribes and languages,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   whether they're black or white or pink,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   it makes no difference.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Out of all nations, building up the kingdom,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   and it'll go on until it has been preached like this
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   unto all nations for a witness and a testimony.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Then cometh the end.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   And then when the end comes,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   the kingdom of God will come with observation.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Then he will come in a visible manner.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Even as he ascended upon Mount Olivet,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   he'll come again in bodily form,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   and every eye shall see him,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   and he will manifest himself to the universe.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   And he will come in judgment.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Oh, yes, he's coming again as he came the first time.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   The first advent reminds us of the second advent.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   He will come, he will so come in like manner,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   even as you have seen him going.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   King of kings, Lord of lords,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   riding the clouds of heaven,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   surrounded by all the holy angels,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   he will come and judge the world in righteousness.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   This is a part of his own message,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   a part of his own gospel.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   He's taught it, he's prophesied it,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   and all his prophecies hitherto have been verified,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   and this shall be.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   And you know, my friends,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   when he comes, he will judge in righteousness,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   and all that belongs to the devil and his followers
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   will be cast into a lake of perdition forever and ever.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   The kingdoms of this world
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   shall become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   as certainly as we are here.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   The elements will melt with a fervent heat.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   The whole universe will be purged
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   from this bondage of corruption.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   There's a day coming when even creation will be renovated.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   Nature will no longer be red in tooth and claw.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   The lion shall lie down with the lamb,
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   and the wolf shall feed with the ox,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   and even the serpents will become harmless.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   A little child will be able to handle them.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Even creation is going to be delivered
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   from the bondage of corruption
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Oh yes, the universe is going to be restored to God,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   to a belief in him, to a submission to him,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   to an obedience to him,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   a glad obedience, a joyful obedience.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Men redeemed will live to his glory and his praise
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   and will rejoice in it.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   There shall be a new heavens and a new earth
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   And those who believe the gospel of the kingdom
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   shall be in that kingdom of glory with him,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   reigning with him, rejoicing with him,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   spending their eternity in that glory
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   that baffles description.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   doth his successive journeys run.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   till moon shall wax and wane no more.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   He'll destroy all his enemies, how,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   with the breath of his nostrils.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   A word will be enough,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   and everything in heaven and on earth
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   and under the earth
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   shall be restored by him to its original glory
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   and even beyond that.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   And after that he will hand it all back
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   to his glorious fathers.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Let us leave it with these ringing, glorious words
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   of the apostle Paul.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Then cometh the end,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   even the Father,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   when he shall have put down all rule
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   and all authority and power,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   for he must reign
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   and he hath put all enemies under his feet.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   for he hath put all things under his feet.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   But when he saith all things are put under him,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   it is manifest that he is accepted,
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   which did put all things under him.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And when all things shall be subdued unto him,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   then shall the Son also himself
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   be subject unto him that put all things under him,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   that God may be all in all.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   He came to do that.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   He is doing it.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   He will finish and complete the work.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   And the kingdom of God shall cover the earth
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   as the waters cover the sea.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   My friend, the one question for you and for me is this.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Are you in this kingdom?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Who is governing your life?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   It is either the devil or else it is God.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   How do you react to the commandments of God?
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Do you hate them?
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Are they grievous?
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Do you dislike them?
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   If so, you belong to the devil
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   and you will receive the destruction
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   that is awaiting him and all who belong to him.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   All his kingdom is going to be destroyed.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Or can you say with the Apostle John
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   his commandments are not grievous?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   I delight to do thy will, O God.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   If you long to serve God and to obey him
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   and to keep his commandments,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   you are in his kingdom.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   For the kingdom of God is the place
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   in which men live for him and for his glory
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   and for his praise
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   and delight in keeping his commandments.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Are you in the kingdom of God?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   It is good news.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   This world is not going to go on like this forever.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   It is all going to be changed.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   It is all going to be made glorious.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Would you like to be in that glory and sharing it?
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   Very well.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Repent as he says.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Repent.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Acknowledge your sin.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Acknowledge your enmity to God.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Acknowledge your beastly self-righteousness.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Acknowledge your human trust in yourself
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   and in other men.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Get down.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Admit it.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Confess it.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   Gravel in the dust beneath him
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   and tell him that you deserve nothing but damnation.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Repent.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   But go on to believe the gospel,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   the good news of the kingdom of God
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   which is open to us by the very Son of God himself
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   who in order that we might enter it and enjoy it
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   for all eternity became a babe
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   and even died of the cross and was buried
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   but rose again and is preparing a place for us.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Repent and believe the gospel
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and you will become a citizen
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   of the kingdom which can never be shaken,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   the everlasting kingdom of God.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Blessed be God
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   for the good news of the kingdom of God
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   in Jesus Christ his Son.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Amen.
