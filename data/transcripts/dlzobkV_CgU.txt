[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   Oh my God, Saks looks like he got hit by a Mack truck.
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.520]   You okay, little fella?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.160]   How long were you out last night, Saks?
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.040]   Oh boy.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.360]   Did you see this message?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.480]   I got the text messages.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   I was like, what the fuck is going on over there?
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.240]   I got to get back to the United States.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.600]   Timestamp, 1.39 AM Pacific.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.320]   I'm still out drinking tonight.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.080]   There's no way I'm making 9 AM.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840]   I'll do 10 AM to noon.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.480]   This is Saks.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.640]   The negotiation has begun.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.520]   I'm waking up.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.960]   It's my last day on the boat.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.720]   I'm trying to get off the boat in a reasonable manner.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.320]   And that's the first text message I get.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.120]   That's the first text.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   Then six minutes later, Drake just came in.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.840]   Better make it 11.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:57.760]   Do you want to tell you the story?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.280]   So the thing I would compare it to is,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.600]   do you remember that episode of Seinfeld where
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160]   Costanza stumbles onto the model bar?
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.120]   You know, he finds the place that all the supermodels are hanging out.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.800]   And he calls it Shangri-La because it's like this mythical place.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.280]   And he spends the rest of his life trying to find Shangri-La again,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.560]   but he can never find it.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.060]   Yes.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.360]   That was you last night in LA.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   Well, so we were just out having a few drinks at this private club
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560]   that's new in town.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.480]   It's just me and, you know, my whack pack.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.080]   And the room is, it's just, you know, a few of us having drinks.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.680]   I'm sorry. Who is your whack pack?
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.640]   We can bleep out these names.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.520]   How many of the whack pack are on salary versus?
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.680]   He's like an NBA player.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920]   It's like he rolls in with six people.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.680]   What percentage do you pay?
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.840]   And what percentage are your friends?
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.340]   Yes.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.640]   He's doing the calculation.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360]   I guess about half receive some sort of monetary payment from me.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.960]   Not all of them are direct employees.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.840]   Some are vendors.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.280]   Some are vendors.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.920]   Okay, got it.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.140]   Lawyer.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.040]   Of course, real estate brokers.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.540]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.920]   You don't have to have them on payroll.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.800]   Oh my God.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.560]   So yeah, they're fee based.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.520]   They're fee based.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.640]   You could call it an entourage.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   Wait, how many, how many rolling your entourage?
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.680]   How many are there?
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.320]   Five, four?
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.120]   I'm going to say six.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.720]   I think we had about five people out.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.600]   Okay, great.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.320]   That's an entourage.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.880]   That's perfect.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.520]   Because that you can get into the club with that.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.640]   It's more like a private club.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.600]   It's not like a, like, you know, a different kind of club.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   Yeah. Now you're a member of this club.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   I take it.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.480]   Yeah, I'm a member.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.960]   Got it. Okay.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.800]   So we're just hanging out there having drinks and, you know, the room's empty.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.360]   It's just us.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   And all of a sudden there's like a subtle vibe change that happens.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680]   And we look around like five minutes later, the whole place is full.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.120]   And it's like Shangri-La basically.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   And we're like, what just happened?
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.600]   What happened?
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.640]   And then Drake walks in.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400]   And we're like, oh, okay.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.440]   Got it.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.920]   He performed at a concert in LA that night.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   So the after party was basically at this place.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.560]   So it's not like we were hanging out.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.280]   What were you drinking?
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.560]   Are you on the tequila still?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.760]   Or what are you on right now?
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.360]   You seem to love that tequila.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.560]   You on the ranch water still?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.920]   I used to like bourbon or scotch, but now these sort of highly refined tequilas are better.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   So the Clas Azul is probably my favorite.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.720]   Right now.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.760]   Clas Azul Reposado.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.440]   These Reposados or AÃ±ejos are really great.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.040]   And I've advocated to this group that we should actually have our own all in tequila label.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.600]   I'm in.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm in.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.400]   So we'll see.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.640]   That's great.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.760]   If the fans like that idea, let us know in the comments.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.120]   And we'll work on it.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.320]   Well, now, how do you drink it?
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.360]   Are you a neat guy?
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.120]   You put a couple of ice cubes in, or do you do like a Bill Gurley ranch water situation?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.720]   What's the ranch water?
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.360]   What do you mean by ranch water?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.680]   Ranch water is you take a Topa Chica, some tequila, and then what?
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.720]   You put a couple of limes in it for your bar, because you're on this ranch water kick too,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.280]   aren't you?
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.720]   I had a little ranch water the other night.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.000]   I had some ranch water last night.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.960]   You hear my voice?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.320]   I had a little too much ranch water.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.080]   But Topa Chica is just, that's just, it's a seltzer water, right?
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840]   In a glass bottle from Mexico.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.000]   But it's a fancy seltzer.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.240]   It's delicious.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.920]   And then you get lime juice in it.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.200]   And it's just, you know, it's a very, like, it's basically a double tequila and soda with
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.920]   some lime.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.840]   It's like a margarita minus the sugar.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.880]   No sugar, yeah.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.440]   No sugar.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.360]   It goes down very smooth, very refreshing.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.280]   You got to have a good tequila for it to work.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.440]   Yeah, I don't bother with the mixers or the fruit or any of that stuff.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.200]   It's just, I'll drink it on the rocks.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.400]   I can't be bothered with anything that is ranch and water.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.720]   Just seems so downmarked.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   It seems nasty.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.480]   Yeah, no, it's a Texas thing.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.120]   It's a Texas.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.840]   Downmarket.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   No, if you're drinking a high quality spirit, you don't need to mix it with anything.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.320]   You know, if it's a bad spirit, then you got to put all sorts of things in it.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.360]   But you don't add seltzer to white wine, to a good white wine.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.880]   When Bobby Baldwin was still running the Aria, and I was super gambling at the Aria,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.560]   my host invites me, and there was a huge Chinese junket at the same time.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.400]   And I'll never forget it.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.920]   These guys had ordered every bottle of Screaming Eagle.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.800]   Okay, so whatever, five, $6,000 a bottle.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.920]   And Welch's grape juice, and they were mixing up Screaming Eagle.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.080]   I'd never seen anything like this before or since.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.680]   It was unbelievable.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.800]   This was like a joke?
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.560]   No, that's how they drink it.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.280]   Come on.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.560]   No, they asked for the most expensive bottle that they had the most expensive California
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.200]   bottle that they had.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.880]   These guys pull out a case of Screaming Eagle, and they just start pouring.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.800]   We were playing together, pouring half Screaming Eagle, half Welch's grape juice,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.640]   like the grape soda.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.240]   I got to be honest, that does sound pretty good.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.000]   I don't think you need a Screaming Eagle.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.280]   Exactly.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.800]   Yeah, that's pretty nutty.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's like a sangria.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.760]   The big thing now that they do is they put the big ice cube in the drinks, the big cube.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.720]   But I think I'm old fashioned.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.320]   I prefer the multiple rocks, not the big cube.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.200]   Because I actually, I want the ice to melt a little bit.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.920]   I drink it up.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.960]   You want to open it up.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.320]   It's a relationship.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.760]   It's a relationship with the drink.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.400]   How does it start?
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.040]   How does it end?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.600]   Exactly.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.960]   David, I want an honest answer.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.560]   Do you have in the mausoleum an ice cube mold of your face?
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.080]   Not some super fan.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.200]   Just put that in the merch store.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.600]   Not on my face.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.960]   But we do have our own ice cubes.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.080]   We do have our own big cubes.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.720]   Actually, there's a room off of the kitchen, which is the ice room.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.760]   So they bring the ice down from Antarctica and they cut it.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   Most of it melts because he's not there.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.960]   It's the best.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.240]   Sax is the best.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.880]   He's the best.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.120]   But it opens up, right?
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.800]   So tell me more about the relationship with it.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   You start, you got a very powerful, strong relationship with it.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.320]   And then you what, ease into it?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.800]   It gets smooth?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.480]   Yeah, I mean, the reason why they do the big cube in theory, I mean, it looks cool.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.840]   But is because when the ice is kind of in one cube like that, it doesn't melt or it doesn't
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.560]   melt as fast.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.480]   And so it doesn't water down the drink.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.400]   But I want the ice to melt a little bit, you know, make it easier to drink.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.200]   When we drink scotch.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.840]   Sax, when you're drinking bourbon, is the whole shtick around Pappy Van Winkle,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.160]   is that real or is that just like marketing?
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   It's a little bit like Screaming Eagle, which is to say it's good.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.560]   But is it 10 times better than the, you know, $300 bourbon?
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.200]   No.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.720]   So there are other good bourbons, but Pappy is very good.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   It is undoubtedly very good.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.600]   And what, what makes a bourbon good versus moderate average versus shitty?
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.720]   It's, uh, I'd say.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.160]   Like, can you taste it like wine?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.480]   Like you can taste the difference in wine or not really?
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.160]   It's about how smooth it is.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.560]   Personally, I don't want bite in either my bourbon or my tequila.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.480]   So, you know, how smooth that is.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.720]   And then bourbon compared to scotch tends to be sweeter, but you don't want it to be
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.280]   too sweet.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.680]   So just getting that balance, right.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.320]   You know, the, these new tequilas are kind of like that as well.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.760]   You know, you choose how much bite you want, how sweet you want it.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.000]   Three things you don't want to bite in bourbon, scotch and.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.600]   Whoa.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:08:01.360]   Does anyone ever have a drink with a Collins ice?
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.040]   You ever have the Collins ice?
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.760]   Do you know what that is?
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   Check this out.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.680]   This is becoming a trend.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.760]   They cut a very long, uh, rectangular ice.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.400]   What do they call that?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:12.880]   Highball?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.000]   Is that a highball or is a highball the shorter glass?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.720]   I don't know.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.560]   No, I thought highball is the short glass.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.280]   No, that's the short glass, which makes no sense because they call it a highball.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.800]   But anyway, there's a funny meme where he take this drink and you, they show this and
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.880]   it's like, what happens when your venture capitalists after your venture capitalists
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.280]   get their preferred and their liquidation preference and they pull the ice cube out
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.560]   and there's one ounce of drink.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's great.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.360]   That's the prep stack right there.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.320]   It's the prep stack.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.840]   This explains the prep stack.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.440]   Your comments is the liquid around that ice cube.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.280]   That's really good.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.240]   That's really good.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.040]   That's really good.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.680]   Oh man.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.520]   Can I admit something which may be totally derided, but I have to say,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.920]   have you guys ever had a Cosmo in a short glass?
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.320]   So meaning not in a martini glass, but just a Cosmo in a short glass.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.520]   In a guy glass.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.800]   Guy glasses.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.160]   I think when a Cosmo is made well, it's an incredible drink.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.920]   Do you guys like?
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.880]   Too many ingredients.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.360]   Nobody here is going with you on this one, pal.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.800]   You're on your own.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:23.440]   I don't drink hard alcohol, but when I do, it's a Cosmo in a short glass.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.400]   There are so many better.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.480]   What about like a great Negroni?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.920]   It's not sweet enough for me.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.360]   I like a Cosmo.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.560]   And a margarita.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.000]   I like, well, I guess I like sweet drinks.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.800]   I like margaritas.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.160]   Oh God.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.640]   Here we go.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.560]   How long did it take you to do that?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.680]   I just did it.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.880]   It's a good background for today.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.040]   What is, oh, there's the entourage background.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.400]   I'm friends with a lot of the entourage guys now.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.880]   I know Adrian and I know Turtle, who is a big Knicks fan.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.840]   So I'm friends with two of the four, two of the four.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.720]   Really nice guys.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.240]   Like when you say, you know, you mean you've DM'd with them or you've done something in
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.880]   human life with them?
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.120]   I've hung out with Adrian Grenier many times.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.400]   He's a big in tech.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.760]   He's got a, he's a, he's a, uh, like a venture partner in a, in a fund.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.520]   And he lives in Texas.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.600]   Well-known public that he's in the Austin area.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.440]   Um, so I've seen him many times.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   I think Saks has too.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.680]   He rides in our circles.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.280]   And then, um, yeah, Turtle is a huge Knicks fan and I'm in a group chat with him where
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.160]   we talk about the Knicks.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.440]   So shout out.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.400]   And they're bringing it back, by the way.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.720]   There's a big fight between, I guess, Mark Wahlberg and, well, no, two of the creators,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.840]   but the whole cast wants to come back.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.400]   And then they want to do like, what would Ari Gold be like in this era of cancellations
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.600]   and political correctness?
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.480]   And I think that would be, cause it's having also, he's got to be a softer character too.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.760]   Now that he's grown up, he's matured.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.000]   He's passed the, the heyday of his career.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.680]   He's reflecting on life a bit.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.640]   It could be really good.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.840]   Well, that would be a plot line.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   You get, you put them in the middle of a cancellation crisis.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.880]   Jerry Farrar.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.960]   He probably has to issue an apology of some kind.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.920]   Something from the past, some texts he sent to some producer in the past.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.320]   I don't know what would be great is if I think the best entourage reboot would be making him
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.240]   the head of like Disney or something like he's in charge of my studio.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.120]   And then, are you seeing the snow white backlash?
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.680]   Oh, here we go.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.720]   Go, go, go ahead.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.600]   Here's your, here's your.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.520]   I don't care.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.560]   I'm not going to see the movie and I don't care much about it.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.840]   It's another Disney.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:34.880]   It's another Disney faux pas where conservatives are backlash against this revisionist take on
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.520]   snow white.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   The dwarves apparently are no longer dwarves.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.520]   They're just people with like funky hair.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.640]   No way.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.160]   Really?
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.720]   They made them non, they made the dwarves non dwarves.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.800]   I think they're still called dwarves, but they're, you know, normal height people.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.360]   So Lord, but they've got like blue hair, pink hair.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.160]   What's going on?
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.280]   Well, this is the thing.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.920]   The term dwarf, I think is not, I think there's some in the community, some debate if it's
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.640]   offensive or not.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.440]   So I don't know if it is, if it is apologies.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.200]   In the small person community, like what community?
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.640]   Person, there is a term person of short stature, little person and dwarf.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.840]   Those are the commonly used terms, according to the internet.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.640]   I don't think you get canceled for any of those, but I do think it's a sensitive subject.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.800]   And there are some differences of opinions.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.400]   Anyway, somebody who is a person of short stature complained about this.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.280]   And then a bunch of folks who are persons of short stature were
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:42.160]   very upset because how many iconic roles are there for people who are in this?
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.400]   Right.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   Well, this is kind of an ancillary issue, Jason.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.560]   The main thing that's raised hackles is that the actress who plays Snow White has been
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.840]   giving all these interviews and when she's trashing the original movie.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.760]   And basically saying that Prince Charming was a stalker in the original.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.520]   And so they had to change that.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.120]   And so you have to remember that Snow White was the original IP of Disney.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.960]   That was the first big movie they did that put them on the map.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.720]   I think before that, it was more like short animated films.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.600]   And I think Snow White was the one that Walt Disney figured out we could make a feature
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.200]   length animated movie.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.600]   And it made the Walt Disney Company.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.120]   So you have here, this actress is taking a lot of heat because she's saying a lot of
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.480]   things sort of trashing their original movie.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.720]   Now, I personally don't blame her because the thing she's saying, I think are the filmmakers
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.680]   intent.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.520]   And so really, you have to question the wisdom of the executives at Disney who could have
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.280]   left this material alone.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.240]   They didn't have to go here, but they did decide to go here.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.680]   They did decide to do a remake and they changed all these things.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.560]   Why even bother?
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   All you're going to do is ruin the public's perception of the original.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.280]   Yeah, that'd be like the new Star Wars people being like, "Oh my God, Han Solo was a misogynist."
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.800]   And it's like, "Oh yeah, he was a scoundrel."
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.240]   They literally call him a scoundrel.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.320]   Yeah, I mean, he's not the best guy, but he has an arc and he turns around.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.200]   I mean, it's a problem with trying to have to look at art in context, obviously.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   And speaking of which, I don't know if you guys saw this.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.440]   There wasn't a need for them to rehabilitate that movie by remaking it in a completely
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.160]   different way.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.280]   Yeah, here's what I say.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.840]   Standards have changed over 100 years.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.920]   So some of the things that you might see on film or in media or in books might be different
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.280]   over the last century and you might want to put them in context.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.840]   The end.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.480]   Let's move on.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.240]   But speaking of media, are you guys aware of this song that has rocketed to number one?
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.000]   Richman?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.880]   I haven't listened to it.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.520]   Richman?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:35.840]   All right.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.440]   So I just, I thought I'd bring this up.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.600]   I think it's, have you heard it, Freebird?
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.280]   Great song, great voice.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.240]   Incredible.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.800]   Can you play it?
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.920]   Because I haven't heard it.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.440]   Yeah, let me play you a little bit.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.680]   I want you to just listen to some of the lyrics here.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.960]   And then for context, nobody knew the song a week ago.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.640]   It got 25 million views on X in a week or three days.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.120]   And it's the number one song on iTunes right now.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.400]   Number one track in the country.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.880]   Here we go.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.520]   Coming at you.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.120]   Oliver Anthony, Richman, Richman coming at you on Thursday.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:09.840]   Time hours for bullshit pay so I can sit out here and waste my life away.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.000]   Drag back home and drown my troubles away.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.120]   It's a damn shame what the world's got to do for people like me.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.240]   People like me.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.960]   People like me.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.440]   People like me.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.200]   I wish I could just wake up and it not be true.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:33.280]   It is what it is, but it is in the new world.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.360]   With an old soul.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.520]   This rich man north of Richmond.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.240]   Lord knows they all just want to have total control.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.320]   Want to know what you think.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   Want to know what you do.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.240]   And they don't think you know.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.160]   But I know that you do.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.600]   Because your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.080]   Taxed to no end.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   North of Richmond.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.680]   North of Richmond.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.360]   Incredible.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.800]   When you hear the song, I saw that Sax was getting into it.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.840]   This is a popular song.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.600]   He's crooning the American voice.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.200]   Absolutely.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.080]   I'm into it.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.960]   It's the 80 million people who voted for Trump that, you know, if you read the top YouTube
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.360]   comment, it's the 80 million people that feel like they don't have a voice that, you know,
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.400]   Trump was speaking to.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.040]   He sounds like Wesley Schultz of the Lumineers.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.920]   It's a beautiful voice.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.640]   But obviously, Bill, the lyrics are what speak to people.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.120]   Yeah, let me--
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.920]   It delivers it so well.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.960]   Let's do a little all-in for the first time.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   A little cultural, you know, what would you call this?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   Appreciation of the lyrics here.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.760]   Or an analysis.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   I've been selling my soul, working all day, overtime hours for bullshit pay.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.440]   So I can sit out here and waste my life away, drag back home, and drown my troubles away.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.240]   It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to for people like me, people like you.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.080]   Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.880]   But it is.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.640]   Living in the new world with an old soul.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.680]   These rich men north of Richmond, huh?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.760]   Lord knows they just want to have total control.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.600]   This is a key line.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.280]   They just want to have total control.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   They want to know what you think, Sax.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.560]   They want to know what you do.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.960]   And they don't think you know, but I know you do.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   And so what's happening here is the author of the song, the lyricist, is saying,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.960]   "This is about big tech.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.480]   This is about the CIA.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.000]   This is about the FBI tracking us and then thinking that we're schlubs, that we don't
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.280]   know they're tracking us.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.640]   They don't know they're tracking the worker man."
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.680]   But the author speaks to the listener and says, "I know you do.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.480]   Just let it sink in, huh?"
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.080]   Do you have any lyrics here that spoke to you, Friedberg?
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.560]   I know that you're living this blue-collar life.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.200]   I just want to wax philosophical for a second.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.440]   I do think that, you know, for all humans to find happiness in life,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.960]   they have to feel like they're progressing.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.000]   And if folks are not progressing because of challenges they face in the world,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.920]   there's always an orientation that the system isn't delivering to me the things that it
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.440]   was supposed to deliver or the system is rigged and corrupt against me.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.680]   That's been the case for all of human history.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.880]   It's certainly the case today.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.040]   And with, you know, you read Thomas Piketty's book, Capital, he speaks so much about wealth
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:26.320]   disparity in an era of globalization, in an era of technification, in an era when the
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   world is seeing some people have extraordinary gains, but most people not on a relative basis.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.680]   And that voice speaks to a system that is preventing those folks from finding that path
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   in life that they believe they're due and that they think is obviously something that
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.400]   everyone should be born to be able to pursue.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.680]   I think it's beautifully said.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.640]   It's beautifully said.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.800]   It really speaks to the core and the heart of what people term this populism.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.760]   I hate that term, but it's a lack of progressivism.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.160]   It's the fact that folks don't feel like they can progress, not just in the US, around the
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.840]   world today, but really the US voice is so strong and so loud on this point.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:08.160]   It's why Trump was elected, that the system, whether it's the companies, the people, the
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:15.840]   institutions, the large, large, large federal government agencies are preventing folks clogging
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.160]   up, giving people, not delivering to the people the things that they said that they would,
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.040]   and not enabling them to progress on their own.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.960]   And I think that's really this, this, this song encapsulates the emotion of that feeling
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.440]   so well.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.520]   I think it also, I think that's what's going on.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.560]   Yeah, it's beautifully said.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.080]   And I think to build on that and then bring Sharmath in here, there's something unique
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.760]   about the American spirit that we're never happy, that we're always striving.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.640]   And I think this also encapsulate this, that, and if you look at the European spirit, specifically
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.520]   Italy, where you are right now, there are people who very much enjoy life and accept
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.840]   life and have maybe a little more peace and happiness and aren't trying to, you know,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.400]   upgrade, upgrade, upgrade to get the latest version of whatever it is, car, boat, house,
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.080]   you know, iPod, whatever.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:05.120]   And it's super interesting, this lyric, because it shows this frustration.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   And if you think about the frustration, Friedberg, to your point, we have the lowest unemployment
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.760]   in the history of this country, in our lifetime, I should say, and wars aside.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.440]   And when we have 10, 20% unemployment in certain groups, people complain about that.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.040]   People complain about their retirements.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.840]   We complain here about our portfolios and our equity positions and them being down.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.280]   Everybody in America complains.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.960]   It's why we are so successful is because we never accept it.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.360]   And we never actually take a moment to smell the roses.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.760]   Sharmath, any thoughts on that?
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.000]   And then I'll just read some more lyrics and then go to Sax.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.920]   - I don't know how to reconcile all of this with the other part of America, which is you
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.000]   pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and the system still roughly works.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.320]   How do you make those two things work together?
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:00.480]   It just seems like one cohort of people says the system is rigged.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.120]   Another cohort of people say, if you work really hard, America will give you a better
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.080]   chance than anybody else.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.800]   And it still does.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.640]   And it still does a better job than it ever did.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.600]   And there are umpteen examples that they'll point to.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.680]   So who's right?
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.800]   Is it that they're both right?
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.760]   - I think it is.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.000]   I was about to say, I think it's both right, Sax.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.320]   You could have a group of people who are unhappy with their current condition.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.000]   And there are people from around the world who look at America and say, I want to be
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   part of that system.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.280]   If only I could be in that country.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.080]   In fact, all three of your parents, Freebird, Sax, and Sharmath said that.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.520]   I need to get there.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.840]   I need to get to America, Sax, your thoughts on Sharmath's point about this disparity,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.400]   this paradox.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.040]   - So the way I interpret this word populism is failure of the elites.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.840]   When you hear people expressing populist thoughts, what they're really saying is that the people
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.640]   running this country, the ruling class, the elite has failed.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:00.400]   And we've just seen with two years of COVID that the ruling class got everything wrong,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.280]   pushed these insanely destructive lockdowns, lied about every aspect of the virus and pushed
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.320]   a vaccine that didn't work.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.600]   So I don't want to rehash COVID, but the point is just the elite, the ruling class completely
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.240]   failed, and yet their failure was covered up by the media.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.080]   - It's the best example.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.560]   Let's just say it.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.440]   Let's just call it what it is.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.240]   It is the best example.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.280]   - Right.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.760]   So I think people are justifiably angry about this failure of the elite combined with the
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.840]   lack of accountability because there's not honesty about what they're getting wrong.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.320]   And you see this pattern repeated over and over again.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.120]   So I think it's repeated in terms of how we got into this completely unnecessary Ukraine
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.600]   war.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.040]   It's repeated in terms of the crisis we've had at the border.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:47.600]   It's repeated in terms of the export of all of these industrial jobs to other countries.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.080]   And that has had all the-
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.960]   - Collapse of cities?
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.760]   Collapse of cities?
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.120]   - The collapse of cities with, you know, again, we have hundreds of thousands of people living
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.680]   on the streets.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.360]   I think all of these things have made a huge difference in the lives of many ordinary people
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.480]   in the country.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.880]   And so, yeah, this is a land of opportunity for people who have certain kinds of skills.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.360]   Listen, if you are technologically inclined, it's still a great country.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.640]   We're in this industry.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.240]   We know there's lots of opportunity.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.320]   It's always a great time to start a company.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.040]   But many people in the country have been adversely impacted by these policies.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.600]   And there appears to be no willingness of the ruling class to admit the problem and
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.640]   make changes.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.320]   The line, Jason, you quoted, where it was kind of like, "They know we know and they
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.600]   keep doing it anyway."
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.960]   It reminds me of a line from Solzhenitsyn who said that, "We know they are lying.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.360]   They know they are lying.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.520]   They know we know they are lying.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.800]   We know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying."
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.080]   That's the vibe I'm getting is this Solzhenitsyn line.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.880]   Nick, if you just pull up the link I just sent, this is a really important, I think,
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.920]   data set for us to all look at and for everyone to understand what's gone on in the United
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.400]   States.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:04.320]   This shows in 2020 dollars per capita income in the US by quintile.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:12.240]   So, the top 5% of earners in the US, you know, since, call it the mid-90s, have seen a near
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.600]   doubling of their earnings.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.760]   The top quintile, which is the top 20% of earners in the United States, have seen their
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.360]   earnings climb by 60% since that time period.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.280]   But the rest of America, the other 80%, have been flat.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.120]   >> And I think if you were born into the United States or told the story of the American Dream,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.160]   the story of the American Dream is you can come here, work hard, be smart, put in the
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.200]   effort, put in the time, and you'll be able to progress in your life in terms of comforts
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.560]   and assets and all these things.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.320]   And for most of Americans, that story has not played out.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.080]   They've worked hard, they've put in the effort, they've tried to be smart, they've
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.040]   followed the rules, they've done what the systems and the governments have said you
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.520]   should do in order to get the rewards, and they're left with flat earnings over several
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.000]   decades.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.480]   And that's the story of America right now.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.800]   And because of this, the top 20%, the top 5% have acquired an outsized amount of the
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.360]   assets, an outsized amount of the income, as we all know and have all benefited from.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.200]   And the vast majority of Americans that have been working--
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.760]   >> I have a question for Freeberg.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:26.240]   Freeberg, do you think that we should implement policies to change the lines on this graph?
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.560]   >> That's exactly what I was going to ask.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:28.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.920]   >> I want to reference you guys to the Tim Ferriss interview with Charles Koch from a
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.720]   couple years ago.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.600]   In that interview, he gives a really good example, and I'm going to mess this up a bit.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.080]   But he talks about how certain women that are hairdressers in the inner city, they want
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.560]   to go do this hair braiding thing.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.320]   But in order to do it, they have to pay thousands of dollars to school to get certified, and
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.000]   then they have to go to the city to get a license in order to be able to do that job.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.440]   So, the economic cost of getting there is insurmountable for them.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.240]   And there's countless examples like this, where in the U.S., we've created policies
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.640]   that have attempted to be forms of protection or perhaps be forms of income generation for
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.680]   cities and governments and so on, that in the process, unfortunately, have limited the
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   mobility of people that want to be individual earners and entrepreneurs in the U.S.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.360]   I think that is the first thing I would do to address this problem.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.400]   Give every American the opportunity to be an entrepreneur, to build their own path.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.640]   Do you think that hair braiding, licensing, fixing that problem will cause the dashed
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.440]   black line or the blue line to shrink?
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.520]   Or I guess what I'm trying to ask you is, should those lines shrink?
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.440]   I don't think it's the government's role, right?
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.080]   I mean, I'll tell you.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.580]   I'll tell you.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.720]   I want to hear Friedberg's answer, Jason.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   I'll answer the question.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.540]   Okay.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.960]   I've said this in the past.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.200]   If you shrink those lines, you will limit overall progress.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.480]   And what I mean by progress is improvements in productivity, improvements and advances
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:13.760]   in technology, in business, in economic growth, because we've seen this many times in the
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.160]   past.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.160]   There's a certain limit on taxation.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.600]   So one method is to tax, right?
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.280]   Pull more money out of the top earners and redistribute it.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.160]   The problem is when you do that, there's less capital in the hands of those who have
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.040]   proven themselves to be good at driving productivity and improving access for goods and commodities
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.320]   and things that are cheaper for everyone.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.720]   So there is a cost to doing that.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.960]   And that has been, this has played out.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.480]   I mean, this is the Roman empire.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.760]   This is the British empire.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.240]   This has played out countless times in history.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.360]   In recent years, it's played out probably half a dozen times.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.480]   You're evading the question.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.920]   I just want to know what you think.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.760]   What do you think?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.560]   I think that there's an important balance to strike.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.080]   So I don't think it's about taking away from the top as much as it's about enabling the
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.200]   bottom, if that makes sense.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.160]   It doesn't because that's what everybody says they want to do.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.200]   And this is, it's been 50 years of people saying that it doesn't work.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:03.700]   What?
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.680]   So he's not going to answer.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.960]   So you answer, Chamath, what do you think?
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.240]   I'm just telling you there's a consequence to doing, you know, whatever we want to do
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.400]   to try and make everyone equal and end up in a social state.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.840]   Here's my, here's my issue.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.880]   The way that you present it, like you tell it in a language.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.000]   And even I felt that where I was like, wow, this guy's really empathizing.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.240]   Wow.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.040]   My God, he's really.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.520]   But then the follow-up to like, well, what would you do is non-existent.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.120]   And I think that that's the real problem.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.840]   A lot of people want to pretend that this is an issue and they want to get the sympathy
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.520]   of the masses by giving the populist rhetoric of why this is an issue.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.480]   But when push comes to shove and the question is, do you believe that the dashed black line
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.280]   or the blue line should be legislatively brought down to meet the other lines?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.920]   People just evade the question.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.280]   In my perspective, the answer is no, you cannot do that.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.720]   And the reason why United States GDP is where it is, is because of that dashed line.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.320]   It's an existence proof of the fact that this is the largest economy in the world.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.400]   And so one has to make a really simplistic decision, which is, do you want economic supremacy
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   and then try to figure out ways of rebalancing things?
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.120]   Or do you not?
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.880]   I say you absolutely must start with that, which means that that dashed line and that
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.280]   blue line will always have a rate of acceleration that is greater than the other lines.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.720]   And that's just natural opex leverage that exists in any company.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.400]   If you look at a company with 50% EBITDA margins versus a company with 15% EBITDA margins,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.280]   because one uses technology and the other one doesn't.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.560]   Capitalism is right with these examples.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.080]   - Yeah.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.320]   Chamath, that is the smartest thing you've said in 142 episodes of the All-In Pod.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.880]   (laughing)
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.280]   But I agree 100% Chamath with your...
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.160]   - I think it's well said.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.360]   - But then you should just say it.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.520]   I think we do a huge disservice by pretending to care and then not seeing the ugly truth.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:04.880]   The ugly truth is none of us want the government to try to bring that dashed black line or that
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.320]   blue line down.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.880]   We want them to stay out of our way.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.840]   That is the truth.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.960]   - Yep.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.640]   - So if you talk to that guy that wrote that song and his 80 million followers,
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.560]   what do you say to them?
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.400]   - I don't think he...
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   - What do you say to them?
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.840]   - I don't know.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.040]   - Can I take a shot at this?
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.000]   - It's my honest answer.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.720]   - I want to get Saxon.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.120]   Sax, go.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.320]   - Okay, look, I think when you see a chart like that, the natural instinct is that you
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.400]   want to argue for redistribution.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.120]   You basically want to take from one of the top lines and just give it to one of the bottom
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.840]   lines.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.760]   And I think that only works to a degree.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.240]   I think it's important that we have a social safety net.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.320]   But what we've seen is that Marxist redistribution doesn't ultimately work.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.840]   It actually makes a society poor.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   I think this is where Chamath is right.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.880]   The simplistic solutions don't work.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.360]   We're not going to move from fundamentally a capitalist system to a sort of Marxist
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.120]   redistributive system.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:04.160]   But that doesn't mean that we can't do things to improve the situation for the average American.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.480]   And I think there the policies are more complicated.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:14.320]   But I think we could have much more prudent handling of our fiscal situation so that inflation,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.280]   for example, doesn't eat away the wages of American workers.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.680]   I think we could have a much more sensible immigration policy so that there's not, I
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.520]   think, a lot of competition for, let's call it low-end jobs.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.400]   I think we could have had a better trade policy with China over the last 20 years.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.200]   I think there are things that we could do that were more nuanced that would have improved
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.920]   the situation for working-class Americans.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.120]   And we didn't do it.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:45.440]   And you compound that with, again, all these elite failures around things like COVID, around
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.280]   things like foreign wars.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:53.360]   And let's add to this the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. critique of regulatory capture, that the
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.240]   military-industrial complex is bleeding this country dry.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.480]   And I think you add all those things together, and I can see why there are complaints.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.320]   - There have been three major responses over the past 50 years to this problem.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:14.720]   And all of them involve creating budget dollars to fund access to everyone of three major
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.360]   things, which is healthcare, education, and housing.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.560]   And it sounds good in principle.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.280]   It is a good thing to say everyone deserves to have access to buying a home, everyone
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.960]   deserves to have access to an education, everyone deserves to have access to healthcare.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:34.400]   The problem is when the federal government has stepped in to build the programs to provide
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.360]   these solutions, they've created extraordinary incentive problems that have caused asset
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.280]   bubbles and have ultimately caused failure in the underlying system that you're trying
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.800]   to give everyone access to.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.960]   We have told every American that they should put all of their net worth and more into their
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.520]   house.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   And as a result, we've had to continue to drive up the price of housing in the U.S.,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.560]   drive up, create a housing bubble by pouring a ton of capital in to keep that asset safe
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.320]   and protected because it is where most Americans have put their nest egg.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.800]   We've given everyone access to an education by giving free student loans out, and those
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.320]   student loans have caused an asset bubble in the price of education.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.840]   And we have tried to provide healthcare to everyone through the federal government that
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.440]   has no accountability, and as a result, the cost of healthcare has ballooned.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.240]   So I think the one question for you guys is, in the sense that most people are saying these
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.160]   are three critical things that I need access to, but when the federal government gets involved
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.080]   and provides them, the cost soars, and we have all of these bubble problems and disincentives
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.560]   that arise in the system and money gets stolen and yada yada, what's the right solution then?
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:34.800]   Right?
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:42.160]   How do you provide, Sax, that 80% of Americans access to these things that boost their condition
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.760]   in life without causing what is effectively inflation across all of them?
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.600]   I don't think those are the areas.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.760]   Yeah, I would like to start by just saying, when we look at this chart, I think it maybe
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.120]   looks worse than it actually is in reality.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.000]   I think when you look at the chart, you say, "Oh my God, this is terrible."
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.120]   But there are people around the world who are fighting to get in this country who want
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.320]   to be part of this chart.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.400]   Now, why do they want to be part of this chart?
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.840]   It's because they perceive that even the middle quartile, even the fourth quartile here, the
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.720]   bottom quartile, they feel like that's better than their lot in life in their country.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.040]   So this, if you were to expand it and put a couple of other countries on it, you would
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.280]   say, "Hey, even the people who are in the fourth quartile in America are doing better
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.760]   than people in the middle quartile in another country, and the opportunity is still here."
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:36.320]   And that's my second point, which is, how easy is it or how possible is it for the next
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:44.400]   generation, if you came here as immigrants, like many of you did, and obviously my grandparents
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   did, how easy is it to get from that green line to the orange, from the orange to the
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.240]   red, the red to the purple, et cetera?
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:50.880]   That's the generalization.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.480]   And that's what I think we need to focus on.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.080]   Forget about all the programs, forget about tax, moving up.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.720]   How do you move up?
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.240]   That's a wonderful point, because I think the generalization that this chart is like
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.480]   chart porn, because it's meant to be titillating, but it tells a very poor story of that exact
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:13.600]   dynamic, which is, if you started in the green line, which I did, my parents made $32,000.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.000]   That's the most they ever made in their best year.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   But most of the time with welfare, we were living on between $15,000 and $21,000 a year.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.080]   Yet somehow we went from the green line to the dashed black line.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:32.720]   So the thing that this chart isn't really representing is, is there enough people that
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.600]   go from green to orange, orange to red, red to purple, purple to blue, blue to dashed
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:37.920]   black?
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.840]   That's what really matters.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.720]   That's why I think this chart is mostly pointless.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:50.160]   Because if in fact what you saw was that in any given cohort of people, they were not
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.720]   the cohort before that was in the dashed black line, you would say, "Wow, we're actually
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.320]   creating wealth distribution in a very unique way, which is an entire new cohort of people
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.200]   are becoming wealthy in every generation."
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.320]   If however, it's the same 50 people that are in the dashed black line, obviously that's
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:08.800]   not good.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.920]   But our lived experience is not that.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:18.480]   So I think the real question is, can we find a different way of actually telling the truth
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:27.680]   using this information so that instead of bear hugging random populist sentiments and
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.640]   statements to try to win favor with people, we actually just acknowledge the problem where
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.200]   it lies.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.600]   That individual that wrote that song, which line is he on?
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.280]   Which line was his father on?
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.960]   And which line will his children be on?
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.240]   That's the critical question.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.720]   It's not that the line shouldn't exist.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.960]   And nowhere else on earth would the three of us, I mean, you know,
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.720]   Which line did you start on?
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.640]   I started on the green.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.560]   I know, I'm asking for a break.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.840]   We're just, I started between the fourth quartile and the middle quartile.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.360]   I mean, when we moved to the US, my parents always just looked for gigs that they could
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:03.920]   make money.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.280]   So you were fourth quartile, you think?
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.920]   40K?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.640]   Yeah, we had no money.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.440]   I don't know what to tell you.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.680]   I mean, we, you know, my parents, we moved to LA when I was six years old from South
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.080]   Africa and they worked gigs their entire lives.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   I think my family went from fourth to the middle and then my brothers and I all went
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.520]   up to at least one or two lines higher.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.200]   By the way, another thing, that's the, sorry, I think that's the important story.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.240]   If you guys read some of the comments on YouTube, which we always argue we should or
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.320]   shouldn't have, but, you know, but on, I just want to point this out.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.600]   There's, to Chamath's point, there's immediate approximation of people based on which
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.200]   quartile or quintile they're in, rather than an approximation on their transversal of the
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.120]   quartiles or quintiles or whatever.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.480]   Well, I think what's really true about all four of us is that we all transverse the
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.040]   quintiles.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.160]   We all moved from there to there and none of us were wealthy.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.720]   Just a few years ago, we all, you know, made our way in the world and in the United
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.240]   States in a way that we would not have been able to anywhere else on earth.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.320]   And I do think that that is the most powerful aspect of, you know, American liberalism
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.280]   and democracy still.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.560]   I think this characterization of people based on their wealth is what's so disturbing to
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.920]   me because you hear it from Elizabeth Warren, you hear it from AOC, but it discredits the
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.360]   fact that those people typically were not wealthy a few years ago.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   That the people that should be celebrated are the ones that went from not wealthy to
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   wealthy through the means of creating things that ended up being useful and productive
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.200]   or whatever the system asked for and they created value there.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.760]   And I think that the lack of recognition of entrepreneurship, the ability for immigrants
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.400]   to come to this country and transverse these quintiles is one of the challenges.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.800]   That would require them to be a little bit curious about the individual and to not use
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.480]   the individual as just an object to win their argument.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.120]   And, you know, I think that is the sin of politics is that they're just using just different
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.840]   objects out there.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.120]   Zach, let me ask you the question then.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.720]   What do you say to the blue collar worker in Richmond that this guy is speaking to in
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.360]   terms of their ability to transverse those quintiles, to go from low income earner?
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.880]   They're a blue collar worker.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.320]   They work a union job or they work as a plumber or they work in some manufacturing facility.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.920]   Teacher, this is the point.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.400]   You're not supposed to grin fuck him.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   So by pretending like all of this is what they hate, they hate all of you fucking people,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.440]   grin fucking them.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.720]   Stop grin fucking them.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.360]   Stop pretending that you care, that you really care and oh, woe is them.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:41.280]   But the reality is it is implicitly impossible for anybody on this fucking podcast to talk
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.520]   about how this system has not worked for them.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:48.320]   OK, and so what we need to do is actually take a step back and just acknowledge the
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.240]   fact that we were in the green line.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.640]   We somehow by a bunch of fate and luck and hard work and opportunity that this country
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.120]   provided.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.840]   And so the real question is, what did that guy can he do differently?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.200]   Has he done or shouldn't have done that has kept them in there?
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   And one of the things that I would like to bring up that are that is really worth exploring
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:12.640]   for multigenerational Americans, which is not talked about enough, is when we introduced
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.680]   or when we I'm talking.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:20.880]   Collectively, we Lyndon Johnson, really the war on poverty that had an inexorable change
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.000]   in the dynamics of America in black wealth, in white wealth, in the trapped amount of
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.800]   wealth, the destruction of nuclear families.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.200]   All of these trends started a few years post the introduction of the war on poverty, and
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.480]   nobody talks about that.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.120]   So I disagree with you, Friedberg, when you point to health care and those are secondary
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.720]   and tertiary derivatives of the actual war on poverty.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.200]   And that was Lyndon Johnson's signature legislation post the assassination of JFK.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.400]   And nobody really looks at what that actually did to change and potentially misalign incentives
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.680]   in the United States that have compounded to create this issue.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:01.040]   So I would say to the Richmond person, I have enough respect for you, sir, to not grin,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.280]   fuck you and tell you how well was this graph.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.320]   I don't know what the solution is.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.040]   And I think we just need to talk and figure out to see if there are some ideas that that
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.560]   can improve the situation.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:18.000]   But some of them, some of them do come to the fundamental incentives that the government
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.720]   has created that we need to either undo or change.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.000]   - Saxon.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.880]   - Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of good points in there.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   Just to echo some of the things you guys said, I think when my family came to America in
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.520]   1977, I think my dad was making $27,000 a year.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.680]   So it was green or orange or something like that.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.000]   One of the bottom one or two quintiles.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.840]   And then we moved up because he's a doctor and had that education.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.440]   So, you know, how you do in this country is gonna depend a lot on what kind of education
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.080]   you have, what kind of skills you have, like you guys are saying.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.760]   Now, that being said, I still think there is a policy role here.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   I do think that a lot of the policies we've had in this country over the last couple of
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.240]   decades have not been great for working class people.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.080]   And I think there are things we can adjust.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.640]   But to Tramas' point, declaring a simple war on poverty that's based around redistribution
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.480]   doesn't work because what we've seen is that it also creates a lot of dependency.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.880]   And so a lot of these policies backfire.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.000]   So simplistic redistribution is not gonna solve the problem.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.960]   However, I do think that having a policy response that does try to create more opportunity
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:29.680]   in these working class communities, again, we didn't need to hollow out our industrial
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   communities by exporting jobs to China.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.800]   We didn't need to create all this low-end wage pressure by basically having an open
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.840]   border for so many years.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.400]   So there were choices that we made that did make life rough for these people.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.520]   And then when they start to complain about it, we censor them or call them deplorables.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   And so I do think that the response that the elite has, and that really the mainstream
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.160]   media has towards these people, does fuel the alienation and polarization.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.240]   So we could be reacting a lot better to the complaint here.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.280]   - I'll tell you what's happened, I think, is America went from a country
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.120]   where people pulled themselves up by the bootstraps.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:18.160]   They believed in radical self-reliance and that they determined their fate.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.560]   And then over time, we've solely looked at the government as the determinant of our fate.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:28.800]   And what handout, what tax break for the rich, what can I get?
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.880]   What edge can I get on the system?
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.000]   What angle shot?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.520]   How can I look at the government as the solution to our problems?
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.640]   And what I think all sides of the political spectrum need to look at and celebrate,
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.960]   and this is why I think Chris Christie and Vivek are like really good candidates,
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.360]   is because they're not looking at handouts or blaming the government or looking to the
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.600]   government to solve problems, but looking at your community, looking inside yourself and saying,
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.800]   "Hey, what are the ways in which, if I want to, if I want to move up those strata?"
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.040]   And remember, some people work to live.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.000]   They don't live to work.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.440]   They just want to do their nine to five, put their time in and spend time with their families
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.960]   or do their art, whatever.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.320]   Their job does not define them.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.760]   And we are a biased group of entrepreneurs who are define ourselves in large part by
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.200]   what we do in our work.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.640]   It doesn't mean we don't care about our families, but we put that front and center.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.160]   Some people don't want to move up the line.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.440]   They're happy and content where they are.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:28.640]   But the entire dialogue in America is about how unfair, you know, we split that tax base,
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.000]   as you talk about, Freeberg, the spending and everybody wanting their piece and everybody
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.480]   wondering who got a bigger piece of the pie, as opposed to wondering, "Hey, how can I improve
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.200]   myself?
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   How can I provide more value to the world?
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.240]   How can I build a business?
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.840]   How can I build a skill set?"
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.520]   And that's where the dialogue needs to move.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.760]   And I just, when I hear Vivek speak, you know, I disagree with him about a lot of things.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.720]   I hear Chris Christie speak.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:53.440]   I obviously disagree with him about a couple of issues, but I'm liking those candidates
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.800]   and I'm liking the direction they're going.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.840]   Vivek has a great line, which is "victimization is a choice."
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.160]   And you see different versions of it on both the right and the left.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.640]   On the left, the victimization is based on identity politics, where if you're born into
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.120]   a certain group, then you're automatically a victim, regardless of really your circumstances.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:16.000]   On the right, it's more, again, it's more of this populist critique where if you're
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.360]   a working class person, then you've been victimized by those policies.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.400]   I think there's some degree of truth in both critiques.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.480]   I mean, I do think that policymakers have to meet people halfway.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.160]   We need to have policies that work better for working class.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.040]   We need to have policies that prevent discrimination.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.720]   At the same time, people can't just buy into this victimhood mentality where they're like,
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.080]   "Okay, I don't need to do anything on my own to improve my circumstances.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   The whole system is rigged against me.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.640]   I don't need to take any agency for my own actions."
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.200]   Alsoâ
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.320]   And I think it needs to be both.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.760]   We have to have policymakers and people meet halfway on this thing.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.640]   I also think that there's a social dynamic that's also worth exploring here, which is
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:06.400]   that we live in a culture where a lot of people spend a lot of time projecting a version of
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:06.960]   themselves.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:16.160]   That version of themselves is mostly meant to accrue social capital to them, but by implication,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.040]   it's to make other people feel envious of them as well.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.000]   That's the wholeâthey'll call it the Instagram phenomenon.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.920]   I just think it's important to acknowledge that we live in a point where there's this
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:34.000]   heightened psychological sensation that everybody else is doing better than you are.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.200]   You have to find these mechanisms of rationalizing and explaining.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.080]   I think that that's also very dangerous.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.040]   Jason, to your point, there is so much respect.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.760]   A lot of the reason why I spend so much time in Italy is my friends here are just very,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.560]   very simple.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.920]   You guys met so many of them.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.760]   Just normal, everyday people.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:54.820]   Happy.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.560]   They're happy.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.200]   I have so much respect for that because they have a balance in their life.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:08.080]   One of the things that defines them is they don't spend time in these media formats that
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.640]   actually exacerbate the sense of being less than everybody else.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.140]   Totally.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:19.280]   I find that to be a consistent thread amongst all of these people that are really well-balanced
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.800]   that at every strata of whatever line you're on, the healthiest people in each of those
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.960]   lines are the ones that actually have a definition of themselves that comes from within, that
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.880]   is multifaceted, that generally includes a deep relationship with one romantic partner,
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.640]   and it includes their kids.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.080]   Everything else is very much secondary.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.560]   It's not defined by where you want to go and where you want to be.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.200]   It's defined by the day you're living.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   I had a great conversation after a lot of wine and tequila and beer and I don't know
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.540]   what else.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.040]   With Drake?
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.680]   At Chamath's wedding, actually.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.180]   Oh, okay.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:58.880]   I forgot the guy's name.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.600]   So, with Drake.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.440]   I said to the guy, this Italian guy, Chamath, I'm sorry, forgot his name.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.080]   Really nice guy.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:10.320]   And we were talking about the difference between Americans and Italians and how the Italians
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.400]   are all about, "Let's just live for today.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.280]   Enjoy our moment.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.320]   Enjoy our experience.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.120]   Enjoy our time."
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.360]   The Americans all just want to talk about where things are going, where we're headed,
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.320]   what we're looking for, what we're trying to achieve.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.320]   And so much about it's the irony is, I've got my brother visiting from Europe this week,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:32.000]   and so much of the conversation difference that we've talked about is in America, we
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.960]   talk about winning.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.200]   It's like everything is a contest.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.320]   Everything is about getting ahead.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.080]   Everything is about a challenge.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.760]   Everything is about what's next.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.960]   How do I get to the next level?
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.440]   Scorecard.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.320]   Scorecard.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.920]   And that's what's made us the greatest entrepreneurial society, the greatest 250 years of progress
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.680]   in human history is that spirit.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.560]   I disagree with that.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.280]   I disagree with that.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.000]   But it also makes you profoundly sad.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.080]   If you only live for the scorecard and not the game, to be sad.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.920]   I don't think entrepreneurs have a scorecard.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.640]   I don't think they're looking at somebody else saying, "I'm going to beat that guy."
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   I don't think that that's where it comes from.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.760]   Forget about the term score.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.800]   Forget about competition.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.480]   Just make it about progress.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.680]   Where am I going?
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   And that we orient ourselves around where are we headed versus where are we today.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.360]   Just enjoying this moment that you have today.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.400]   The moment.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.560]   And I think that there's a big cultural difference between the US and the guy I was sitting next
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.680]   to at your wedding, Chamath.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.880]   These folks are just very much about enjoying this experience and not thinking about what's
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.000]   next and where we're going.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   We come in, everyone saunters around.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.920]   No one's thinking about what time we have to start.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.640]   Everyone's just enjoying their time with each other.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.800]   And the Americans are all like, "When are we starting the wedding?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.680]   When are we doing this?
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.400]   When are we doing that?"
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   The litmus test for that, I find, is when you first meet somebody.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:47.840]   And I encourage all of you guys to try to do this, is to not go to, "What do you do?"
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.200]   as the question.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   Right.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.640]   Very American question.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.400]   How long can you go without asking that question?
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.280]   What do you do?
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:03.280]   And I find it's so amazing to actually have conversations with people where that question
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.000]   never comes up.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.200]   You will really, really, really learn a lot about people.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.080]   I think a lot of this also is like, I was watching Senator Tim Scott.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.360]   I'd love to have him on the program.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.800]   I know he's maybe not got the highest percentage right now.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.160]   And we got a bunch of other candidates coming on the program, by the way, for the audience.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:29.200]   But I was just taken back by, I saw Joy Behar or whatever the host of The View is.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:29.760]   Joy Behar.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.120]   And Joy Behar.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.800]   And she was just admonishing him that he doesn't understand systematic racism.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   He's a Black man.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.800]   And he's like, "I am the product of the American system.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.240]   I'm proud of where I got to."
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:52.560]   And she was, she's constantly trying to make him feel worse that the conditions are terrible.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:58.160]   It's funny because it's basically somebody basically saying that Tim Scott is not allowed
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.760]   to be proud of his journey.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.400]   Basically.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.040]   That's what she did.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.200]   Whose right is that?
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.640]   Just take the win.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.560]   Like, just let him, you know.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.400]   It's really weird.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.120]   And I just want to take one other moment from the song.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:15.200]   Because this song got pegged as like, maybe it's propaganda.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.000]   I don't know if it is.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Maybe this guy, people started doing their like, how do we take this guy down?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.800]   Like the left and the right lunatics, you know, on the fringe always try to do.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.200]   Something happens that's nice or, you know, whatever.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.400]   We got to take the person down.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.080]   And maybe the guy is a lunatic.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.560]   Who knows?
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.520]   He's just an artist to me.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:36.000]   But he liked or had a playlist of 9/11 conspiracy theories.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.960]   But he says here in the song, Lord, we got folks in the street.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.080]   Ain't got nothing to eat.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.800]   And the obese milk and welfare.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:50.880]   Well, God, if you're 5'3" and you're 300 pounds, taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.360]   rounds.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.200]   Talking about the welfare state.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.760]   Young men are putting themselves six feet in the ground because all this damn country
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.680]   does is keep kicking them down.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.880]   Referencing, I think, you know, Jordan Peterson and the suicide rate amongst young men and
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.120]   their hopelessness and, you know, et cetera.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.520]   And it's very hard.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.200]   I think I would encourage people to be careful trying to pin this as a left or a right song.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.720]   This is about, you know, working class people feeling frustrated with the system was my
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.280]   read on it.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   And maybe even fighting back and taking a little bit of their power.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.960]   But a great song.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.920]   Congratulations to him.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.400]   And I hope he writes some more tunes.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:36.320]   Reminded me of pick a song like the river by Bruce Springsteen or Telegraph Road by
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:36.960]   Dire Straits.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.000]   Just so many great songs about the working man.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.120]   Congratulations on hitting number one and everybody else can tear it down.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.400]   And in the comments, you can tell us we're out of touch, even though we moved up the
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:46.880]   lines.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:52.160]   I think that's, by the way, why some people like this show and, you know, is because maybe
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.000]   we did move up a couple of lines and maybe we might have a perspective at some point
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.240]   in, you know, how to do that.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.520]   Let's move on, I guess.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.120]   I think everybody got their shot at this.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:01.440]   All right.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.000]   The big short to Michael Burry.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.400]   He just made a bet against the markets.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.000]   This was trending.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.400]   I'm not sure how much of this is all true, but there's been some reporting on it.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:20.240]   Burry's fund has recently bought 866 million and put options against the S&P and 739 million
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.160]   puts against the NASDAQ.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.280]   These are headline numbers on the SEC.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.800]   There's probably more to it.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.960]   Contacts, obviously, we all know the markets ripped.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.720]   NASDAQ up 37% this year, S&P up 15% this year.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.560]   Inflation getting cracked.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.840]   GDP looking strong.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.120]   Unemployment on the floor.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.720]   Number of job openings still above 9.x million.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.920]   Pretty crazy to think about how resilient this economy is with pockets of disastrous
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.240]   stuff.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.840]   But what's your take on this free bird?
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.400]   Yeah, I think the reporting is a little wrong on this.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:58.640]   So this came out of a 13F filing and on the 13F filing, you, when you report option
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:03.280]   contracts, remember each option contract represents 100 underlying shares.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:09.360]   And you don't have to talk about the strike or the expiry on the option contract when
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.400]   you do the 13F filing.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.040]   So we don't actually know what the strike or the expiry is on the option.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:19.520]   That dollar amount that's being reported is when they take the number of option contracts,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.560]   multiply it by 100, which is how many shares per contract, and then just use the price
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.000]   on the actual underlying the index.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.760]   He may have paid a dollar an option.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.640]   He may have bought an option that was three years out, way out of the money.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.280]   It could be much smaller.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.640]   It could be a short term contract that's just a near term hedge on the portfolio.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.160]   And we have no idea how much the actual dollar value of the contract is.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.280]   It could be really way out.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.400]   It could be just be a short term hedge.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:50.320]   So we really don't know directionally or magnitudinally how significant this is.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.760]   So it's a bit of a misreporting.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.480]   Without knowing the strike and the expiry, we don't know how much he actually spent buying
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.280]   these puts.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.800]   And what the bet really means.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.080]   Is it a near term bet or long term?
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.240]   And what percentage of his portfolio, right?
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.640]   You don't have to disclose in a 13F what your short positions are.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:11.120]   And so all you have to do is disclose what your ownership is.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.240]   So my suspicion is that Michael probably has what's called a short straddle on.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.880]   And so a short straddle is when you're basically selling a call and you're buying a put.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.360]   And so we've talked about these a lot, which is instead of taking a naked exposure for
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.200]   $1.6 billion, which seems very.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:32.640]   Aggressive and risk on and he's not the type of guy, if you look at his trading activity
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.200]   that does that kind of stuff, his typical positions are 50 basis points, 80 basis points,
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.640]   100 basis points.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.920]   So he's not a big risk taker.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.160]   So what he probably has on is what's called the short straddle.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:48.400]   And what you don't have to disclose in these 13Fs is the other side of the trade where
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.200]   you're short a call.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.680]   And so I suspect that's what that is.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   So this is a big much ado about nothing.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.480]   It's good headlines in a moment where there's not much to talk about.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:03.760]   It's August and the media, you know, this is the media business losing its business
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.240]   model and Google and Facebook taking all their revenue and Craigslist and Facebook, you know,
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.520]   marketplace taking all their.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.240]   And Michael, by the way, Michael can go on Twitter and tell us that we're wrong, but
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.800]   I'm sure he's got a short straddle.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.000]   Didn't he go off Twitter?
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.040]   He's like done with Twitter.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.280]   He goes on and off and he auto deletes his tweets.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.800]   So I set a Zapier up.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.040]   Anytime he tweets, it puts it in a Slack room for me.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.280]   Have you guys noticed the quantity of wine I'm drinking?
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:25.840]   This is my second.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.560]   Yeah, I know.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.920]   We're getting a little worried here.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.120]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.240]   You got ice cubes in that?
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:30.560]   Can I?
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.600]   No, but let me just say this.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.400]   Look, I'm back in the United States next week.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.160]   So this is the end of the vacation.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.520]   The end of the vacation, yeah.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:42.000]   It's end of a one month where I don't exercise except for swimming and walking.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.720]   I eat gelato every day and I drink wine every day.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.840]   So this is the end.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.480]   And then I'm back.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.520]   What's the weight difference?
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.800]   Day one to day 30.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.000]   What's day one to day 30?
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.920]   Look at that perfectly chilled Montrachet.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.120]   Look at that.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:53.760]   The glass is perfectly chilled.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.520]   I can see the condensation.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.840]   I see the condensation from beer.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.120]   I've gained two and a half kilos.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.600]   So what is that?
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.480]   Five pounds?
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:02.960]   Six pounds.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.520]   That's fine.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.080]   That's livable.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.640]   That's livable.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.160]   I have a moderate four pack.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.000]   That's two weeks of Monjar, no big deal.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:08.720]   Yeah, no, you'll be good.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.320]   You'll be back in the game with a little bit of it.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.440]   We'll get you back in the game, kid.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.160]   I'm going to see J.K. Allen in about an hour.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.000]   Freeberg and I are going on a love walk.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.920]   But you know, we have a lot of romantic moments.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.800]   So we're just going to do a little.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.000]   Can I shift the very short back into it?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   Before I just my last point on the breathing,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.560]   the media needs to do a better job of making sure they understand these things just a bit,
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.880]   because the headline is just a little bit weird.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.200]   Totally.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.400]   Without knowing all the context.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.800]   Like it's very hard to be a finance writer, you know, because if you're a great finance writer,
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.200]   you could be in finance and be a capital allocator.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.520]   Oh, hey, kids.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.280]   Where's the monkeys?
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:45.920]   Where are the monkeys?
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.320]   I'm so sorry.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:46.880]   I'm so sorry.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.200]   Hold on.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:47.440]   Hold on.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:47.520]   Hold on.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.960]   Get an enchilada.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.520]   Let me fix it.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.800]   Let me fix.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.600]   Where's the gelato?
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:58.640]   Oh, you know, you know, these two kids this past week were literally like jumping.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.480]   There was a light that was the camera.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.920]   They were jumping in the sea.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   These two kids were swimming without any help whatsoever.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.440]   It was the most incredible thing to see when little kids learn how to swim.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.320]   Isn't it joyous?
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.760]   It's joyous.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.720]   It's joyous.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.600]   It's joyous.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.720]   Okay, back to you guys.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:16.960]   Sorry.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.920]   Back to me.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.400]   I love you.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:18.800]   No, I love you.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.360]   Bye bye.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.240]   Bye bye.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.560]   Let's talk about wealth disparity from the Italian coast.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:30.320]   All right, Zach, with your $500 Montclair hat, let's talk about wealth disparity.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:30.640]   Go.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.360]   No, it's my point.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.320]   It's not about wealth disparity.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:32.800]   Okay, sorry.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.280]   Sorry.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:38.560]   I think we should follow up on where the economy is right now and what the macro situation is like
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.040]   and why Michael Burry might want to short the market.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.520]   Yes.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:48.960]   So in terms of where things stand today, I think the consensus view of the street is that
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   inflation is largely in the rearview mirror.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.120]   It was down to 3% last month.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:58.480]   And the bet now, I think, is that it will continue to remain low.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.520]   It will be in this 2.5% to 3% range at the end of the year.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.360]   And therefore, the Fed will be able to cut rates next year.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.160]   And the market has rallied quite a bit in anticipation of that.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.920]   I think that is the consensus view.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.520]   I think there are at least two really big risk factors to that.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.600]   One is that inflation could still rebound.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.280]   We haven't really gotten that many months of good inflation data.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.720]   And if inflation ticks back up, if there's another wave of it in the next several months,
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.320]   then there will not be rate cuts next year.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:31.440]   And that means if its rates are higher than anticipated, valuations come down.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.280]   So that would be a big risk factor to the market.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.960]   The other big risk factor is, I think, in the real economy.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:42.960]   It's true that the economy does not seem to be hurt so far by these huge interest rate
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.000]   hikes that we've had.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:50.160]   However, there is typically a big lag in the impact on the real economy of rate hikes.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:55.520]   And I think you could still see these rate hikes take effect over the next several months.
[00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.160]   And you could see a real dip in the economy, potentially a recession.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.480]   And that would be a big risk factor to the markets.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.880]   Because right now, the markets are pricing in a soft landing or no landing.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.600]   They're pricing it.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.040]   We're just going to do a flyby.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.080]   Right.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.160]   So what is the evidence that there might be a lag?
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.360]   Well, a couple of things.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.520]   And it really has to do with real estate, which I think is the most impacted asset class
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.640]   by rate hikes.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.680]   You saw that the mortgage rate is the highest it's been in over 20 years.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.880]   Yeah, since '97.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.760]   7.09%.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.640]   And the rates I'm seeing in Florida and other places, mortgages are like 8%.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.280]   Well, if it's going to cost you 8% to buy a new house, and it used to be 3% a couple
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.600]   of years ago, you're not going to be able to afford to buy that same level of house.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.520]   And you can't afford to sell your current house and buy a new one, because your current
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.480]   house is financed at 3%.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.480]   You're not going to give up that mortgage to trade it into an 8% mortgage.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:57.040]   So we're already seeing a huge reduction in the number of transactions in residential
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.760]   real estate.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.360]   And so that means that we're not seeing a lot of fresh marks in terms of where prices
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.000]   are.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.320]   But that doesn't mean the valuations haven't gone lower.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.200]   I think that as this washes through the system, you could see a big correction in the values
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.640]   of residential real estate, which is most people's main asset.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.160]   So I think there's a big risk factor there.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.680]   The other big risk factor is on the commercial real estate side.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.160]   There was an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal about distress funds are forming
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.800]   in anticipation of a lot of commercial real estate projects basically going under.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.840]   So the vultures on Wall Street are going to be looking to scoop up these projects.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:41.040]   I think the really interesting thing about commercial real estate right now is multifamily.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.560]   Until now, the conversation has all been about office space.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.680]   And we know that office space is impaired because of the high vacancy rates that the
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.480]   sector just hasn't come back the same way since COVID.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.120]   Right, exactly.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.560]   But now we're starting to see real distress in the multifamily sector.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.480]   Now, why has this happened?
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.600]   Because multifamily is full.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.720]   There's no vacancy problem.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.720]   Yeah, it's hard to get a home.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.200]   And more people would be renting if mortgages are high.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:07.520]   So explain why that is.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.040]   The problem is not on the demand side.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.480]   The problem is in the capital stack.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.120]   So let me describe the problem of what's happened here is,
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:19.040]   let's say that you are a real estate developer who bought multifamily.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.120]   You bought it at a certain price level.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.200]   Let's say you financed it two-thirds with debt.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.440]   You now need to go out and refinance that project.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.880]   Because let's say you did a value add.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.200]   Let's say you basically did some improvements to it.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.040]   That means you didn't put long-term debt on it.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.320]   You can't put long-term debt on a project that's not stabilized yet.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.600]   If you want to do value add work to it, you get what's called a construction loan for
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.880]   two or three years.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.360]   So there's a lot of real estate developers who need to go out right now and finance
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.960]   these projects that they bought.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.960]   And they bought these projects at the top of the market.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.560]   So let's say you're going out now to refinance.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.800]   First of all, the rates are much higher.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.520]   You're looking at paying 8% or 9% instead of the 3% to 4% that you had pencilled in
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.720]   your model a couple of years ago.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.960]   Moreover, there's another problem, which is potentially even worse, which is loan to value.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.800]   You had basically gotten two-thirds loan to value a couple of years ago, but values were
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.680]   much higher.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:20.640]   Now values are lower because, again, multiples have shrunk as interest rates have gone up.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.760]   And so the amount that you can finance is much lower.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.080]   So you either have to top that off by coming out of pocket with your own equity, or you
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   have to go to one of these mezzanine funds.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.680]   So now there's these mezz funds.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.640]   They are total sharks.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.760]   And they're going to charge you not 8% or 9%, but like 15%.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.880]   So your capital stack is completely upside down.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.040]   You thought that you could borrow all this money really cheaply, but now it is super
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.840]   expensive.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.480]   And this project no longer pencils, meaning you're underwater.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.240]   You've got negative leverage on the project.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.640]   And so I think you're going to see, again, not just impaired office space, now impaired
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.440]   multifamily.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.200]   And there is not, I think, a sector of real estate developer who is not in distress right
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.520]   now if they need financing in the next year or two.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.560]   Stacks, what do you do-
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:06.960]   What do you do-
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.080]   You get a better rate from Hesh.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.720]   Right.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.920]   David, David, what do you do if you're long these assets?
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.720]   Do you just default on them and just give them back to the bank?
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:21.360]   One major real estate guy told me that the big guys like Blackstone, the words he used
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.480]   was they are throwing their keys at the bank.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.280]   Meaning they are so underwater, they're not even going to bother trying to figure out
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.320]   a workout.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.280]   They're just going to give the key.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.760]   They're just going to say to the bank, "You own this asset now," and they're going to
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.880]   move on to the next fund.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.360]   There's actually-
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.320]   That was his take, at least.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:36.960]   That was his take.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.160]   You sent a tweet to the group chat about the last line of hope, which was called the hope
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.680]   note, which is where one of these mezz financiers just takes your property, and then if they
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:54.880]   happen to hit your high watermark again later on, that you would get some idiot insurance
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.640]   and get a little taste of the sale.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.800]   Shmaab, you had a tweet about the housing.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.840]   What's your take?
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.320]   Well, no, my only thought around housing was that, very much just supporting what Sacks
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:09.920]   just said, we're in an incredibly untenable situation, mostly because as rates go up,
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.720]   mortgage applications go down, and so what you're seeing is just the number of people
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.400]   trying to transact is very small, and so the inventory is very small.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:24.720]   Sacks said it well, so I don't really have much to add, except that when you think about
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:30.400]   where this lands squarely in terms of the wealth creation that it's supposed to represent
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.720]   for most Americans, it's a very difficult situation.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.080]   It's frozen, yeah.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.800]   I actually think the ... People talk about the political pressure from the White House
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:47.760]   to the Fed, and I think that this actually is probably a very powerful lens with which
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:55.200]   to look at it, and the reason is because this touches all voters in every state across all
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.520]   political lines, and I think when people talk about is the economy doing well or is the
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.200]   economy not doing well, and as a result, where are your political leanings, I think something
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.280]   like this actually represents a much larger percentage of how people represent whether
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.920]   they feel they're doing well than any other thing, even earnings, quite honestly, because
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:19.520]   I think that a home is just such a fundamentally visceral psychological component of safety.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.440]   And a large percentage are well, and 60% of people own one, and the people who own one
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.840]   are the people who vote, so it may only be 60% of people, but it might be 80% of voters.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.720]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.200]   I think that could probably very well be true.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:40.560]   My only point in that was just more that this could actually, if the Fed is susceptible
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.280]   to political pressure, I think this is the kind of thing that pressures them to move
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.080]   forward the point at which they start cutting and to start to let go of the release valve
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.880]   just because there's just too much pressure in the system if you let this stuff build.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.920]   Yeah, there's talk of them doing a safety rate hike, doing another 25 bips at the end
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.000]   of the year just to be safe, and I think one of the things we've learned here is --
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.720]   I don't think the data really supports that, to be honest with you.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:13.520]   But they've made poor decisions this whole time, and this is not like the Fed's impact
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.520]   with this tool is not like driving a car where you hit the accelerator, you hit the brake,
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.200]   and you get an immediate reaction.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.040]   This is more like driving a train where it takes a little while to get up to speed,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.120]   and if you slam on the brakes, this thing can come off the rails, and that's the scary
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:27.600]   part for me.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:33.040]   Just to build on what Zak said, the most interesting thing about this for me is that
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.800]   typically we think about the Fed as being very silent in election years.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.560]   They really don't try to get that involved mostly because they don't want to seem like
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.240]   they're tipping in an election one way or the other.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.520]   The problem that we have is that rates are at a near-term high.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.320]   The tenure is ratcheting up faster than we ever expected.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.960]   It's rallied in terms of rates meaningfully more than anybody thought since the beginning
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.360]   of the year.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:04.720]   So now we're in this odd position where will the Fed cut, and why will they cut?
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.840]   If they cut, will they cut sooner than they would have?
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.880]   If they hold on, is it that they just want the country to enter a recession, in which
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.200]   case they want to see "regime change"?
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.840]   It's a very interesting set of financial and political politics that I don't think
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.040]   we've seen in recent years.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.240]   Yeah, well, there's a lot of real estate developers who are literally hanging on by
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.360]   their fingernails, and they're hoping and praying for a rate cut.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.640]   The problem they're going to have is that even if inflation doesn't rebound, even if
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.680]   the Fed does cut rates next year, the rate that the Fed cuts is the short rate.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.120]   It's basically the Fed funds rate.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.960]   That's at 5.5% right now.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.760]   Even if they cut that to call it 3% to 4% next year, there's no guarantee that the
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.480]   tenure rate, which is what real estate developers get financed on, will move down.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.560]   The tenure rate is what is it now?
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.280]   At 4.5%?
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:55.780]   4.5%.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.160]   Something like that.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.600]   And that rate may not come down.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.360]   A lot of economists are worrying about this.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.280]   Larry Summers is worried about this because the federal government has such huge financing
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.080]   needs.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.360]   And so just because short rates come down, there's no guarantee that the long rate is
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.000]   going to come down.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.480]   And so there may not be this relief that real estate developers are looking for next year.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.280]   And again, there's this wall of debt that has to be refinanced.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.200]   I'll give you an example from my own portfolio.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.160]   I have a building.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.360]   Just to simplify.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.360]   You've got a couple of buildings, but okay.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.000]   You're talking about one of them.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.920]   I've got a building that's worth about $15 million.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.040]   It's an office building, okay?
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.280]   There's a $9 million loan on it that is coming up to be refinanced at the end of the year.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.760]   So I'm talking to the lender about rolling it over.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.840]   And what they agreed to do, here are the terms.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.920]   They agreed to give me $2.4 million out of the nine secured by the building.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.720]   That's it.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.160]   They wouldn't roll over the nine.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.680]   They'd only give me $2.4.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.960]   For the other $6.6, they wanted me to post additional collateral in the form of public
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.920]   securities.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.640]   So they basically wanted me to fully collateralize the loan.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.920]   So in other words, they're adding a margin account on top of a commercial real estate
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.160]   loan.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:02.800]   That's exactly right.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.440]   That's exactly right.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.480]   So they want me to over collateralize the building with a bunch of securities.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.080]   Why do you need a loan for that?
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.040]   It's not a real estate loan.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.400]   It's not a real estate loan.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.800]   And they want me to personally guarantee it.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.720]   Why don't you just sell the shares and buy the...
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.440]   You just sold a participating preferred in your building.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.000]   What the fuck?
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.480]   Right.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.520]   No, he took out a margin loan on his own security portfolio.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.200]   So what I said is, "Listen, I don't need this loan.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.080]   I'm just going to pay it off.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.000]   So I'm going to pay off items in the loan and I'll just own the building 100%.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.240]   And when this credit crunch is over, whether it's next year or two years from now, I'll
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.600]   just refi it then."
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.240]   But here's the thing.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.680]   The average developer can't do that.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.760]   Like, how do they go out and get that extra $9 million?
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.160]   Let's just point out the opportunity cost to you.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.000]   You could buy treasuries that pay you 5.5%.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.200]   So your actual cost on that capital that you're using to finance the building yourself to
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:59.600]   buy the debt is costing you 5.5% a year of risk-free income for the $9 million.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.120]   It's not a pleasant situation.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.800]   It's something that I can manage through.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:07.280]   But my point is that this is something that's going to be afflicting pretty much every real
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.760]   estate developer needs to refinance in the next year or so.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.240]   And they don't have what you have, which is the value.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:12.960]   They don't have the backstop.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.360]   They don't have the chip stack.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.880]   And by the way, my real estate guys tell me that this deal that I got offered is a good
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.680]   deal right now.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.180]   Oh!
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.920]   It's a good deal.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.560]   Because lenders...
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.120]   Yeah, that's a good deal.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.280]   At least they were trying to be flexible and work with me.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.600]   Most of these lenders, they're just not even open for business.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.640]   I heard there's just no bid.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.520]   I mean, these guys I know that work in commercial real estate debt said they're putting out
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.720]   these syndicated loan proposals to the typical funders and there's no bid.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.320]   They're like, "Well, just tell me the rate."
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.200]   They're like, "There is no rate.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:41.920]   There's just no bid."
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.840]   Well, interesting news.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.480]   We've been talking a little bit about these bond offerings, etc.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:55.360]   And the US is, with the higher yield, still continuing to draw buyers.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.160]   Japan, very soft in terms of getting people to buy their securities.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.720]   And $127 billion this year into funds that invest in treasuries.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.400]   On pace for a record year, Bank America Corp said last week.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.560]   All right, let's move on to...
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.240]   We got Nvidia left on the docket.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.840]   We got Hopin as a peak Zerp.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.160]   The founder sold out a lot of shares.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.920]   Let's pick one of these stories.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.480]   Or we got the SBF, which is going to be big drama next year when this goes to court.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.600]   Or, facts, we could go.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600]   Those are the stories.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.560]   There's not a lot of meat on them.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.520]   I think let's just spend five minutes...
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.600]   Trump, should we do the indictment?
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.720]   Giving you your red meat.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.400]   Oh, me giving me my red meat?
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.000]   I think five minutes of you ranting and doing your TDS and then we can wrap.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.040]   All right, well, listen, I don't want to speak to your TSS, your Trump Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.920]   But I will say that Trump, yes, has his fourth indictment.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.120]   You thought the hat trick was a lot?
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.160]   Well, now he's got four.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.720]   Fulton County, Georgia, 13 felony counts.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.320]   But this one's incredible.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.480]   It's got a lot of co-conspirators.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.800]   And all I'll say is there is a small town in Georgia.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.000]   Coffee is, I think, the name of it.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.880]   And there are a bunch of election machines and a group of this whack pack went in there
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.200]   and committed a bunch of cyber crimes accordingly.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.840]   And it's not clear yet, but when this thing goes to trial, just keep an eye on that.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:27.040]   There's an incredible lawfare article, and we'll put it in the show notes, and a podcast.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.440]   But I think that opening up the aperture of it is what's really interesting to me.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.760]   What I'm seeing is, I think there's a lot of viable, moderate,
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   Republican candidates that would appeal to somebody like me.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.880]   I have voted 25% Republican, 75% a Democrat.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.440]   I'm a moderate, but left-leaning moderate, I would say, on social issues,
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.400]   on fiscal issues.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.920]   I'm definitely in the Republican camp.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.960]   But I'm looking at Christie.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.000]   I'm looking at the VEC.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.320]   I'm looking at a lot of those kind of Republicans, even Tim Scott, and saying,
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.480]   you know what, maybe that's a better choice than Biden, who is very senile.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:07.760]   And I think the Republican Party has its moment right now to disassociate itself and say,
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.880]   enough with the Meshuggah, enough of Trump.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.920]   And you're starting to see Pence come out very strongly, and Sachs.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.680]   The VEC is still bootlicking, I think, and is still trying to get the VP spot with Trump.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.880]   I think it's a huge mistake.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:26.960]   And I think, Christie, and maybe it's time for your guy, DeSantis,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.160]   who is in the pardon camp as well, but maybe it's time for him to,
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.840]   you know, maybe start criticizing him.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.920]   And then I think it's time to negotiate a pardon for both Trump and Hunter Biden.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.480]   Pardon both of them, get him out of political life, and let's move on as a country.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.360]   I believe that you're going to see Chris Christie and the VEC surge.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.880]   It's going to be a three-horse race with DeSantis, and I think Trump's going to be
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.440]   out of the race in the next six to 12 months.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.240]   That's just my prediction.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.200]   Your thoughts, Sachs?
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.360]   Well, I want to give you a chance here to expound on your blue meat.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   Not red meat.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.080]   For you, it's blue meat.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:02.560]   Blue meat.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.040]   Your TDS is flaring up again, Jason.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:05.600]   I think it's losing.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.160]   No, no.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.040]   No TDS.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.280]   So let me ask you to expound on this pardon theory, because you claim that you think that
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.360]   Trump is now playing for a pardon, that that's his big blank.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.640]   I think he's playing for a pardon, yes.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.960]   Can you explain that?
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.000]   How do you get from here to there?
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.200]   Yeah, so I think he is going to go buck wild.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.640]   He is, you know, lashing out, et cetera.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:30.240]   In the hopes that he can cause so much chaos, because you're seeing him, you know, with
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.840]   these tweets that are kind of border-lighting on violence and inciting people, gag orders,
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.560]   that kind of stuff.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.680]   I think he's going to keep pushing the envelope to the point at which he breaks the Republican
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.360]   party, makes Americans really burnt out, because the Republicans can't win with him.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.120]   He's got like 30% support or whatever.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.320]   He's not going to beat Biden.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.120]   You've said that before.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.080]   I think everybody knows it.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.800]   He's the weakest candidate in the field.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.920]   And I think you guys really want to get a win and you want to move past him.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.720]   So I think this combination of the Republican party flipping on him, and you're starting
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.400]   to see the crack, you know, and people starting to criticize him.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.000]   Once the evidence comes out, and people see him in court, and people hear the details
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   of his criminal behavior, his abhorrent behavior, his behavior that Vivek, Governor Christie,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.640]   you know, either side of the aisle would never participate in, I think there's going to be,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.760]   kind of the United States is going to say, you know what, pardon him, blanket pardon
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.240]   if he just steps out of public life.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.960]   And I think Biden's going to need a pardon too for Hunter.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.880]   And so I think this could be the solution for everybody to move forward.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.640]   It sounds crazy, but I think that the stuff that's going to come out is going to be much
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.080]   worse than Watergate specifically.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.280]   You know, again, I'll reference the article of some of the behavior of his whack pack
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.240]   and what they were doing, you know, in Coffey County, like the beverage, Coffey County,
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:50.800]   Georgia.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.400]   When you start hearing what they did, you know, lying, forging documents, and basically
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:04.000]   committing computer crimes, this woman who Trump, Sidney Powell, Trump put his fate in
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.840]   Sidney Powell and Giuliani is a critical era.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.840]   And I think it's all going to blow up in his lap.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.920]   These people were lunatics, they were committing crimes, and I think they're going to get him.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.360]   And I think he's going to need a pardon.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   So he's not built for jail.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.800]   I can tell you Trump is not built for jail.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.760]   Well, this is one problem with your theory, Jason.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.260]   Go ahead.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.720]   President can't pardon state crimes.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.600]   That is true.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.680]   I think they could be a grand negotiation.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.880]   This Georgia Rico indictment can't be pardoned.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.520]   Well, however, I do think that there could be a plea.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.760]   And so this could plea out, I think they probably want to plead out every well, all people want
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.560]   to plead this stuff out, right?
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.200]   Both sides.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.840]   That's all the conspiracy what you're about to talk about.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.400]   I know.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.760]   And you know what, if you want to talk about deep state conspiracies and Saks believes
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.000]   in this deep state conspiracy, here's a conspiracy.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.200]   I just think that you can think rationally when it comes to this stuff.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.880]   Okay, fine.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.960]   You didn't know that Biden appointed Merrick Garland.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.160]   You didn't know that these Georgia Georgia crimes can't be pardoned.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.520]   You don't have a federal and a state crime.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.240]   Of course I do.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:06.800]   Of course I do.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.520]   I've talked about it being not pardonable before.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.080]   I think there is going to be a grand reconciliation.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.600]   I think everybody's going to get together and say, how do we move on?
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.680]   And that might even be underway right now.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.200]   The one thing that's definitely not going to happen is Trump takes a plea deal.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.040]   He's going to fight this to the bitter end.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:23.840]   We got to leave this in.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.960]   This is great.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:25.760]   You know what's going to happen?
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.360]   I said it back in August last year.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:34.880]   I said it last August when they raided Mar-a-Lago is that the way they're carrying on with this,
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.920]   these lawfare attacks on Trump, we now have the fourth indictment.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.200]   Apparently he's a mobster.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.360]   They're going after him with a RICO statute that was invented to get organized crime and
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:43.840]   mobsters.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.840]   And apparently these lawyers you relied on as dopey as they were, apparently they're
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.320]   like button men for the mob who have to be indicted as well on this RICO statute.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.920]   I think people can see this for what it is, which is it's a, I'm trying to think of the
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.320]   right word.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.000]   I mean, it's, it's basically lawfare, right?
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.800]   They're bending the law in any way they can to go after Donald Trump.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.120]   And I know that his behavior wasn't, wasn't good in this, but I don't, I don't think it
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:07.760]   was criminal.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.480]   No, I'm part of that.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.120]   A hundred percent.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:11.840]   You don't think it's criminal.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.480]   Okay.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:12.960]   Interesting.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.040]   Let's look at that Fox News poll where they asked...
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.280]   Do you think the Republican party, let me see this, do you think the Republican party
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.400]   is going to cut ties?
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.600]   I think the Fox News poll asked the right question, which is in connection with the
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.520]   efforts to overturn 2020 election, did Donald Trump do something illegal, something wrong,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.320]   not illegal?
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.200]   Nothing seriously wrong.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.280]   I'm in that middle, I'm in the middle bucket.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.720]   I think it was wrong, but not illegal.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.960]   Look, I think that what Democrats are doing with this partisan lawfare is that they are
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.000]   polarizing the outcomes.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.200]   They're either going to send Donald Trump to the big house or to the white house.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.640]   That's what I said back in August last year when they raided Mar-a-Lago, they're going
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.600]   to send him to the big house or the white house.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.640]   I'm here for the pardon.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.600]   I'm here for the pardon.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.800]   Do you think the Republican party is going to support him or do you think they're going
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.400]   to break ties and try to move on?
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   And what do you think they should do as a strategist?
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.080]   I keep trying to explain this.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:08.240]   They see the way in which the law is being misused, is being weaponized in a partisan
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.040]   way to get one of the major candidates for president.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.560]   They're trying to drive him out of the election.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:12.960]   I know.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.040]   Do you think the Republicans are going to stand by him as he goes to court and these
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.840]   trials start happening?
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.560]   I think that there's-
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.000]   They're rallying or cut ties?
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.520]   Of course, they're rallying around him.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.600]   It's ensuring that he will be the nominee.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.400]   Okay.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.960]   I think they're going to cut ties and the Republican party is going to expel him.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.680]   Okay.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.600]   J-Kel, did you not also predict that Jeff Bezos was going to run for president?
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.160]   I think Jeff Bezos will run in his lifetime.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.120]   Not necessarily this one.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.440]   I said, I think Jeff Bezos will run in his lifetime.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:37.920]   I think when you-
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.480]   Jeff Bezos is living his best life on a yacht with-
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:40.960]   I know.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.520]   His hot girlfriend.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.600]   A $500 million yacht.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.280]   You can do that for a nice yacht.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.280]   And then I was like, $500 million?
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.240]   Your yacht delivers his toast every morning.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.040]   Oh, man.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.000]   Give me a break.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.160]   Bezos watched Bob Iger try and get back in the ring.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:54.800]   He realized, uh-uh.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.080]   He'll do five, 10 years.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.680]   He'll do five years max.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.880]   Five years max on a yacht.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.160]   You get bored out of your mind.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:00.800]   It's so crazy.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.320]   My yacht has a support vehicle.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.000]   His yacht has a support country.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:04.960]   And a support-
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.760]   It's called Malta.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.720]   Your support yacht is his being-
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.040]   Five years.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.320]   That's the max you can do on a yacht.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:14.800]   His boat is incredible.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.240]   Saks did one year on a yacht.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.600]   Saks did one year on a yacht.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.560]   Never again.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.040]   He's done.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:19.680]   It's too boring.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.200]   Yachts are boring.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.840]   J. Cal thinks it's a groundswell to put guys with huge yachts in office.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.080]   I don't think so.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.280]   Listen to that song he played.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   No, I think Bezos-
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.200]   You're still on this Bloomberg trip.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.320]   He spent $100 million.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.200]   Oh, man.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.720]   Got to the first question, the first debate.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.440]   Boom, he's out.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.840]   No, he missed his window.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.920]   Man, Bloomberg would have been great.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.600]   I'll go Bloomberg.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.960]   I'll go Jeff Bezos.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.880]   J. Cal's betting on the yacht groundswell.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.720]   I mean, a boy can dream.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.240]   Are you telling me you wouldn't vote for Bezos if he was a candidate?
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:54.880]   Yes.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.200]   Yes.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.160]   Of course you would.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.280]   Would you vote for Bloomberg?
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.480]   Of course you would.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.240]   You want an executive in there.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.440]   That's what the country needs.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.120]   A professional executive.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.040]   Who's your non-traditional candidate, Freeberg?
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.400]   Who would you love most?
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.680]   Who's, you know, not going to obviously run.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.440]   Or like would be a small chance.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:11.920]   Who would you have?
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:12.320]   The guy at sea!
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.640]   Yeah, an economist.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.800]   Someone who's an economist.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.200]   They're just terrible political speakers.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.080]   They're just not good at that.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.360]   Chamath, who would be your wild card?
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.200]   I'm texting Nat to bring me another glass of wine.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:25.680]   Oh, God.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.360]   He's so drunk.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:27.920]   I think we're wrapping up.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.960]   He's on glass four.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.480]   Oh, glass four?
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.840]   That's glass four on air.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.400]   We don't know how many he pre-games.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.240]   Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.280]   I'm going to keep drinking.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:37.920]   He pre-games.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.640]   Saks, who is your wild card?
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.400]   If you had to pick a wild card, non-traditional,
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.560]   not for this election, but for an election.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.920]   Somebody who's not part of it.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.560]   Is it Peter Thiel?
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.920]   RFK or Vivek?
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.560]   RFK or Vivek.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:48.880]   No, no.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.760]   Out of this election.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.400]   Listen, I've supported, either financially or at least verbally,
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.600]   RFK Jr., DeSantis, and Vivek.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600]   I mean, how many more candidates do I have to support?
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.480]   Um, well, okay.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.640]   You guys do me a favor and get going.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.320]   You're clinging to Trump.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.520]   When are you going to unload Trump?
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.800]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.360]   I'm supporting three candidates not named Trump,
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.200]   but for you it's never enough.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.440]   Well, no, I want to hear you throw him into the bus and say,
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.160]   but we'll see.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:14.960]   Someday you will.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.640]   Someday you'll stand up against him.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.160]   I said what he did was wrong.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.240]   I just don't think it was organized crime.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.680]   It wasn't a Rico indictment.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.320]   I want to hear you say he should drop out of the race.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.760]   As an influencer in the party, I want you to say you should drop out.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.720]   That's all I want you to say.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.680]   All right, let's move on.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.640]   How about Dave Portnoy?
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.840]   You want to talk about Dave Portnoy?
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.040]   No, I want to talk about Adyen being down 40% today.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:35.840]   Okay.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.760]   Adyen is a stock with public as a competitor to Stripe.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.240]   Since 2018, this one's incredible.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:52.000]   Since 2018, Adyen has reported every six month period of growth at least 26% or greater,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:01.840]   and they reaffirmed a 65% EBITDA margin, and they were down at one point today 40%.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.300]   Okay.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.640]   Holy cow.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:12.960]   If you look at Adyen, what does it mean about Stripe?
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:19.200]   I think the answer is that Stripe at that $50 billion round, $55 billion round is worth
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.240]   25 billion.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.880]   There's a 50% markdown right there.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.080]   That's a 25-
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:24.880]   It peaked at 100?
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.160]   It peaked at 100?
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.680]   Bill Gurley had a great tweet on this.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.840]   Multiple compression is a bitch.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.360]   Multiple compression.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.440]   Gurley's been saying that for a long time.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.880]   Same thing that's happening in real estate.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:36.880]   The reason why those-
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.760]   It might be a buy.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.560]   It might be a buy.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.640]   The reason those multifamily developers are getting whammied right now is, again, it's
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.600]   not because of vacancy.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.800]   Everyone wants their apartments.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.680]   The problem is multiple compressions.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.960]   The value is much lower, which means they can't get as much debt.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:57.600]   So all of a sudden, they got to pony up a bunch of equity or get expensive mezz to fill out
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.400]   the capital stack.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.880]   This is the problem is there's multiple compression everywhere, and it's just taking time.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:03.360]   Yes.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:03.680]   It's more hate than-
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.800]   Taking time to work through the system.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.840]   This is a train, not a car.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.520]   What is Stripe worth, Saks?
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.560]   David, where do you buy Stripe?
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.360]   I think you're right.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.720]   I think that we have a-
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.680]   25 billion?
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.440]   Almost perfect comp there.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.160]   So yeah, you're right.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.840]   Down 46% year to date.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.480]   That doesn't even include what happened last year, right?
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:22.560]   So I think you're right.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.760]   Stripe revenue 2022-
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.320]   20, 25 billion.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.120]   14 billion.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.600]   The thing to remember about all these businesses, Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, is that they're middleman
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.800]   businesses, which by definition means that they don't have pricing power.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.800]   They actually have to reflect the prevalent pricing power of the incumbent sponsors of
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.520]   their technology.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.480]   So for example, if you have a deal with McDonald's, McDonald's bids you out to five different
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.040]   people, and they pick the cheapest one, right?
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.560]   So your margins over time tend to be compressed.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.320]   And over time, your share of profits tend to be compressed, and you have to give up
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:56.640]   a lot.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.240]   So how do you maintain profitability?
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.720]   So when Adyen maintains 65% EBITDA margins in the face of this revenue decline, the only
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.840]   way they can do that is by cutting staff, using more technology, and creating OPEX leverage
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.680]   that replaces what they're losing.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.400]   So the real takeaway is that this is a very tough, tough business that is a race to the
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.120]   bottom.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:25.280]   And it is a surplus business that benefits the buyer, i.e. the Ubers, the McDonald's,
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.480]   the DoorDashes of the world, not the seller, i.e. the Adyens, the PayPals, the Stripes.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.320]   What's the changing cost?
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.440]   You know, if you're if you're Uber, and you negotiated a deal for three years with
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.240]   Stripe, and then you go to Adyen, and you negotiate your next deal, and they want to
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.000]   win it because they need the top line revenue, and now you got a dogfight, you know, let
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.240]   alone all the other players who are competitors,
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.840]   all race to the bottom businesses.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.680]   And so tough business, tough business,
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.280]   if you have a very diffuse business model where you're trying to do too many things.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.680]   And so as a result, you have a somewhat bloated OPEX relative to a company that's going to
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.440]   do a lot less, but do it just much better.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.840]   I think you're going to be very challenged.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.680]   Yeah, well, you know, this could be the buying opportunity for a lot of these equities,
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:08.800]   if you believe in them long term.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.280]   So Dan Loeb is placing a bunch of bets.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:15.360]   He bought some Uber, he bought NVIDIA, you know, he's out there buying up stuff.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.720]   So we'll see.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.520]   Let's talk about Dayport.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.880]   And I think this is like a very interesting one.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.760]   We didn't get to it last week.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.600]   Penn Gaming, a gambling company and gambling has become legal in the United States.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.000]   Sports wagering has been accepted by the NBA, ESPN, TV shows, everything.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.600]   It's been incorporated into.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600]   I've been gambling for fucking 30 years.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.120]   Of course, but now it's been integrated into.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.000]   What the fuck?
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.440]   Jamaa, did you know the funniest?
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.480]   He's on Glass 4.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.600]   All the buttons are off.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.720]   All the buttons are gone.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.480]   The funniest thing is when I bought a piece of the Warriors,
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.960]   the funniest thing was I got a call from the NBA,
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.520]   because you have to submit like this huge application,
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.240]   like, you know, everything, open the kimono.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.920]   And they knew that I was a big fucking sports bettor.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.520]   And they were like, "Hey, dipshit, we'll allow you to sports bet in Vegas
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.800]   if you show the tickets."
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.000]   But otherwise, you know, they knew who my bookie was.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.080]   They were like, "You cannot call this guy anymore.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.680]   You can't sports."
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.800]   It was crazy.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.000]   Well, then I caught call.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.580]   OK.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.760]   Don't bar.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.320]   Did you say his name?
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.280]   Don't say his fucking name.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:17.780]   I said.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.500]   So, Nick, Nick, delete the fucking.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.500]   Nick, delete the first part.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.780]   Don't fucking do that.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.020]   That's a small.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.540]   Wrap it.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.580]   Come on, we got to go.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:33.300]   Let's go.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.020]   Four.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.300]   I really miss you guys.
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.500]   I really do.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:36.980]   I miss you.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.100]   I love you guys so much.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.660]   I love you.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.700]   I love you guys.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.740]   No, I really love you guys.
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.220]   And I miss you.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.100]   I love you.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.460]   I can't wait to come back.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:46.500]   I can't wait to be back.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.380]   But there's denial.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.180]   Listen, Paul.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.580]   All right, so am I going to see you when I get to L.A.?
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.420]   I'd like to see you.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:52.920]   Sure.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:53.700]   I'll come see you.
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:54.420]   When do you get here?
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:54.920]   Thursday?
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.100]   No, Wednesday.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.600]   Wednesday.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.740]   Oh, yeah, I'm here.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.940]   Probably at the group chat with Drake.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:01.300]   Shout out to Drake.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.500]   J.K. and I have a lunch date.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.060]   We got to go.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.820]   OK, so four.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:12.260]   The queen of quinoa, the sultan of science, the architect, the sasshole himself, and the dictator.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:12.980]   Chamath.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:13.780]   I love you guys.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.060]   Drunky monkey.
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.100]   Chamath probably happy to you.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:16.600]   I am.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.100]   Undoubtedly the world's greatest moderator.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:20.900]   We'll see you next time.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:22.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:26.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:29.320]   (I'm going, I'm going all in)
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.400]   and instead we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.240]   (Love you, West Key)
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.740]   I'm the queen of Quinoa
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.460]   (I'm going all in)
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.140]   What your winners like? What, what your winners like?
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.360]   (I'm going all in)
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.740]   Besties, I'm golf 13
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.260]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:50.260]   He sucks (laughs)
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:50.800]   Oh man
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.100]   My avatar will meet me at blue
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.700]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy cause we're all just useless
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.700]   It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.900]   What your, that'll be, what your, be
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.900]   What your, be
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:05.900]   Be, that's gonna be good
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:06.900]   We need to get merch
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:07.900]   Besties are back
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:08.900]   (I'm going all in)
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   (I'm going all in)
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.960]   you
