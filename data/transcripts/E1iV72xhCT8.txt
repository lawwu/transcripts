[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - All right, what do we got next?
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.520]   - All right, the next question's from Drew.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.440]   He's in a gap year and he has a question
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   on what activities he should pursue.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.880]   - Hey, Cal, loving the show.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.240]   I'm Drew from the Philippines
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.000]   and I'm currently in a gap year before college.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.480]   I've applied to elite universities in the US
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.980]   and I'm pretty confident I'll get into at least one of them.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.480]   Hopefully, but in the meantime,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360]   I'm trying to make the most of my time during my gap year.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.960]   My country is still in the dying throes of the pandemic,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.660]   so going outside is still a bit restricted.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.680]   So I've started developing a lifelong habit
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.080]   of reading books at a more frequent level,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.200]   averaging at least one or two nonfiction books per week
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.480]   by employing your method of making it a default activity.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.920]   And it's been working effortlessly so far.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.040]   I have approximately 10 months before college
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.560]   and by the end of my gap year,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.480]   I want to come out of it becoming the best possible version
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.800]   that a 19 year old like me is capable of actualizing.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.860]   What activities should I pursue
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.040]   and what kind of mindset should I employ going forward?
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.880]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.400]   - So given that you're somewhat physically stuck,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.160]   that's gonna change the way we think about this gap year.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.360]   Because often gap years is built around experiences.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600]   You go to interesting places, you meet interesting people,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.740]   which I think is really important,
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.760]   but now you're gonna be limited there.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.320]   I think what I'm gonna advise
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.640]   is that you actually develop a curriculum.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.760]   So instead of just, which by the way is great,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.760]   but instead of just encountering and reading a lot of books,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.760]   let's have a curriculum that has maybe three goals
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.240]   that you're gonna make consistent effort towards.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   So you might have a curriculum for reading.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.280]   I'm trying to get through these particular books
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.360]   and I'm gonna read these secondary sources
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.220]   about each of these books
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.380]   to try to fill in a particular subject matter
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.200]   that I wanna know a lot about.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.500]   And I don't care about the details so much here
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.940]   as it is just doing some sort
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.140]   of consistent intellectual exploration.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.440]   I mean, for example, I'll give you an example from my life.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.680]   When I first came down to Washington, DC
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.580]   to take a professorship at Georgetown,
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.740]   this is before we had kids,
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.900]   so I had a lot of free time on my hand.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.660]   My wife worked a normal person job.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.780]   Professorship's not a normal job.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.660]   So she had to actually go to work for normal hours
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.260]   and I didn't, I was a first year professor.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.940]   I did a self-imposed curriculum.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400]   I had come across this book,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.220]   a book of philosophy called "All Things Shining"
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.820]   by Dreyfus and Kelly.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.820]   And it was an interesting book.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.460]   It went back through the classics
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.700]   and extracted ideas from the classics
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.780]   about the sacred and finding meaning in life.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.280]   We actually talked about this recently
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.020]   in my appearance on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.520]   I guess Tim tried to read it
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.180]   and he didn't actually like it much.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.260]   And the reason Tim didn't like it
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.860]   is he said, "I didn't know all the references.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.360]   "I hadn't read Aeschylus.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.700]   "I hadn't read Dante."
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.820]   And so what I did, I said, "Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.200]   "I'm gonna use 'All Things Shining'
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.640]   "'cause it's talking about all these books
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.300]   "and drawing interesting lessons about them.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.280]   "And as it gets to each of those books
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.520]   "that it references, I'm gonna stop and read that."
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.180]   So I'm gonna go, I started with "The Odyssey"
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.600]   because they started with the classical heroic Greeks
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.980]   and I read "The Odyssey" and then I read "Aeschylus"
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.420]   and then I read "Dante" and I read "Augustine."
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.300]   And so I followed this book
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.540]   and I would read the things
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.540]   and then read them talk about it,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.100]   then read the next things and read what they talked about.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.500]   And it was like an organized curriculum
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.620]   and it was actually really interesting to go through these.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.460]   And the book ended up with David Foster Wallace.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.140]   So we went from Homer to David Foster Wallace.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.660]   And there was an organized reflection here
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.380]   as the book went on.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.340]   So do something like that,
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.900]   just to get in the habit of I can on myself
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.460]   autonomously dive into an intellectual pool
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.780]   and make sense of it just because I want to.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.120]   And there's a lot of different topics you can do this on.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.300]   If you wanna steer this,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.460]   you might consider subscribing to the great courses
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.500]   and let one of the great courses,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.100]   you pick a topic from there and let that course,
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.860]   actually watch the lectures and then read the books,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.220]   like actually follow a great course
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.080]   if you want a little bit more structure.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.280]   So that should be part of your curriculum,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   some sort of focused intellectual exploration
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.440]   where you learn to just love doing
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.140]   focused intellectual explorations.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.980]   The second thing in your curriculum
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.340]   should have you building or creating something.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.580]   And I don't know if it's physical, if it's digital,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.980]   if it's written, if it's code,
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.060]   but it's just you're building and honing a skill
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.380]   and creating things,
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.660]   making intentions manifest concretely in the world,
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.020]   just to get in the habit while you have the time
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.940]   of developing a skill and creating things,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.340]   being able to actually add new things into the world.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.020]   I think that's quite fulfilling.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.300]   And then the third part of the curriculum I would add
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.760]   is something physical.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.600]   Get in really good shape.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.940]   Not that you need to be in really good shape
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.700]   to go to college in America,
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.780]   but just that it's an outlet for the energy.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.040]   It will calm intellectual anxieties
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.500]   and it's self-mastery and efficacy.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.460]   I'm the type of guy that can structure my time
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.280]   and get after it.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.120]   I'm getting in really good shape.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.500]   It just makes you feel like you have control
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.140]   over your own life so that when you get there,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.900]   when you get to college, you have all this confidence.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.760]   I can control my life and create something here
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.780]   that's really interesting.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.300]   And I'm not at just the whims of,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.120]   oh my God, my classes and I'm stressed
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.340]   and I'm just up drinking all night.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.500]   You feel like you're actually in control.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.780]   So I would do those three things.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.940]   That's my three-part curriculum I would suggest
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.320]   for your semi-homebound gap year.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.160]   The fourth thing I'm gonna say,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.180]   which is not part of the curriculum,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.300]   but this is just a substrate.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.620]   You need to socialize and connect as much
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.020]   as the Philippine pandemic restrictions allow.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.200]   You need to connect to other people.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.000]   You need to sacrifice on behalf of other people.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.860]   You need to be a leader in your community
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.060]   and among people you know.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.200]   That's just gonna be the foundation
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.340]   that stops you from going crazy.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.420]   If you're allowed to see people outside,
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.860]   see people outside.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.820]   If you're not allowed to do that,
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.320]   then do it virtually until you can.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.620]   But as soon as you can, do that.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.760]   Be around people, see people, communicate with people,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.300]   help people, bring stuff to people who need help.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.180]   Make the social aspect of your life really amplified.
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.080]   And this is not about your gap year.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.900]   This is about you're going through a period
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.500]   of pandemic restrictions that we all went through before.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.440]   And it's the thing that you have to push over the top
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.080]   to counteract the isolating negative impacts
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   of pandemic restrictions.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.640]   And so I just want you to see that as medicine.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.120]   That is your, I don't wanna get anxious
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.200]   and depressed medicine for this very specific circumstance.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.280]   It is, I'm gonna become more socially engaged
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.760]   and sacrifice more time and attention
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.920]   on behalf of other people than I ever have before in my life.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.360]   And that's just your daily medicine.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.440]   All right?
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.420]   So Drew, hopefully things will calm down there soon.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.980]   Hopefully you'll find your way to a nice school soon
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.820]   and really enjoy that.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.300]   But in the meantime, that is my prescription.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.220]   It's kind of weird, Jesse, to imagine there's still,
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.760]   I mean, I guess it's true, but there's places
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.560]   where you're dealing with lockdown type things.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   - Yeah.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.900]   - Yeah, I mean, I think we've been done
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.860]   with those here for a while.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.620]   I think the populace basically just said,
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.020]   you gotta find a better way.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.600]   You gotta find your way.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.680]   Though, I don't know where we live.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.460]   You see it every time you come here,
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.820]   compared to where you live.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.600]   Montgomery County, Maryland is not exactly chill,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.520]   chilled out about the virus.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm in Virginia,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.680]   but it's only seven miles away and it's different.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.560]   - Yeah, interesting times, but hey, we can go outside.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.320]   So I feel bad for Drew.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.120]   - When you were doing that All Things Shining project,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.380]   how long did it take you to do all the,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.080]   read all the books and everything?
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.780]   - I don't remember.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.940]   Semester maybe, more.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.220]   I mean, I don't know if I read every one.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.480]   Maybe I skipped a couple,
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.900]   but I just remember doing it for a lot of that academic year
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.300]   and then I do other things and I'll come back to it.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.540]   Yeah, it's vague memory, but I have all those books still.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.020]   And I remember, by the way, I remember so much from that,
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.880]   that it was very useful.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.700]   Like I have all these references now
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.300]   and these understandings of all these different books.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.820]   I know these cultural references was actually a pretty cool,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.200]   it was a pretty cool experience actually.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.160]   That's what I should have told Tim on the podcast.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.760]   So Tim was saying he tried to read it,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.880]   but found it really academic,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   which it kind of is if you haven't read the books,
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.600]   you're like, what the hell are they talking about?
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.720]   So I probably shouldn't have suggested to Tim,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.940]   go back and try the book again,
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.060]   but read the books along with the writers.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.640]   And so long time fans will recognize the reference
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.160]   because I talk about it in deep work.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.680]   (upbeat music)
