[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Robert from Columbia, South Carolina
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.240]   writes in to ask this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.700]   "I'm wondering if there are situations
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.420]   "in which a separate children's time
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.600]   "in Sunday school rooms,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.460]   "completely apart from the Sunday gathering,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.280]   "are necessary.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.460]   "Our church is wrestling through the issue now
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.800]   "as many families have infants,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.640]   "some have wandering and noisy toddlers.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.840]   "There are rambunctious five-year-olds
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.380]   "and we also have three children of varying ages
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.860]   "with special needs like autism and Down syndrome.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.340]   "The struggle is most parents want a break
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.200]   "and thus desire the separate time for children
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.900]   "while the adult service is going on,
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.520]   "yet the children workers wish they were
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.600]   "in the adult service and feel limited
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.240]   "in their ability to control the behavior of the children.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.840]   "What should we as a church do?"
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.120]   - Well, I hope there's a strong leader in your church
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.800]   because weak leaders will never be able
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   to stand up against the onslaught of a criticism
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.420]   that's gonna come if you try to do what I'm gonna suggest.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.260]   - Oh my.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.000]   - When I came to Bethlehem as a pastor in 1980,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.480]   one of the first issues I had to deal with
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.320]   was about the children in worship
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.880]   and they all wanted to know,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.820]   we didn't have a lot of them,
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.480]   but they were starting to come,
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.320]   what are we gonna do?
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   We're gonna have a children's sermon in the middle,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.320]   a little three-minute dealing
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.600]   where the children walk to the front,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.160]   are we gonna have children's church
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.600]   and then they come back in maybe
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.420]   if they don't disappear when they're 13
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.360]   or what are we going to do?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.960]   And Noel and I, my wife, we teamed up.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.480]   We haven't done this quite like this since.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.040]   We teamed up 'cause we both felt
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.800]   unbelievably strongly about this
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.620]   and we staked our lives on it.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.960]   We teamed up and wrote a paper for our people
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.760]   arguing that we not have children's church
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.320]   and that we not have a mini children's sermon
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.600]   in the service, but that parents
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.440]   or other responsible adults,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.520]   if kids don't have Christian parents,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.880]   bring their children to the service
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.080]   after about four years old.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.840]   We provided a nursery 'til then
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.680]   and eventually those nurseries,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.360]   I put it in quotes, became very God-focused
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.080]   and nurturing times to help get little children
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.960]   oriented on God and ready to go
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.080]   with mom and dad to the big service.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.480]   That article that we wrote is
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.000]   is at the Desiring God website.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.880]   It's called The Family, Together in God's Presence.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.360]   And I'm gonna quote from it,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.520]   but I'm gonna leave off the very thing
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   everybody wants to know, namely how do you control kids?
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.440]   And that's the part my wife wrote.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.920]   And so if what I say here is at least provocative enough
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.120]   to get your interest, then go to the website
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.720]   and search for the article
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.760]   and read what my wife had to say about that.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.400]   But I think really the big issue is concepts of worship
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.320]   and concepts of parenting and concepts
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   of how things are transmitted to kids.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.080]   So let me just give a few thoughts from that article.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   God-centered worship is supremely important
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.600]   in family life and in the life of the church.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   We approached Sunday morning worship hour
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.880]   in my 33 years in the pastorate
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   with tremendous seriousness and earnestness and expectancy.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.920]   And don't hear those words as contrary to joy.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.560]   Think serious joy.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.440]   Think deep joy.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.200]   We were and are a happy people at Bethlehem.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.440]   We tried to banish, however,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   all that is flippant and trivial and chatty and chipper
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.200]   I just abominate chipper worship services.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.760]   Not all services had this flavor.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.880]   Sunday morning we called the Mount of Transfiguration,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.480]   meaning an awesome place of glory
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.720]   where you fall on your face almost speechless
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.760]   in the presence of God.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.280]   And Sunday evening or Wednesday evening
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.080]   or whenever you do whatever else you do
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.960]   is the Mount of Olives, which was the familiar spot
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.880]   where Jesus probably laid down,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.240]   put his hand on his elbow and talked things over
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   with his disciples.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.960]   That's utterly crucial in the church as well.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.600]   We didn't have a children's sermon
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.120]   as part of the Sunday morning service.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.160]   We believed that even though it might be fun for the kids
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.800]   in the long run, it would weaken the spiritual intensity
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.480]   of our worship.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.800]   To everything there is a season.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.920]   That's so crucial.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.120]   People think you gotta put everything
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.440]   in the Sunday morning service or take it out.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.880]   It seemed to us that for at least one hour,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.480]   one hour a week out of 168,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   we should sustain a maximum intensity of moving reverence.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.040]   I'm gonna say that again 'cause I really like that phrase.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   A sustained maximum intensity of moving reverence.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.560]   And our arguments for bringing children to worship,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.720]   of course, will only carry weight
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.960]   with parents who really love that,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.520]   who really love to meet God in worship
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.240]   and really want their kids to get that
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.800]   and grow up breathing that air.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.960]   The greatest stumbling block for children in worship
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   is parents who don't cherish doing that worship.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600]   They don't love it.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   Children can feel the difference between duty and delight.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.400]   They know if dad loves being here.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.880]   So the first and most important job of a parent
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.120]   is to fall in love with the worship of God.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.200]   Any sense of being there out of duty
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.000]   or being forced to or some other reason besides,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.280]   I love being here, kids know that.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.160]   And they'll hate it just like you do deep down.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.320]   You can't impart what you don't possess.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.800]   And this is what you want your children to catch.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.680]   You want them to catch authentic worship.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.800]   Authentic, heartfelt worship
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   is the most valuable thing in human experience.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.920]   Think of it, the cumulative effect
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   of 650 worship services spent with mom and dad
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.520]   in authentic communion with God and his people
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   between the ages of four and 17 is utterly incalculable.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.240]   The aim is that the children catch the passion
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.600]   for worshiping God by watching mom and dad
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.120]   enjoy God week after week.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.720]   What would be the impact if for 12 years
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.800]   the children saw dad with his face in his hands
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.360]   praying during the prelude to worship?
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.440]   What would be the impact if they saw mom
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.000]   and both of them beaming with joy
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.440]   and singing the praises of God?
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.480]   Just think of it, millions and millions of children
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.800]   never, never see their parents sing,
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.440]   let alone sing songs with joy to a great God.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.360]   Something really seems wrong to me
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.380]   when parents want to take their children
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.960]   in the most formative years
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   and put them with other children and other adults
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.080]   to shape their attitude and behavior in worship
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   rather than having them right there to shape them.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.440]   Why wouldn't parents be jealous
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.640]   to model for their children the tremendous value
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.080]   that they put on joyful reverence
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.240]   in the presence of Almighty God?
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.660]   Of course, it's over their head.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.780]   It's supposed to be over their head.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.300]   They're beginners.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.640]   The English language is over their head
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.460]   as soon as they come out of the womb.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.640]   But we don't say, well, let's put them with other children
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.580]   in their own situations and limitations
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.000]   so that they can understand a word or two.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   No, we immerse them in the English language every day
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.680]   that they don't understand 90% of
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.340]   in the hope and expectation
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.720]   that they grow up into joyful use of the English language.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.020]   Long before children understand fully
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.940]   what's going on in worship and what's sung and what's said,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.940]   they're absorbing tremendous amounts of what is valuable.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.420]   And this is true even if they say they're bored.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.540]   Music and words become familiar.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.620]   The message of the music starts to sink in.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.780]   The form of the service starts to feel natural.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.260]   Even if most of the sermon goes right over their heads,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.220]   experience has shown that children hear
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.020]   and remember remarkable things.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.460]   The content of the prayers and the songs and the sermon
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.860]   gives parents unparalleled opportunities
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.540]   to teach their children the great truths of the faith.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.700]   What an opportunity.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.820]   If parents would only learn to query their children
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.540]   after the service and then explain things to them,
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.420]   it would become enormously valuable
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.140]   for their long-term growth in the knowledge of God.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.260]   There is a sense of solemnity and awe
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.100]   which children should experience in the presence of God.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.100]   They should sense this is a sacred moment, a sacred place.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.140]   This is not likely to be happening in children's church.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.740]   And unfortunately, it's not likely to happen
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.540]   in many adult services that put a high premium
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.820]   on horizontal chatter, chatter, chatter,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.420]   rather than vertical joy.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.740]   The aim is to awaken them to the greatness
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.380]   and majesty of God,
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.980]   not just his tenderness and familiarity.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.540]   So those are some of the thoughts
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   of why it is so valuable to have children in worship.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.300]   There is so much more to be said,
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.620]   especially about the kind of parenting
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.660]   and discipline at home that make all of this possible.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.100]   But you can go to the article for that
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.300]   and see what Noelle and I wrote about discipline.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.940]   The bottom line is, heartfelt, passionate encounters
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.940]   with the living God in worship
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.540]   should be the greatest desire of a parent's heart.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.180]   And there's no better place or time to impart this
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.140]   than with mom and dad doing it together
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.220]   with the children in worship.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.780]   - That certainly is provocative.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.660]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.620]   And again, that article can be found at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.460]   It's titled "The Family Together,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.380]   Together in God's Presence."
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.020]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for listening.

[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.620]   Tomorrow, we feel the question
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.020]   about Pastor John's position on divorce and remarriage.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.540]   It's a very common question we get
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.700]   about second marriages.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.300]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.780]   I am your host, Tony Reinhke.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.940]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:55.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
