[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:20.240]   in Paul's epistle to the Philippians, in the third chapter, verses 7 and 8.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.720]   But what things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ; yea, doubtless, and
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.160]   I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.960]   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960]   Christ.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.720]   But, as you must have observed from the reading at the beginning, there is a sense in which
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.480]   if we are to understand the true message of this great chapter, we must look at it as
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:04.040]   a whole as well as in terms of certain individual and particular statements.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.960]   This is one of those chapters in which this apostle looks back across his life, makes
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.680]   a kind of general review of it, and records for us the extraordinary and remarkable change
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.200]   which had taken place in his life and in his experience.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.640]   I have pointed out on several Sunday evenings that this is something that he did not do
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.240]   habitually.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.520]   But now and again the apostle does it, and whenever he does it, he has always some special
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.840]   and peculiar reason for doing so.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.240]   And you notice that he came to do it this time because he had to deal with a situation
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.200]   that was arising in many of the churches and was threatening this church at Philippi.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.480]   Namely certain people were going round these early Christian communities and suggesting
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.960]   to them that unless they were circumcised and in a sense became Jews, their Christianity,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.720]   to put it at its lowest, was at any rate defective.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.360]   And indeed some of them would even teach that they were not Christians at all until they
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.160]   had thus placed themselves under the law.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   And it was in order to refute that that the apostle began this great statement, this remarkable
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.760]   autobiographical statement, in which he looks back across his life and tells us of this
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.200]   profound change that took place and which not only changed him, but changed of necessity
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.040]   his outlook upon everything.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.360]   Now we have been looking at this, a number of us, on a number of Sunday evenings, and
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.120]   we have been doing so for this good reason.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.240]   If the message of this book is true, and we are here, I take it because we do accept it
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.640]   in a way that much, well then the most important thing that happens to anybody in this life
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.920]   and in this world is to become a Christian.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.440]   That is certainly my sole reason for trying to preach this gospel.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.480]   It is because I believe that this is the most important and momentous thing that can ever
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.440]   happen to anybody.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.040]   The message of the Bible is to say this, that this is of this importance.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.640]   To be a Christian is not merely something that changes one's life and one's experience
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.280]   in this world.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.160]   It is not merely something that brings us happiness and peace and joy and various other
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.880]   benefits.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.080]   The fundamental reason for becoming a Christian, according to the scriptures, is that one's
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.160]   whole eternal future depends upon this thing.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.880]   Nothing less than that.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.840]   There are many institutions in the world and many teachings, many things which are being
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.720]   put to the consideration of mankind, which are meant to assuage their grief and to mitigate
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.800]   their sufferings and to solve their problems.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   But that is not really the primary object of the gospel.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.680]   The gospel comes to us and tells us that we are travelers through this world, but that
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.100]   this is not the only world, that we are all going on to another world, and that in that
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.760]   world and in that life we will go on living to all eternity without end.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   And that it is in this life and in this world that we determine that eternal destiny.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.640]   And that every one of us, therefore, is confronted by two dread possibilities.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.760]   Either we are going to an eternity of bliss and of happiness in the presence of God, or
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.680]   else we are going on to an eternity of unhappiness and misery and suffering.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.720]   Everywhere I say in this book, from beginning to end, that is the position confronting men.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:24.200]   And then it goes on to say that what determines which of those two fates is to be ours is
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.320]   whether or not we become Christian in this life and in this world.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:38.000]   It is our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ that settles our eternal destiny.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.160]   Now we are in this season of Advent.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.880]   We are moving on towards Christmas Day and the reminder of that great climactic event
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.480]   in the whole course of human history when the Son of God came out of eternity into time,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.760]   when the everlasting and eternal God was born as a babe and took unto him human nature.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:08.880]   And all that, says this book, was in order that men and women might be redeemed, that
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.760]   they might be rescued from a state of sin, that they might be saved from eternal punishment,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.720]   that they might be delivered from the wrath to come.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.560]   That is the statement of this book.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.640]   Now I say that any man who reads this New Testament, even takes it cursorily and superficially,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.440]   cannot fail to gather that impression.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.320]   Our blessed Lord himself said on so many occasions in different ways that he had come to seek
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.400]   and to save that which is lost.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.960]   He repeated the very message of John the Baptist who said, "Flee from the wrath to come."
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.760]   Our Lord himself emphasized that very thing, and these apostles whom he sent out, that
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   was their message.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.960]   So that I say there is nothing which is of such vital importance to us as that we should
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:09.160]   know for certain whether we are Christians or not, and for that tremendous reason that
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   the whole of our eternal destiny depends upon it and rests upon it.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.400]   And that is why I say we have been looking at the accounts which are given in various
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.440]   parts of the New Testament of the conversion of this man Saul of Tarsus who became the
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:33.240]   mighty apostle Paul, and especially at those passages in which he himself gives us an analysis
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.120]   of his own experience and tells us of something, of what this great event meant in his own
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.800]   life.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.120]   And we have been using that in this way.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   Regarding this question of conversion and of becoming Christian, as of this primary
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.600]   and central importance, we have suggested that the best thing we can ever do is to apply
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:07.720]   certain tests to ourselves in order to make certain that we really are Christians.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.600]   Now it may be upsetting to some, it may be somewhat disturbing.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.280]   People indeed have said that to me, that the questions have made them wonder as to whether
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.240]   they have ever been Christian or not.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.200]   Well, that is not my primary object, but if it has that effect, I can but say, "Thank
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   God!"
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.040]   I am grateful to any writer, to any speaker, to anyone whom I know or have ever met who
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.360]   has caused me to examine myself and search myself to make sure, as the apostle puts it,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.280]   whether I really am in the faith or not.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.640]   We all must have met in our experience men and women who seemed to be Christian at one
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.320]   time and who claim to be Christian, but who tonight are denouncing it all and renouncing
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.520]   it all and pouring ridicule and scorn upon what they once professed to believe in.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.740]   It is clear of them, as the apostle John says in his first epistle, that they were obviously
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.120]   not of us.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.520]   They thought they were, we thought they were perhaps, but they were not of us, says John,
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.480]   because if they were truly of us, they would still be with us.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.720]   But they have gone out from us, says John, and thereby they have demonstrated and given
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   proof that they were never really of us.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.080]   My dear friends, as so much depends upon this, I say let us thank God for having caused His
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.760]   servants to write these things, whereby we can discover certain tests which we can apply
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   to ourselves.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.820]   Now, we have been considering a number of them.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:50.120]   We found that this man of God was astonished at himself as the result of this change.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.240]   We have discovered that he knew what it was to tremble.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.040]   We have discovered that he surrendered his will and gave himself utterly to this Christ
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.360]   whom he met on the road to Damascus.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.880]   And then last Sunday evening we went on and looked at it in this way.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   The apostle says that as the result of this, as the result of his meeting of Christ and
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.080]   his realization as to who he was and why he had come, as a result of that, says Paul,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   I really virtually became a new creation, a new man.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.040]   And he put it, you remember, in that dramatic phrase.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.880]   He contrasts the past with the present in this way.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.480]   Paul says the difference between a man who is not a Christian and a Christian is the
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   difference between a man who is in darkness and ignorance and a man who is in the light
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   and who has knowledge.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.200]   Sin, not being a Christian, is to be in darkness, is to be in ignorance, not to be aware of
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.300]   certain things.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.200]   But then the light comes and one begins to learn certain things.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   Knowledge is given.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:02.880]   Yes, he says, and not only that, it is like passing from chaos to order, from a state
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:11.560]   of unutterable disorder into a state and condition in which there are ways in our lives and order
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.600]   and system and understanding.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:19.880]   Well, now we have been applying those tests to ourselves.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.880]   But here in this chapter that we are looking at tonight, the apostle seems to me to suggest
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.600]   some further tests.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.800]   And as I am going to show you, they are very simple tests and very practical tests.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.440]   But at the same time, they are very thoroughgoing tests.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:45.080]   And you notice again, the great thing that the apostle emphasizes is the greatness of
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.000]   the change which has taken place in him.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.200]   We can never repeat this too frequently.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:00.480]   The profoundest change that can ever take place in a human life is the change that is
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.800]   described, if you like, as conversion.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.200]   It is the change of ceasing to be a Christian to becoming a Christian.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.600]   Again think of the terms that are used, new creation, regeneration, rebirth.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.920]   Nothing less than those terms are adequate to describe it.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.360]   And obviously it must be a profound change for this reason.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.440]   This is something that is done to us by the very Spirit of God himself.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.780]   The change from non-Christian to Christian is not like a man changing from one political
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.880]   party to another.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   That is a change, of course.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.440]   Or a man may change his views on art or on literature or on painting or on music or on
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.840]   a thousand and one things.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.480]   There are many changes that we are aware of in life, but none of them is comparable to
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.440]   this change.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:59.880]   Because this is a change which is wrought in us by the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.520]   He implants a new principle into us.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.800]   We become partakers of the divine nature itself.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.380]   There are certain possibilities implanted within us which were not there before.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:19.640]   And obviously, therefore, because of the deep character, the profound character of the work,
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:26.440]   the change that must take place in anyone who is the subject of such an action must
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.880]   be the profoundest change conceivable.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.840]   And the Apostle tells us here, he uses this striking language, it is the difference between
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.240]   gain and loss.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:44.520]   It is the difference between something that he had regarded as very precious and refuse.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.040]   Now he could not use stronger language.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.140]   He could not paint two greater extremes.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.140]   And he does it quite deliberately in order to show us something of the character of this
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.560]   change which had taken place in him.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:07.320]   We cannot but be amazed at the honesty of this man, especially as we realize from his
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.200]   own description of himself that he was a somewhat proud man by nature, a man who was pleased
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.400]   with himself and his own achievements.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.860]   He nevertheless stands up, as it were, and says, "I was altogether wrong.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.320]   I was utterly mistaken.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.800]   I have been an indescribable fool.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.420]   Everything I valued I can see now to be nothing and worse than useless."
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.760]   He admits it all frankly.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   What an honesty!
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:41.960]   Yes, it is, I say, a very honest confession.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:49.080]   But the important thing for us is to realize in detail what he tells us about it.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:56.020]   Becoming a Christian, says the Apostle, simply changes everything.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.720]   It isn't merely that he has light and knowledge where he formerly was ignorant.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   It isn't merely that there is order where there was formerly chaos.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:10.520]   He tells us here that he has got an entirely new set of values.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   His way of looking at everything is absolutely different from what it was before.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.600]   He has got new standards, he has got new balances, new scales.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:29.160]   The way he estimates and analyzes and examines everything is absolutely different.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.280]   And because of that, the way in which he looks at everything and estimates everything becomes
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.240]   entirely different.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:42.820]   And now here he is, making a general review of life and telling us that now, as a Christian,
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.980]   his view of life is so different from what it used to be that it is almost something
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.400]   that baffles his own powers of description.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.520]   And it is that I want to put before you this evening.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:05.720]   A man, I say, is not a Christian unless he can say quite honestly that his whole view
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.320]   of life is absolutely different from what it was before.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.640]   Now mark what I am saying.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.680]   I am not saying that he adds something on to what he was before.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.640]   I am not saying that he puts in some kind of appendix in the book of life that he had
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   previously written.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.640]   I am not saying that.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.160]   I am saying that the book of life itself is different.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.960]   I am saying that it is essentially different.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.560]   Not that it is modified here and changed a little bit there.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.160]   I say that the whole thing is so different that these very categories of Paul alone are
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   sufficient.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   It is gain and loss.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.680]   It is value and refuge.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.000]   The whole thing is different.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.680]   The Christian's view of life this evening is entirely different.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:00.520]   I use my word advisedly from that of the non-Christian.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.000]   Now let me prove that contention.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.960]   How do you evaluate a man's view of life?
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.160]   What is life?
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.120]   I say that these two views of life are essentially different.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   But what is life?
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:25.280]   Well, a very convenient way of describing or analyzing life is this.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.960]   Life rarely consists of the past and the present and the future.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.320]   That is everybody's life.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.840]   That is the whole of life.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.920]   Life if you like is a kind of stream.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.720]   It has come from somewhere.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   It is moving.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.800]   It is going somewhere.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.400]   Past, present, future.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.800]   So that as you would compare and contrast the non-Christian and the Christian views
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.760]   of life, that is perhaps the most convenient way of doing so.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.000]   You look at them in terms of what they think of the past and of the present and of the
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   future.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.560]   And that is the very thing that the apostle does in the body of this chapter.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.280]   I wonder whether you would ever notice that.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.400]   He starts by telling us the change in his view of his past.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.600]   He tells us what his view is of his present and he tells us what his view is of the future.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.680]   And as you look at these descriptions which he gives of these viewpoints as a Christian
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:31.120]   man, you realize that he is contrasting it with everything that had been true of him
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   before.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.520]   Now let me show you the difference.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.920]   Take for instance the change that comes in a man's view of the past when he becomes
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.120]   a Christian.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.200]   It is very obvious in the case of this apostle, isn't it?
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.840]   This is how he used to view the past.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:58.160]   If any of the men thinketh that he hath whereof he might boast or trust in the flesh, I more
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:07.680]   listen, circumcise the eighth day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:16.360]   of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Pharisee concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.040]   the righteousness which is of the law, blameless.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.600]   Now there is a view of life.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.040]   And the apostle tells us that that used to be his view of life.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.520]   That was his view of himself in the past.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.360]   We need not stay with this this evening.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.520]   I think the lineaments are perfectly clearly drawn.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.680]   I think the elements are quite simple.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.160]   The apostle was tremendously proud of his birth and of his ancestry, proud of the fact
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.560]   that he was a Jew and of the particular tribe to which he belonged, proud of the fact that
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:02.240]   every detail and diota, as it were, of the law had been observed in his case at his birth.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.360]   There was nothing in that respect which he hadn't done, and he was tremendously proud
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   of it.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   He thought it was the greatest and the most wonderful thing that any man could ever have
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.280]   and ever boast of.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.800]   And then he goes on, you remember, to boast of his achievements in the keeping of the
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.560]   law and in various other respects.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.080]   He looked at himself and at his life in the past, and as he looked at these things, he
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.680]   felt a tremendous sense of self-satisfaction and of pleasure.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.200]   Those were the things which he regarded as great things and as valuable things, the priceless
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:45.440]   things, and he had them all, and he made his boast in them as he says.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   But you notice that now, after he has become a Christian, he looks back across them all,
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.960]   and this is what he says, "What things were gained to me, those I counted lost for Christ,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.080]   yea, doubtless, and I count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:07.000]   Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.360]   The whole thing in which he used to boast and of which he was so proud becomes now worthless.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.440]   His language is almost violent.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   It's refuse.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.120]   "It's a hindrance," he said, "the things that I so gloried in.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:29.880]   I despise, I'm ashamed of myself and of ever having paid such attention to them."
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.800]   That is what happened to this man's view of the past when he became a Christian.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.160]   His view of the past is absolutely and entirely changed.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.520]   It's revolutionized.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:46.680]   Now, the argument that I want to present to you is this, that if that was true in the
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:52.840]   case of this man, how much more so should it be true in the case of every one of us
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.840]   who becomes a Christian?
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.360]   Well, let's apply the test to ourselves.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.920]   Let's see where we stand.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.680]   What are the things that we prize and value?
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   What are the things that you and I live for?
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:19.200]   Well, there is no doubt about this, that when a man becomes a Christian like this man, Saul
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.000]   of Tarsus, he looks back across his life and at the things that he used to think were so
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.200]   wonderful, and he sees now that they're useless and they're utterly and absolutely
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.320]   worthless.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   There's not a case of conversion in the Scriptures of which that isn't true.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.760]   You can take up the biographies in the history of the church, the lives of all the saints,
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.320]   and you'll find that every one of them says exactly the same thing.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.520]   There is evolution in their ideas.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.960]   Their scale of values has become different.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:02.400]   Their whole way of estimating things has changed, and they make the same pronouncement exactly.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:11.000]   Now here was a man, let us observe and remind ourselves, who rarely had belonged to the
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.920]   children of Israel, to God's own people.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.600]   And that was a very remarkable thing.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.760]   They were God's own people.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.880]   He had indeed belonged to this tribe of Benjamin, which is again an excellent and a noble thing.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.360]   And he was religious, and he lived for religion, and he lived to worship God, and he had all
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.680]   the ceremonies performed in his life, and he boasts of them.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:41.320]   Well, there's a sense, I say, in which those are very excellent things.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:47.160]   But what is it that men and women glory in now?
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.840]   What are the things that really people prize and that they value, the things in which they
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.000]   delight and which they boast?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.800]   Well, if the apostle looking back when he'd become a Christian could speak of the things
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:09.360]   that he had prized as refuse, how much more so, I say, the average person who becomes
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.200]   a Christian.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.400]   What is it that men and women delight in?
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.120]   What are the things that the natural men prizes?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.640]   Well, they're very similar, are they not, to some of these things that Paul delighted
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640]   in?
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:30.560]   There are still people, you know, who delight in birth and ancestry, and in language and
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   in race and in nationality and things of that kind.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.200]   It's not for me to denounce these things, but I say that men and women put those in
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.400]   the supreme position.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:48.640]   They are the things that they hold on to and make their boast of.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.320]   There are people who think that the possession of material things is the greatest and the
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.000]   biggest and the most wonderful thing that can ever happen to a man in this world, and
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.400]   they literally worship.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.760]   Coming down the scale, there are people who live just for the round of pleasure and for
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.960]   entertainment and things of that description.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.480]   Well, I needn't keep you.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.640]   You're aware of the things that are valued in the world tonight?
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.880]   You just look at your newspapers, look at the society columns, so-called, look at the
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.200]   way that people are spending their evenings, the so-called great people, those are the
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.720]   things that they think are marvelous.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.840]   They'll pay great money to enter into such circles.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.680]   They'll give their last farthing in order to be considered as belonging to such circles.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.280]   They'll spend their money on food and drink and display and show these are the things
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.080]   they say are marvelous.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.120]   And the newspaper placards them and boasts of them.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.840]   It's a marvelous thing to belong to such a realm of life.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.880]   Those are the things that they value.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   But as certainly as we're in this building at this moment, the moment a man becomes a
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.680]   Christian, he changes his view utterly and entirely of such things.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   He must do so.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.160]   I'll tell you why.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.520]   He's got a new standard of values, I say.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.160]   The apostle obviously had.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.200]   Why does he now describe as refuse that which he formerly boasted in?
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   The answer is he's got a new way of looking at things.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.600]   He's got a new yardstick.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.760]   He's got a new measure.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.560]   He weighs things differently.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   What are the tests now?
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.000]   Well, here are the tests.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.960]   The first thing a Christian asks about anything is this.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.880]   What is the value of this to my soul?
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.720]   You see, before he hadn't realized that he'd got a soul.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.660]   If he'd believed it theoretically, he certainly didn't live on it.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:52.680]   And as he estimated and adjudged and evaluated things, it wasn't in terms of the soul.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.520]   He was adopting another standard.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.760]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, he says to himself, "The most important thing
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:06.920]   about me is this, that I have got that within me which has been given to me by God, which
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.540]   is bigger than this world and life itself.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.100]   It's going on when I die and my body shall be rotting in a grave.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.460]   It's this imperishable thing that I have as a man and as a being created by God.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.180]   And what I want to know is this.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:29.380]   What's the value of a thing to my soul?"
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:34.540]   And you look again at those selfsame things.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.540]   Does my nationality make any difference to my soul?
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.740]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:47.660]   One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.860]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.700]   The whole world is guilty before God.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.620]   There is no more Jew nor Gentile, barbarian, a Scythian, bond nor free.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.060]   No, no, why?
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.420]   Well, because all are sinners.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.260]   The moment I begin to think of my soul, I see that that thing which in and of itself
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.820]   may be certainly of value becomes valueless if I put it in the first position.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.820]   It's my soul that matters.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:20.700]   And my soul, though I am a so-called white man, is no different from the soul of a coloured
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   man.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:27.900]   Colour and skin and clime and continent and nationality are equally irrelevant to me now.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.140]   It's my soul that matters.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.460]   I've got a new way of estimating and judging things.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.660]   Another test which I have is this.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:50.060]   What is the value of this thing as regards my knowledge of God?
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:55.220]   Because you see, the moment a man becomes a Christian, he again realises that the greatest
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:01.620]   thing in life is to know God.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.540]   In the past, of course, he spent his time in trying to get to know this great person
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.780]   or that person.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.460]   He asked somebody, "Can't you arrange an introduction for me, this great notability?
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.220]   Oh, if I could only meet that person!"
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.860]   And they vie with one another.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.700]   And as I've been describing to you, there's nothing in a sense they won't do in order
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:23.780]   to have these introductions and enter into the most select circles.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.620]   All right.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:35.340]   I'm not here to denounce even those things as such, but I am here to say this, that when
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.300]   a man becomes a Christian, the one thing he wants to know is this, "How can I get to
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.780]   know God?
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:48.500]   Who will lead me to God and bring me to God and give me a deeper and a larger knowledge
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.500]   of God?"
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.160]   It's God I want.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:57.340]   And as I look back across my anxiety to know others in my old life, I'm ashamed of it.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.380]   It's refuse.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.900]   I put men in the position of God.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.780]   I put the knowledge of persons who will soon be dead and rotting in the grave, in their
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.420]   bodies themselves, where the Almighty and the Eternal should be.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:16.220]   I've got a new standard of values.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.660]   And then another thing, of course, that helps me is this.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:31.540]   I now begin to judge things in terms of sin and their effect upon my soul.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.580]   Having had my eyes opened to the character and the nature of sin and of its utter pollution
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:42.020]   and of its abomination and in view of the fact that I'm told that no man who is sinful
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:47.620]   can enter into the presence of God, what I want to know now about everything is its effect
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:54.220]   upon my soul in terms of sin.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:59.100]   And that is why you see the men who used to boast about his drink and his conviviality
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:06.460]   and being a good fellow and not being angular and difficult and so on, the moment he becomes
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:11.940]   a Christian he's horrified and amazed at himself, that which he thought was so marvelous
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.380]   and the thing to do.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.980]   He sees as now the thing that was debasing him and polluting him and drugging him and
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.260]   preventing his thinking about God and his soul and his eternal destiny.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.260]   He hates it.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:32.820]   It's refuse, it's done, it must be thrown out forever.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.460]   When a man becomes a true Christian there's no need to argue with him about these things,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:42.460]   he sees them as plain as daylight.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.620]   Everything has got to be judged, I say, in its effect upon his soul and his relationship
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:52.740]   to God and getting rid of this sin, this polluting, dirtying thing that is in the world and the
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.020]   world is so full of.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.300]   He hates it.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.340]   You see he's got a different way of judging.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:08.140]   Or perhaps I can put it still more clearly in a final word in this way.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:15.380]   He judges it in terms of eternity.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:23.180]   Whether we like it or not, my friends, the fact is that the Christian is primarily interested
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.260]   in eternity.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.580]   And what matters to the Christian now about anything is its lasting value, its power of
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.140]   persistence.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.060]   And you see the moment he begins to look at anything from that standpoint he looks back
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.980]   at the things that he used to think were so valuable and he sees that they're now absolutely
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.820]   useless.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:54.660]   As this man came to see it, you can't take your nationality with you beyond the grave.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:59.540]   You can't take your good works, you can't take your pleasure, you can't take your boon
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.980]   companions, you can't take any of these things.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:09.820]   Every one of them is already decaying, change and decay in all around I see.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:16.420]   The world and its kingdoms are passing away and man himself is passing away with it.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:21.620]   There is an element of disease and of death in all these things and they're disappearing
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.420]   even as we're enjoying them.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:29.420]   They don't last, they don't persist.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:34.340]   The Lord himself surely put that very clearly once and forever in his so-called parable
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.060]   of the rich fool.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   The man who had done so well that his very success had become an embarrassment to him
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:50.100]   and there he is congratulating his soul and saying, "So thou hast much goods laid up
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   for many years.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.500]   Eat, drink, take thine ease and be merry."
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.940]   And God said to him, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.420]   Whose then shall these things be?
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.020]   They must be left behind."
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.900]   And he goes on without them.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:14.020]   Oh, let me again summarize it in a very striking word uttered by the Apostle Paul in the sixth
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.220]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:24.660]   Asking these Roman Christians to look back, he puts this question, "What profit had
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:29.420]   he then in those things of which you are now ashamed?"
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.580]   "You're ashamed of them now," says Paul.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.460]   "What profit did you have in them even when you were doing them?
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.900]   There's no value in them, there's no fruit in them.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.460]   They don't lead to anything."
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.220]   My friend, take the non-Christian view of the world tonight.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.940]   Take the non-Christian life.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.260]   Take the thing that the papers are full of.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.260]   What's the fruit?
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.420]   What's the value?
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.460]   What's the benefit to the soul?
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.380]   What's the value from the standpoint of eternity and of God?
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.380]   It's a waste.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.380]   It's refuse.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:07.820]   The Christian's view of the past life is a completely different one.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.220]   There has been an entire reversal in his standard of values.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:18.140]   Let me hurry on to say a word about the present.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:23.980]   What is the present to the non-Christian?
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.740]   Well there can be no doubt about that.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:34.020]   The present to the non-Christian is nothing but a simple continuation of the past.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:44.300]   He is so ignorant, he is so bounded and enshrouded in darkness that he knows of nothing different.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:50.700]   And the result is of course that the life of the non-Christian, speaking generally,
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:57.420]   is always in some shape or form a life of boredom.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.100]   The difficulty, says the non-Christian, is to know how to pass the time away, what to
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.300]   do with oneself.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:09.660]   And there he is not knowing what to do with himself and having to depend entirely upon
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:15.340]   what may change to turn up or upon what the world may provide for his interest and for
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.540]   his entertainment.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.380]   Has that ever occurred to you, I wonder?
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.100]   Have you ever realized that?
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:32.140]   That the most tragic thing about the non-Christian view of life is that it's absolutely empty.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.940]   It has no resources in itself.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.780]   It has nothing on which it can depend.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.020]   It must be entertained, and that's why the world is living that kind of life.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.700]   The man of the world simply can't stand spending an evening with himself.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.540]   It's intolerable to him.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.540]   It's boredom.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:54.340]   It's intolerable to him because, I say, he doesn't know what to do with himself.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.340]   Time hangs.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.940]   How can it be made to pass away?
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.620]   What can he do to get out of it?
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:04.980]   And when suddenly he is bereft of these entertainments, he is indeed in a most pathetic and powerless
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:10.020]   condition.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:16.940]   It's a life, I say, which is entirely dependent upon surroundings and circumstances and that
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:22.100]   which the world provides for him.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:27.180]   But listen to the apostle describing what he has now found.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.660]   He says that he counts all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.300]   though it has meant to him the loss of all things.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.540]   He says, "This is my idea, that I may win Christ and be found in him, not having my
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.860]   known righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ."
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:50.220]   Then listen to this, "That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:56.980]   fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.500]   unto the resurrection from the dead."
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.300]   "What are you like in the present, Paul?"
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.420]   "Now this is answer.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.620]   I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:14.660]   which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:20.060]   mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.340]   What does it mean?
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:30.860]   Well, let me translate it into our own terms and language in this way.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:39.580]   It means that the present for the Christian is essentially a great and a glorious opportunity
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:48.020]   of enjoying the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:54.260]   I like to put this test to myself in this way.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.060]   Am I bored by life?
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.500]   Am I tired and cynical?
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.100]   Do I find that time passes slowly and tends to hang?
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.580]   And am I sorry that I haven't got enough money to enjoy pleasure night after night,
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.420]   or that I can't travel to the ends of the earth in order to have some dissipation and
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.420]   some entertainment?
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:21.820]   Am I sorry that I'm not a multi-multi-millionaire in order that I can always have what I feel
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.820]   like?
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:28.780]   Am I dependent upon the things I can buy and purchase or that are given to me by others?
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:38.500]   Well, if I am, to put it at its lowest, I'm a very poor Christian.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.580]   Because the present for the Christian is an opportunity to know him.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:50.460]   He's seen him, he's met him, he's come to know him.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.500]   And the one thing he wants is to know him better.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.780]   Yes, the pity in life, says the Christian, is that I can't spend the whole of my time
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.120]   in just getting to know him more and more.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.260]   The difficulty with the Christian is not how to pass his time away.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.500]   It's to make time to have enough time.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.460]   My dear friends, is that your experience?
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.700]   I say to the glory of God in this pulpit, it's my great problem.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:18.180]   Oh, that I have more time, that I could multiply the twenty-four hours.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.540]   I want to know him.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:24.860]   I want to spend more time with him.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:32.220]   I know enough about him to want to know him more and to know him better.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:38.260]   You see, the Christian's life in the present is a life that is controlled by the Lord Jesus
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.620]   Christ.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:48.020]   So he spends his time in seeking him.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.020]   How does he do that?
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.140]   Well, he reads this word.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.460]   If you want to find him, come to the word.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.620]   It's the word about him.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.180]   It is his word.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   And the Christian comes to it and he spends his time with it.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:03.980]   He reads it, he studies it, he meditates upon it, and thus he gets to know him through
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.300]   it.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:13.180]   And then he spends his time in prayer.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.420]   Now prayer means seeking him again, asking him and pleading with him to manifest himself
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.660]   and to make himself known.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.420]   If you're like a person, you want to be with that person and you talk to that person.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.600]   And the Christian loves Christ and he wants him and he seeks him in the word, in prayer,
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.020]   in fellowship with other Christians.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.440]   Boredom, it's unthinkable.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.340]   How to make the time pass, how to get through an evening, my dear friend?
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.340]   As I said, the trouble is there isn't enough time for these things.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:49.940]   There is work and business and affairs and one's duties.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:42:00.100]   But that's the Christian in the present, enjoying Christ, seeking him more, yes, and
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:08.020]   serving him increasingly, giving his energy and his time to the spread of his kingdom,
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:12.100]   telling others about him, always glorifying him.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.740]   I mustn't keep you.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.140]   But you see that the view of the non-Christian and the view of the Christian of the present
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:27.220]   are utterly and diametrically opposed.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.940]   Test yourself in this way, my friend.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:39.220]   Imagine suddenly that you found yourself on a sick bed and you were too weak and too feeble
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:45.180]   to read or even perhaps to listen to anybody else reading to you.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:50.820]   Certainly much too tired to think of dancing and gambling and drinking and even eating.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.300]   There you are, left there in your weak and of philosophy.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:00.100]   What would you do with yourself?
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:07.260]   A modern philosopher once said that the right definition of religion is this.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:14.860]   He said, "Religion is that which a man does with his own solitude."
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.980]   I think up to a point it's a very good definition.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.100]   What you do with your own solitude, what you do when you're alone and left to yourself
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.980]   and can't depend upon external agencies, what then?
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   Is he with you?
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.580]   Do you rest in him?
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.980]   Do you speak to him?
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.620]   Do you just smile at him?
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.500]   Do you just offer up a sigh of a prayer to him?
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.580]   Is he with you?
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.100]   Are you enjoying him?
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.340]   That's the test.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:45.980]   The Christian in the present is entirely different from the non-Christian.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:53.940]   Just a final word about the difference as regards the future.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:02.060]   And here perhaps the difference is even more striking and telling.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.180]   The old view, of course, can be summarized very briefly.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.220]   It's a dislike of the future altogether.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.780]   It's a dislike of considering it.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:19.020]   I mean not only the future in terms of an odd week or month or year perhaps, but the
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.940]   whole of a man's future.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:29.900]   Looking on right across your life to old age and to death, to your burial, to what lies
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   beyond it.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   That's the future.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.100]   The future doesn't stop with next week or next year.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:43.820]   The future goes on beyond life into eternity.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.940]   And the non-Christian doesn't like that.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.220]   He isn't interested in it.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   He regards it as morbid.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.060]   He hates us when we ask him to do so.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.340]   He's afraid of it and he's uncertain about it.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.020]   He doesn't know what's going to happen.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.340]   He doesn't know what's going to take place.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.380]   He doesn't know where he's going or what's going to happen to him.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.420]   He doesn't have anything to rely upon.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.260]   He has nothing to look forward to.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.260]   It's a blank.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:13.620]   It's darkness.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:18.900]   And death to the non-Christian is a terrible spectre.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:25.780]   It's an enemy, ugly and foul, hide your head, waiting to consume him and to spoil life.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:31.300]   And that is why the natural man when somebody dies says, "Poor so-and-so."
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.360]   You should never say that of a Christian.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.580]   But that is what we say.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.940]   He's become a victim.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.740]   He's gone down into that awful pit from which no one ever comes up again.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:49.100]   That's the non-Christian view of the future.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.940]   What is the Christian view of the future?
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.780]   Well, listen to Paul putting it in this chapter.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.860]   "Our conversation," he says, "is in heaven.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:13.500]   vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.940]   whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.700]   What's it mean?
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   Let me interpret it.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.940]   It's this.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:30.540]   The Christian says with this man, "We are a colony of heaven.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.500]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.060]   We are strangers here.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.180]   There is my home.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.780]   That's the country to which I belong.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.580]   That's the territory to which I'm going."
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:50.060]   The life of the Christian in this world is but a passing life.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:56.820]   Strangers and strangers, travelers and sojourners.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.940]   That's how the Christian looks at the future.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.980]   Yes, he says, "Time is passing.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.220]   I'm getting older day by day.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   Yes, I know.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.380]   It is life, but what is it?
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.820]   Well, it isn't a terrible thing to me.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.780]   I'm not a man who belongs to this life any longer.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.420]   I belong there.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.820]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.820]   We are but a colony.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.300]   There is the homeland.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.100]   There is the fatherland.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.660]   We are but a colony here.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.140]   We are but here for a while.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.940]   We are traveling through it."
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:39.140]   And not only that, we are looking for the coming of the Savior.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:47.660]   Yes, we are reminded these days of how he first came to Bethlehem.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:57.460]   This is the season of Advent, and we remember how once he came in a most unexpected manner.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:04.580]   But my dear friends, the Christian knows that he is coming again, and not as the babe of
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:11.940]   Bethlehem next time, but as the King of kings and the Lord of lords riding upon the clouds
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:22.300]   of heaven, surrounded by his holy angels, we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.980]   He is coming.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.460]   Whatever happens in the world, I'm not saying you shouldn't be interested.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.940]   You must take an interest in the atomic bomb, take an interest in the international situation.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:38.700]   It's our duty as citizens, yes, but beyond it.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.780]   Let us never forget that we have never placed our hope as Christians in this life and in
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.220]   this world.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:54.540]   We are looking for the Savior who is coming back to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.700]   Whether we like it or not, he is coming.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.700]   He said it.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.420]   The whole Bible says it.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.500]   We are working up to an end, and it will be an end of judgment.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.780]   And those who belong to him shall go to glory, and those who have rejected him shall go to
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.540]   perdition.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:20.700]   So that as we look to the future, we say to ourselves, "Yes, that third world war may
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.700]   come.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.940]   That terrible bomb may be used.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.180]   We may be blasted off the face of the earth.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.300]   Hell may be let loose, but it can't affect me.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.100]   It can't touch me."
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:41.460]   The Savior is coming, and all who belong to him shall be made like him.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.900]   Yes, and most wonderful of all, did you notice how he put it, "Even this body of mine shall
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.420]   be changed"?
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:55.740]   We look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, or if you
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:02.820]   like, the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:09.460]   according to the working whereby he is able to subdue even all things unto himself.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.380]   When he comes, that's one of the things he's going to do.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.460]   He's even going to take these bodies of ours and change them.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.540]   He's changed our souls already.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:27.140]   He's changed the outlook and the orientation.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:35.540]   But he's even going to change the body, and he will fashion it like unto his own glorious
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.340]   body.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.100]   We can't conceive of it, but it's going to happen.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.020]   That's the destiny of the Christian.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.260]   That's the thing the Christian looks forward to.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   That is certain.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.340]   That is absolutely sure.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:53.220]   He knows this is true, and therefore he views the future with calm and equanimity, with
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.980]   peace.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:06.660]   Because he knows that he and his eternal destiny are in the safe and the strong arms of the
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:16.300]   Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.540]   I ask a simple question.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.700]   Which is your view?
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.660]   What are you glorying?
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.940]   How do you estimate life?
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:39.460]   What are the things for you, the things which you value above everything and for which you'd
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.460]   give anything?
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:45.540]   What are they?
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.580]   How do you spend your time?
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:54.460]   How do you view the future?
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:52:03.980]   Answer those three questions honestly in the light of this chapter, and you will know exactly
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.860]   whether you are a Christian or whether you're not.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:16.420]   And as I said at the beginning, if you are not a Christian, this book has nothing to
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:25.220]   offer you, to say to you, except that you will go to an eternity in which you will spend
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:32.580]   all your time in trying to find satisfaction in things that can never satisfy.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.780]   That's hell.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:47.300]   God forbid that anybody listening to my words at this moment should go to such a fate.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:55.220]   My dear friend, look at these things in the light of Christ and see that the things the
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:00.860]   world lives for are refuse and dung and fruitless and waste.
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:09.260]   Turn to him and tell him so.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:15.300]   Acknowledge your folly as Paul did.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.300]   Give yourself to him.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.300]   Put your soul into his safekeeping.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:23.460]   And he will assure you that in spite of your folly and darkness and ignorance, he has loved
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:33.460]   you so much that he has even died for you, that God might forgive you for such sin.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:40.900]   And be reconciled unto you and receive you as his child.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:52.600]   And begin to prepare you for this amazing glory that awaits you and all others who believe
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.940]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.780]   Amen.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:01.700]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
