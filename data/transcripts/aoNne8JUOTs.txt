[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.320]   - Well, happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.940]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.960]   My name is Tony Reinke,
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.280]   and John Piper joins us today over the telephone.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.620]   You know, Pastor John, we get a steady stream of emails
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.080]   from listeners who ask about unanswered prayers,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.120]   like this one from a podcast listener named Luis.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.600]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.320]   In Philippians 419, I read this promise,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320]   that God will supply every need of mine
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640]   according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.560]   But I don't see God providing as his word says he would.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.200]   My prayers go up, but it seems like God is silent,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.560]   or he consistently answers me with an implied no.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.880]   This causes me to feel discouraged and ignored.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.080]   How do I respond to this no from God
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.760]   when I pray for good things?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   - I think few things have caused me to search my soul
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.040]   and search the scriptures more
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   than the fact that I have called upon the Lord to do things,
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.440]   which I think are in perfect accord with his will,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.600]   according to scripture,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600]   and yet he has not, or not yet, seen fit to grant,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.680]   or at least grant in the way that I asked or hoped for.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.960]   So I don't look upon the problem of unanswered prayer
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.240]   in a theoretical way, but in a very personal
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.000]   and sometimes gut-wrenching way.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.800]   I don't claim to have a final answer.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.680]   I hope someday to understand better
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.160]   and to have gone deeper with God in prayer
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.040]   so that I understand both from scripture and from experience
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.200]   how he deals with his children.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   But he has taught me some things,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   and it might be helpful if I give two Bible passages
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.040]   for you to think about and see whether or not
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.920]   they take you deeper than I've gone
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.820]   into the mind and heart of God
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.160]   with regard to the way he answers his children
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.560]   when they ask him for things.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.800]   Now, one of the texts is Matthew 7, 7-11,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   and this I saw years and years ago,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.040]   and so it's had a wonderful effect over the years.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.480]   The other one is a brand new insight from Genesis 17,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.400]   and it's right off my devotional front burner,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960]   so let me take these one at a time.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.440]   Here's what Jesus says in Matthew 7.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.840]   "Ask, and it will be given you.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.320]   "Seek, and you will find.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.380]   "Knock, and it will be opened to you.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.360]   "For everyone who asks receives,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.040]   "and the one who seeks finds.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.960]   "And to the one who knocks, it will be opened."
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.840]   And then he uses this analogy, which helps me so much.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.380]   "Or which of you, if his son asks him for bread,
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.640]   "would give him a stone?
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.100]   "Or if he asks for a fish, would give him a serpent?
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.280]   "If you who are evil know how to give good gifts
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   "to your children, how much more will your Father,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.760]   "who is in heaven, give good things to those who ask him?"
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.080]   That's an amazing analogy that draws us in
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.800]   to thinking about how we treat our children
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.240]   and how God treats his children.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.400]   And what's striking here is that God promises
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   to give good things to his children when they ask.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   And it's striking because it doesn't say
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.080]   he gives them precisely what they ask for.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   And since he's comparing himself to our own parenting,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.580]   we know that's the case.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.200]   We don't give our children,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.920]   especially when they're two or three years old,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.440]   everything they ask for because they don't know
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.640]   all that is good for them.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.800]   I remember once my son Benjamin asked me for a cracker
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   and I'm just totally eager to give him a cracker
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.080]   at snack time.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   And I reached for the box
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.600]   and I noticed they have mold on them.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.920]   And so I tell him I can't give him a cracker
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.560]   because it has fuzz on it.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.720]   And he says, "I'll eat the fuzz."
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.920]   (laughs)
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.780]   But I wouldn't give it to him because I knew better
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.340]   than he that mold was not good for him.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.060]   And so that day he got something that he didn't ask for
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.620]   and didn't want as much as he wanted a cracker,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.500]   but deep down would have wanted more
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.660]   if he knew what was good for him.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.820]   And I think the words of Jesus point in this direction
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.620]   for us when dealing with unanswered prayer.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.700]   Now, that may sound like a nice solution,
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.180]   but I know what some people are thinking,
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.420]   just like what I'm thinking,
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.960]   namely we ask glorious things of God,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.240]   like the conversion of our family.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.040]   And we can't imagine how it could be bad for us,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   how it could be moldy to have God save our family.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.840]   So I don't presume to say this is a quick fix.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.160]   And yet I do think the principle laid there
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.040]   should be embraced even if the application of it
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   to all situations is a little harder for us to grasp.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.140]   So that's the first help that God has given me
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.800]   in regard to how prayers are sometimes answered
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.840]   differently than we would ask.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.120]   And here's the other one.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.520]   And in a sense, this passage from Genesis 17,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   Genesis 17, 15 to 20 is an application in one way
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.920]   of what we've just seen in Matthew 7.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.120]   So here's the text.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   "And God said to Abraham, 'As for Sarai your wife,
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.160]   you shall not call her name Sarai,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.120]   but Sarah shall be her name.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.360]   I will bless her.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   And moreover, I will give you a son by her.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   I will bless her and she shall become nations.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.880]   Kings of people shall come from her.'
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.960]   And then Abraham fell on his face and laughed
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.600]   and said to himself, 'Shall a child be born
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.400]   to a man who's a hundred years old?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   And Sarah, shall Sarah who is 90 years old,
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.560]   bear a child?'
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.040]   And Abraham said to God," now this is a prayer,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.320]   "Abraham said to God, 'Oh, that Ishmael
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.600]   might live before you.'"
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.520]   In other words, God let Ishmael be the chosen seed.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   Verse 19, "And God said, 'No, but Sarah,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.360]   your wife shall bear you a son
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.400]   and you shall call his name Isaac.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.160]   And I will establish my covenant with him
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.600]   as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.'
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.600]   And then he says, 'As for Ishmael, I have heard you.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.720]   Behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.280]   and multiply him greatly.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.800]   He shall father 12 princes
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.960]   and I will make him into a great nation.'"
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   Now, Abraham had asked God in prayer
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.640]   that Ishmael would be the son of promise.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.000]   And God says explicitly, "No."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.600]   Now he might've just left it at that
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.760]   and gone on and done to Ishmael
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.520]   whatever he was gonna do to Ishmael.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.800]   But instead he takes pains to say,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.640]   "I have heard you, I heard you.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.040]   And that's what makes me do what I'm gonna do to Ishmael.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.760]   I have heard you.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.760]   That's why I'm going to bless Ishmael
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.080]   the way I'm going to bless him.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.640]   You have asked me to bless Ishmael
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.680]   and I'm not gonna do it the way you asked,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.080]   but I am gonna do it.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.800]   And I'm doing it because I heard you."
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.080]   Now, what should we learn from this
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   about God's no to our prayers?
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.880]   And here's the least I think we can learn.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.320]   Even when God says no
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.440]   to the specific intention of our prayer,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.280]   it does not mean there's no blessing
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.400]   in response to the prayer.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.200]   In fact, I would go so far as to say,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.640]   bringing in other texts, especially Matthew 7,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   when we pray with the right heart,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   we never, I mean never, pray in vain.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.960]   My colleague, Tom Steller, used to say,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.760]   and I loved it, still love it,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.520]   God never does nothing in answer to prayer.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.760]   So these two passages, Matthew 7, Genesis 17,
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.800]   along with numerous others,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   have kept me for 60 years crying out to God
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.520]   even when it seems that the specific thing
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.320]   I'm asking for is not granted.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   I really believe that God always gives good things
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.000]   to His children precisely because we ask Him
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.480]   and always because we ask Him.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.000]   The blessings we receive may not be in the form
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.320]   of the things we ask, but they are owing to our prayers.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.240]   They're owing to our prayers and they're good.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.800]   In fact, I think a day is coming,
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   according to Revelation 8, verses one to five,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.520]   when all the prayers that have ever been prayed
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.520]   by God's faithful people,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.720]   which have for thousands of years served
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.640]   as a kind of pleasing incense and aroma
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.760]   in the censer before the throne of God,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.640]   will be poured out on the earth
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.080]   in the consummation of history
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.560]   and bring about the consummation of history.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.360]   And it will be plain that not one expression
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.960]   of "Hallowed be thy name,"
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.400]   and not one expression of "Thy kingdom come,"
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.120]   or "Thy will be done on earth,"
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   not one of those prayers will have been prayed in vain.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.040]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.680]   That's such a profound truth.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   And we have a whole episode on this text in Revelation 8,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.560]   if you want more.

[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   from about three years ago.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.520]   But Tony, you ask, "How can I find episode 630
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.440]   "from such a long time ago?"
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.320]   I'm glad you asked.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.960]   Go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.280]   our listeners are given to the sin of sulking
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.440]   when they don't get their own way.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.040]   And if that's one of your struggles, you join many others.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.400]   And next time, we're gonna talk about
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.440]   the fight against moping
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.800]   and how to make war on this urge to sulk.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.920]   We'll hear Pastor John share
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.040]   from his own lifelong struggles here.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.280]   That's next time on Monday when we return.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.480]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.640]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you then.
