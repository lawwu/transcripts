[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   The big thing with like being able to run things at scale, there's actually
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.760]   a very big breakthrough that people either make or they don't make.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.640]   And the very big breakthrough is whether they know how to manage managers.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.460]   As I started out as an individual contributor, I get trained on how to be
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.140]   a manager of individual contributors.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.980]   That makes me an engineering manager.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.640]   And then if I get promoted to what they call engineering director,
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.860]   which is one level up, now I'm a director and now I'm managing a team of managers.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.860]   Anybody who can make that jump now has a generalizable skill of
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.980]   being able to manage managers.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.900]   And then what makes that skill so great is that skill can scale, right?
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.160]   If you keep climbing that ladder, at some point you get promoted to CEO and
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.740]   then you have a team of managers who are the executives of the company, and
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.900]   then everything fans out from there.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.220]   And so if you can manage managers, like at least in theory, you have the basic
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.100]   skill and temperament required to be able to scale all the way up.
