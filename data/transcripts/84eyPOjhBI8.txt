[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Some of the best teams, in my opinion, are the ones that are built by user-invaded. A lot of
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.720]   what you did, for example, with Weights & Biases, frankly, you yourself were a user in building
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.640]   Weights & Biases. I'm trying to think how many years ago that was when you demoed to Sumith and
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.000]   I. We looked at each other after the meeting and were like, "Holy ****, this is cool. This is going
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.560]   to be awesome." I didn't know that landed. That's so sweet. Okay.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.080]   You did. No, it was awesome. We both looked at each other like, "This is awesome. This is such
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.240]   a cool platform." It felt like it was built by someone who had a lot of user empathy.
