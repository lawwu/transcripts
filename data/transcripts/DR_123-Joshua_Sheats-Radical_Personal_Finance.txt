[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.080]   financial planner? Why would a successful CFP quit his job to start a podcast? And what do the
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   initials CFP, CLU, CHFC, CASL, CAP, RHY, and good grief, REBC mean after a person's name?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.720]   We'll answer these questions and more on this the 123rd episode of the Doughroller Podcast.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   Welcome to the Doughroller Podcast, where the best thing money can buy is financial freedom.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.920]   We help you make more, spend less, and invest the rest. And now your host, Rob Berger. Whether
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.640]   you're just starting out buried under a mountain of debt or well on your way to financial freedom,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.680]   this is the podcast to help you take your finances to the next level. Hey everybody, hope you're
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.160]   having a great day. Today on the show we have a friend of mine who I recently met at a conference,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.360]   his name is Joshua Sheets, and after speaking with him for even just a couple of minutes,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.240]   I knew I wanted to have him on the show. He is, among other things, you heard all those initials
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560]   in that last question, we'll try to figure those out in the interview, but he is a certified
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.560]   financial planner. And what makes him interesting, among other things, is that after having a
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.680]   successful career as a CFP, spending a number of years in that business, as you'll hear, he quit
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.520]   and he started a podcast. The podcast is called Radical Personal Finance, you'll hear more about
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.360]   it. And so I just thought it would be a great opportunity to hear what it's like to be a
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.080]   certified financial planner. What do they really do? How do they help people? What's that business
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.720]   like? Why did he quit? How's the podcast? And what are all those initials after his name? I kid you
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.200]   not, when you look at his about page and he signs his name at the end, there's just a string of
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   initials. I just have JD after my name, I mean, I'm happy with that one, but this guy's got a ton
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.440]   of credentials. And so we're going to hear from Joshua in just a minute and hopefully enjoy the
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.240]   podcast. I think this interview does win the award for the longest interview on this show, I believe
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.880]   so. So pretty detailed interview. Real quick before we get to that, I just wanted to mention,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.680]   I've got a number of shows planned in the near future that I hope you'll enjoy. Many of them are
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.240]   again, as I've mentioned in the past, topics that you have suggested or that I've mentioned. I have
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.160]   this long and growing list and every now and again, someone will email me and remind me, "Hey,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.520]   remember you promised to do a show about this." And so I haven't forgotten, but we're going to be
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.240]   talking about things like real estate investing and the taxes, the tax implications for investing
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.560]   in real estate. That's one thing that I had mentioned, that's coming up in just a few shows.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.440]   I'm going to cover and compare the different robo advisors out there. I really don't like that term,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   but I use it because that's just what they've come to be known as. You think of Betterment,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.600]   and I don't even consider personal capital a robo advisor, but it kind of gets lumped in there,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.720]   and Wealthfront and Future Advisors and other others. I've mentioned Acorn, it's kind of
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.000]   similar. How do you make sense of all this? Do they all do the same thing or are there differences?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   And what are the fees? Are there differences in the investment philosophies of these different
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.960]   investing tools, which is really what they are? So I'm going to cover that.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.360]   So I have a lot of good things coming up. Really, the point was, feel free to remind me
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.640]   that I promised a topic that you haven't heard yet. I love the reminders, but I haven't forgotten
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.920]   the list. I mean, literally, the list is probably 50 shows long. So it just takes me time, and it
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.800]   grows every week. I get email, and I think, "Oh, that's a great topic. Yes, I should record a
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.480]   podcast about that." I add it to the list. So please keep those emails coming in, drdorilder.net.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.360]   But I haven't forgotten. Feel free to remind me, but I haven't forgotten. It's just a long list,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:25.280]   and we're getting to them as quickly as we can. So with that, let's welcome Joshua to the show.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.240]   Joshua, welcome to the show.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   Rob, thank you for having me.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   Hey, so we met at FinCon for the first time and had some very interesting conversations
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   about financial planning, about your podcast, which we'll get to. And so I'm grateful for
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.120]   you taking the time to come on the show. And so for those listening, why don't we just start off?
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.440]   Why don't you tell us who you are and what you do?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.160]   Well, I've always been a personal finance junkie, which is probably the most,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.400]   I guess, germane information to start with. I've always been a junkie. I was the nerd when at 13
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.640]   years old, I should have been out playing football. I was reading books on investing
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.440]   and personal finance and securities analysis and all of that. But I always was very much
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.000]   involved in the personal finance side of it and always enjoyed running my own stuff. I like to
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.520]   tell my 18th birthday, I vividly remember sitting at my parents' dining room table and opening my
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.560]   first Roth IRA and opening my first credit card. I was very much kind of trying to be on the ball
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.720]   with all of my financial.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   Man, you are a money geek.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.120]   I'm telling you, I was a total nerd.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.400]   So where did you open up? At 18, where did you open up your Roth IRA?
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.920]   USAA, actually. They were offering a deal at the time. I started banking with USAA when I was in
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.640]   my early teens, mid-teens. And they were offering a deal on one of their funds that had a low
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   minimum purchase of like 25 bucks. And so I opened it up with like 25 bucks a month, auto-debited
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   right into their mutual fund. Kept that account for years.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.760]   How does someone in their teens get so interested in this? I mean, did your parents sort of guide
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   you into this or did you do this on your own? How does that happen?
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   My parents are not... They do fine, but they're not really connected to all the details of it.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   I just read a lot and I was educated at Holmes for the first half of my educational career.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.800]   So with that, you get the opportunity to read a lot. And so I read about everything I could
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   possibly find and I just found that personal finance books made it click to me because I
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.600]   wanted to be rich. And it seemed so simple if I just did A, B, C, D, E, all the charts in the
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.720]   book say, "Joshua, you'll wind up rich." And so I just found that I really enjoyed learning about
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.640]   it and I was good at it. So I was that annoying kid who was telling people what to do with their
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.560]   money when they really had no business doing so. Okay. So you started into this in your teens.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.640]   You opened up your first Roth IRA at 18, made a contribution. So you got that five-year rule
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.800]   starting to tick away. So you're past that, I'm sure, by now. So then what happened?
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.040]   And then I started building my credit score and then I started putting my way through college.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.840]   And I had purchased a book on how to build your credit score and my philosophy, and I'll tell you
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.120]   how crazy it went. My philosophy was that I wanted to invest in real estate at the time. That was
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.640]   what I saw as my path to riches. And so my plan was to build my credit score so I could easily
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.320]   access credit for the purpose of buying real estate. So systematically through college, I
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.600]   systematically raised the limits on my credit cards to the point when I was a junior in college,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.240]   this would have been 2006, junior in college, I had $100,000 of credit line available to me on
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   four credit cards. Now, can I just stop? I just got to stop right there for a second. Isn't it
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.400]   absurd that a junior in college can get 100 grand in credit? A junior in college earning just a few
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.120]   thousand bucks a year. I mean, honestly, that is just insane. Of course, this was 2006, you said?
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.040]   Right. You probably couldn't, you wouldn't have been able to do that in 2009, I'm going to guess.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.600]   Right. It's very different now. But I was very systematic about it. I just had a particular
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   file and every three months I'd call each of the cards and I'd request a credit increase and they
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   give me a credit increase and I've never been late on a payment of any kind for any reason.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   And so systematically, they kept expanding it. Now I shudder in horror at how stupid I could
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.560]   have been. But I wanted to be able to buy a house on a credit card if I needed to.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.400]   But sure, of course, why not a house on a credit card? Think of the reward points you'd get.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.840]   Think of how rich, after all, I was reading all these "Get Rich Quick with Money" real estate
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.080]   books and they were telling me how rich I could be.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.720]   I'm curious, what book did you read to understand credit scores, if you remember?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.680]   I don't remember. It was something I bought online. It was one of these PDF things.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.360]   So I got sucked in, when I was a teenager, I got sucked into the world of real estate investing,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.480]   the no money down world. And attended a couple of seminars and found a lot of information. And
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.360]   the key thing they always said was, "Build your credit score." That was what the scammers and
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.680]   the shysters at that time were focusing on. So I just said, "Okay, I'll build my credit score."
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.200]   So it was just some book. I printed it off the internet and followed it.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.880]   Did you ever invest in real estate?
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.120]   I didn't. I didn't. The first piece of real estate that I ever bought was the house that my wife and
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.800]   I now live in and that was two and a half years ago. And I'm so thankful I didn't. It was a
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.920]   miracle that I didn't wind up going bankrupt. I had several friends of mine from college
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.640]   who did get heavily into real estate investing here in Florida. But in the stupid way, before
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.440]   the crash, and lost everything, went bankrupt, a couple of them have recovered, a couple of them
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.880]   haven't. But I started going to the seminars, you know, the free hotel seminars. And you go for the
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.480]   one hour thing and then you go to the three day thing. And at the three day thing, I vividly
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.680]   remember when I was in college, I don't remember which year, but I think it may have been my
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.560]   sophomore year, I'm not sure. I came home from a three day real estate seminar with a buddy of
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.040]   mine. And I was all fired up and ready to put down the $20,000 for the private mentoring
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   program with the real estate guru. And I'm ready to do it. And my dad just basically said,
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.920]   Joshua, stop, don't be stupid, do not do it. And thankfully, I listened to him. And that decision
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.080]   saved me because I was a pretty aggressive guy. I was a pretty hardcore. I would have gone out and
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.840]   bought five properties just following the Get Rich in Real Estate books and without any actual
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.560]   foundation before it. And I would have been destroyed in the resulting correction because
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.120]   I wouldn't have known what I was doing. Well, good for your father. I have thanked him many
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.520]   times for that. And I'm also thankful that he put a respect for parents into me at a young age that
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.720]   I listened to him. The older I get, the smarter my dad gets. It's kind of crazy. I hope the same
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.840]   thing applies to my kids. We'll see. Okay. So you didn't go into real estate. What did you do after
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.320]   college? So after college, when I started college, I studied business and I thought I was going to be
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.160]   kind of the big corporate Fortune 500 CEO. I liked business. So my degree is in international
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.640]   business. And after college, I went and I worked at a marketing and brand management consulting
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.720]   company. And this was kind of the fancy after college job that I could make sound impressive
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.560]   to anybody if I tried. And I had a little bit of travel and working on all these big accounts with
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.960]   big Fortune 500 companies as kind of a junior analyst and making pretty decent money. But then
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   I got laid off. And thankfully, I had at the time, I had been following Dave Ramsey's baby steps as
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.680]   kind of my plan. My brother gave me a copy of Total Money Makeover when I was in college. And
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.400]   I thought it was very interesting. And I read it once and didn't make any sense to me. And then I
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.920]   read it again. I was like, "Wow, this guy actually makes sense." And I read it the third time and
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.280]   decided to get out of debt. So I worked like a maniac my senior year in college and paid off.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.120]   I paid off some credit card debt that I'd accrued because I'd put my way. I paid my way through
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.640]   college at a private university here in West Palm Beach. And so I was able to pay off some credit
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.440]   card debt and then pay for my senior year. And then actually two weeks before I graduated,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.200]   due primarily to the influence of Dave Ramsey and his get out of debt message, two weeks before I
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.600]   graduated, I wrote a check to Sally Mae and paid off all my student loans and graduated from college
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.440]   debt free. Wow. Good for you. It was awesome. I worked hard. I tell you. I vividly remember it
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.800]   because I worked harder that year than I'd ever worked. I took 19 hours of senior business classes.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.640]   I worked 40 hours a week. And I actually learned more that year than I had learned in any of the
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.600]   previous years, including a year where I didn't work at all during school. And I just put all my
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   school bills on student loans. And my teachers were far smarter than they were in any of the
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.720]   other years. And I got better grades. I actually got straight A's my senior year. And I had not
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.280]   gotten straight A's in my undergraduate years when I had more time to study. And I learned the power
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.840]   of focus and the power of time budgeting from that experience fundamentally shaped a lot of,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:40.720]   but it shaped me and who I am. Well, that's good. Okay. So you got, but you got laid off your first
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.600]   job. Right. So I, I worked for a year at this marketing company and thankfully I was, I was,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.400]   well, I didn't like it and I just hated the corporate world. And I want, I wanted to have
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.280]   the ability for, what's the word that means when a geometric growth, I wanted, I didn't want to be,
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.400]   you know, just a step by step growth. I wanted to have the opportunity to have compound growth,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.480]   real massive geometric growth in my income and in my business. But I got laid off. Now I got laid
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   off about six months before I was planning to leave. This was in 2008. I graduated from college
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.400]   in 2007. And in January of 2009, I had planned to leave the company I was with and go do something
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:25.360]   else. And I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. But in June of 2008, I was laid off. And on looking
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.680]   back on at this point, I'm so thankful that I was because I'm not sure I would have had the courage
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.600]   to actually leave in January of 2009 when quote unquote the world was falling apart. And so,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.840]   so I look back on that now and I'm thankful for it. But it was a total surprise to me. I thought
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.000]   that people got laid off just because they were bad workers and they, you know, were slackers.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.320]   I had just gotten an 8% pay raise at my job. I was, I was highly commended and they just,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.400]   the company eliminated my job position. And thankfully I, I had, was out of debt. I had
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.240]   a six month emergency fund. I had, you know, savings. So I was, I was in pretty good shape.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.360]   And a couple weeks after I got laid off, I was talking with, I was friends with my bosses and
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   the CEO of the company and all that. And we were having lunch and he said, "I'll help you in any
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.400]   way I can." So we were having lunch a couple weeks after I got laid off and I laid out for him
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.880]   the five things that I was looking for in a business. And I knew what they were, but I
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.720]   didn't know how to do them. And he said, "You ought to go look at financial services. That it
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.680]   might be a good fit for you." And I said, "No, I don't want to go into financial services.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.040]   Brokers are out to make you broker. Insurance is a scam and a waste of money. I can do better on my
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.760]   own. Like I don't want to go into financial services." And he said, "You ought to at least
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.200]   consider it because everything you just described sounds like financial services." And his son had
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.320]   interned with a company called Northwestern Mutual. They have a large college internship
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.760]   program and his son had had a good experience. I don't think he'd, he had not continued with
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.520]   the company after the internship, but he had a good experience. And so he had a contact there
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:59.040]   and he sent me to his contact there for an interview. And I went in and I was really
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.480]   impressed with the person that I interviewed with. And basically based upon that, it kind of opened
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.360]   my eyes to the financial services business, which I had never considered. And then I went around the
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.920]   industry, kind of interviewed at a few different places, did a bunch of research. And then some,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.600]   I don't know, a month or two later, I wound up after a bunch of interviews joining Northwestern
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.680]   Mutual in the fall of 2008. And I worked with Northwestern Mutual from the fall of 2008 until
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:30.960]   June of 2014. Okay. And that's when you quit there and started a podcast. Exactly right.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.360]   Which we'll talk all about that decision. So when you joined Northwestern, was it as a financial
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.880]   planner? Well, that's a, that's a, that's a, let's go, so let's get into some industry terms. I think
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.200]   I know from our conversations you can handle that. The term financial planner. We'll see.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.400]   (laughs)
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.440]   From the term financial planner and the term financial advisor is a very nebulous term.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:16:01.040]   It doesn't actually mean anything. So a financial planner is simply one who plans their finances.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.280]   And a financial advisor is simply one who advises from, on the perspective of finances. And in
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   financial services, there are many terms that people use and they probably shouldn't. There's
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.160]   a long history of all these words in the industry and many people are upset about it. So yes,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.480]   I was working as a financial planner. I was not a certified financial planner, which is most,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.400]   what most people are thinking about in the same way that they call an accountant, a CPA. A CPA
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.480]   is not an, you know, a CPA actually means certified public accountant, but that's a licensing
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   agreement. You can be an accountant and not be a CPA. And so I was a financial planner,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.240]   but I was not at that time yet a certified financial planner, a CFP designee.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.080]   Well, that's a good point. Cause I'm looking at your LinkedIn profile and I'll just read it for
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:54.480]   everyone. Joshua sheets, CFP, CLU, CHFC, CASL, CAP, REBC. So what exactly are you?
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.320]   It's even worse than that. There's a couple that don't fit.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.560]   If you can't fit them all, well, maybe we can, we can, we'll email Mr. LinkedIn and see if he can
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.840]   expand the name field. It's a little bit obnoxious. There's actually, there's an RHU and an MSFS as
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.040]   well that I just, I've just finished. It's a little obnoxious. All that stuff means is each of those
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:22.320]   is a unique specific industry designation and they, each of them has a meaning and, but the meaning
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.920]   is different. And unless you're actually in the financial services business, it's pretty hard to
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.480]   actually understand what all these designations are. And if you're interested, I can go through
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.400]   them and kind of explain what they are, but the more general question that you're, that you're
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.800]   asking, let me answer that first. All of those things just simply mean I've spent a lot of time
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.880]   studying and taking tests. That's basically what it means. It's hard for an outside person to know,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.480]   just because somebody has a bunch of letters after their name doesn't mean they've actually
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.080]   taken any hard tests. In our business, we are famous for, you can go and there are some
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.680]   designations that basically eight hours in a hotel conference room and a 20 minute, 20, 20
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.320]   question test and you can get some letters after your name. So you kind of have to do some due
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.080]   diligence to understand which designations matter, which ones actually signify a lot of work.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.360]   And I'd be happy to, to, to tell if you'd like, maybe it'd be valuable if I actually give you
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   the ones that, that actually mean are the most meaningful. Would that be helpful? Sure. Why not?
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.480]   Okay. So in the financial, in the financial advisory business, the two most prominent
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:33.680]   designations will be a CFP designation, which CFP stands for Certified Financial Planner,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:40.720]   and a CFA designation, which stands for Chartered Financial Analyst. And they're kind of different.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.920]   The Chartered Financial Analyst, in my opinion, is probably one of the most difficult exams.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.800]   There are three exams that you have to pass for that one and it is extremely technical,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.280]   it's extremely intense, and it's very appropriate for people who are involved in the day-to-day
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.440]   management of portfolios. It's very, very theoretical though, and it's very much about
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:06.960]   portfolio management and investment management. The CFP is, they bill themselves as the most,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.200]   the highest, I don't know what their, what their, their lingo is, but they bill themselves as kind
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.160]   of the highest financial planning standard or, or something like that. What that one is, is you have
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.000]   to take six, I think it's six or eight classes, something like that, and then you have to pass
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.200]   a comprehensive exam, which when I did it was a two-day, 10-hour exam. And that covers all aspects
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.280]   of financial planning. And so financial planning and portfolio management are two very different
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.960]   disciplines. So those are the two common ones. Some of the, then the other ones that are very
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:43.600]   common would be CHFC. So CHFC stands for Chartered Financial Consultant. That is a
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.680]   designation that's awarded by the American College in, of Financial Services up in Pennsylvania.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.920]   That one is a financial planning designation as well. A few more classes in the CFP, but it doesn't
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.240]   have a comprehensive exam. It's a little more in-depth in some areas than the CFP. And then
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:09.040]   there's also a CLU. And CLU is the, probably the initial, it's a very old designation, primarily
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.080]   focused on the insurance business. So it stands for Chartered Life Underwriter. And so somebody
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   who has that has done some detailed education on the topics of insurance. There are dozens more,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.640]   but that's probably the main ones that people could, would benefit from.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.680]   - What's interesting to me and something that I've learned more recently is that,
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.240]   as you pointed out, you don't have to be a CFP to be a financial planner.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.120]   - Right.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   - And for that matter, you don't have to be a CFA to manage someone's portfolio.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.680]   - Right.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.920]   - And on that score, it's as simple as taking the Series 65 exam and then getting,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:48.800]   putting the paperwork together to get licensed. And voila, you can manage $100 million in assets
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.840]   if you can get the clients. And the truth of the matter is I just took the Series 65.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:59.760]   And I suppose if you have no background, it would be a challenging exam. But the truth is,
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.160]   it's not that difficult. And it surprised me how easy it is to be licensed to manage
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.320]   someone else's investments. Anyway, I don't know.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.160]   - No, I agree. It's really not that tough. And so, you know, when you start a new financial
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.000]   advisor, well, generally, if you were a newly minted financial advisor and you join a large
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.400]   firm, then you need to, to be able to sell any kind of securities of any kind, you need either
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.560]   a Series 6 or a Series 7. And then also usually a Series 63 or a Series, let's just stick with
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:43.200]   a Series 63. To be a registered investment advisor, you need a Series 65, and the, which
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:51.040]   is what you've just done. And I took the 6, 63, and 65. So I did those three industry examinations
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   as well. But it's very difficult for an outside person to actually penetrate and understand what
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.480]   these things are. And it, no, and it doesn't take that much, yeah, it doesn't take that much
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:10.080]   actual, becoming a financial advisor, it doesn't take much. Now, being a good financial advisor is
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.200]   a very different proposition, but it doesn't take much to be able to print a business card that
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.480]   says financial advisor on it. - And that's kind of what I want to touch on. So that folks that
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.160]   are listening that, you know, maybe be, are thinking about hiring a financial planner,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:29.520]   you know, because it's not that hard to become one, then the challenge for consumers is kind of,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.080]   you alluded to, is figuring out how you find a good one. And so maybe we could start, since you
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.240]   worked as a financial planner, you know, at Northwestern for a number of years, you know,
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.040]   behind the scenes, what goes on, the stuff that your clients don't see, you know, you get a new
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.880]   client that you come in, that you meet with them, whatever, but what's going on? What are financial
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.160]   planners doing behind the scenes to, you know, advise their clients? What's, how does it work?
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:02.080]   - Depends hugely on the firm. And one of the biggest challenges with even a conversation
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.640]   like this, and I'll do my best to give you specific details on the answers to your questions,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.160]   but one of the biggest challenges to a conversation like this is that the accuracy of the answer is
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.760]   going to depend on the education of the listener. And so if you are, if you are well educated on
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:27.120]   financial topics and you are, you have a high degree of, you have a high financial IQ, you're
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   highly financially literate, then the answers will make sense. But if you're not familiar with some
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.840]   of the terms, it's really hard to be able to figure out what makes a good advisor, what makes
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.160]   a non-good advisor. There is a dramatic need for specialization in the financial planning business.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.400]   So a good financial planner, you can't be good to all people in all places. So you're going to have
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.880]   some area that you specialize in. And that specialization may be something like the
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.560]   difference between specializing in financial planning or specializing in portfolio management
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:07.840]   as an investment manager. So that would be one scenario. And this is my opinion. Some advisors
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.880]   would disagree with me vehemently, but I have always more enjoyed working as a financial planner
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.120]   rather than as an investment manager or a portfolio manager. And the reason is because
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.960]   the job descriptions are very different. As a financial planner, the primary job that you are
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.560]   doing with a client is helping the client to understand and clarify specifically and clearly
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:37.200]   what their financial goals are, analyzing where they are and figuring out what path is going to
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.920]   help them achieve the goals. That's in essence what a financial planner does. And so a financial
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.680]   planner is going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going to work for the client.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.320]   And that may come on a basic level of cash flow management, budgeting, something like that.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.200]   It may come from a product perspective, applying appropriate insurances, making sure that certain
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.520]   life insurance is taken care of, making sure that disability income insurance is taken care of,
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.880]   doing a review of somebody's property and casualty insurance coverage to make sure that that's
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.920]   adequate. It may be some on a portfolio perspective to make sure that the investments that somebody
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.000]   has is appropriate, making sure the tax strategy is on track. That's different than an investment
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.360]   manager or portfolio manager. In that person's job, they're tasked with guiding the performance
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.920]   of the portfolio. The problem is the financial planning occupation requires a lot of time with
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.800]   clients and not a lot of time spent at a computer looking at the ticker for whatever stocks you're
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.320]   tracking. The portfolio manager needs to not be with clients, needs to be in an office where they
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.480]   are able to actually spend time looking at and managing the portfolio. So that's one of the
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.800]   primary distinctions I think you'll see in most firms that's fairly well recognized, that it's
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.360]   difficult to do both things. You'll usually have a team approach depending on how the firm is
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.720]   structured. You'll have a team approach where you have a portfolio manager and a financial planner
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   working together and they have a different duties. But frankly, a lot of it is going to depend on the
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.200]   firm. And then it also depends on the compensation of the structure. That's where you get into these
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:16.400]   very confusing words like fee only, fee based, commission and fee, commission based, sales based,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.920]   all of these types of words that are very confusing to people as well. You also get into
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:27.840]   specialties within the practice. So for example, there are financial planning firms that are
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.440]   boutique estate planning firms and the only service they provide is comprehensive, in-depth,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:39.840]   detailed estate planning services. And so this would be for people with $150 million net worth
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.200]   and all they do is estate planning. That's very different than maybe a new representative at one
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.000]   of the large wire houses who's out kind of beating the streets, bringing in new accounts, rolling
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.120]   over 401ks into IRAs, things like that. Well, when you were at Northwestern, I mean, were there times
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.160]   when you were working with clients and sitting down with them and trying to come up with a budget?
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:05.520]   Yes, there were. Huh. And then so that would be sort of the sort of cash flow management.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.840]   Right. Okay. Would you help them try to figure out a strategy to get out of debt and which debts
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.280]   to pay first and how to find more money to put towards those debts? I would, but it's really
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.840]   tough. And here's why. That's actually one of the reasons why I started the podcast. I would spend a
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:26.080]   lot of time on those types of things, trying to help somebody plan a budget, trying to help somebody
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:32.560]   figure out a debt management plan. But unless there's a compensation
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.480]   arrangement where the planner can actually be paid for the work,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:43.200]   then it's very difficult to spend a lot of time doing those types of things. So at most, maybe if
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.080]   I, let's say I come across a client and I meet with a prospective client and this person, they
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.800]   really need to get out of debt, but they don't have a lot of other needs other than that, that
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.920]   I can help them with. It's very difficult for me to sit down for several hours over a period of
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.520]   meetings and help them for free. Now I've done it, but what I resorted to more than that is actually
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.680]   trying to, I would, you know, for the first few years I would carry around copies of Dave Ramsey's
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.800]   Total Money Makeover book in my trunk. And I would be like, listen, I can't, I can't come back and
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.640]   help you every week and do a budget review with you and show you how to do that. So here, read
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.640]   this book and follow this book. Or I would send them some articles or I would send them to a
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.040]   website or to a podcast, something like that. So there has to be a compensation function where the
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.080]   planner can actually get paid. And the problem is that the people in our country who oftentimes
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.800]   need the most help, who need the help with getting out of debt, who need help with setting up a
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.920]   budget, something like that, they also aren't, they're not in the position to be able to afford
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:47.040]   the best, the best advice because they just simply either can't or won't pay for it. So you have this
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.280]   very strange dichotomy that the wealthy are willing to pay massive amounts of money for excellent
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.360]   financial advice. This is what, and every time Congress passes new tax laws, I do not understand
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.200]   why they do it the way they do. And I just, I tell my friends, you know, if we're sitting down
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.800]   having a cold drink, I say, do you not understand that there are, does Congress not understand that
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:14.640]   there are armies and armies and armies of us, we financial planners, attorneys, CPAs, accountants,
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.240]   things like that, who are going to sit around and we're going to dissect this law and we're going to
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   figure out a way around it. And we're well paid to do it because if we can save a client 2 million
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.480]   bucks in a year and that client will happily pay us 50, 100,000 bucks for the advice. So what happens
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.960]   is, is if you have money already, you can get world-class financial advice. If you don't have
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.520]   money already, it's kind of tough because you can't really afford to pay for it. And those of
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.720]   us who are world-class aren't really going to be able to effectively serve you. So the only way that
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.120]   I can figure out how to actually serve people who are in those needs is doing things like what Dave
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.000]   Ramsey does, where you're giving away great information to kind of a beginning level,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.280]   to a beginning level audience, or what guys like you and me are doing with our podcasts of giving
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.680]   away the information, writing books. And then there are some people who are trying to work in
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.400]   that area as far as like being budget coaches, things like that. I haven't seen it really working
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.240]   effectively yet. My hope is that it will. And then because the needs are fairly simple, the solutions
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.640]   are fairly simple. And there's not a lot that somebody making $40,000 a year with a family
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:28.000]   needs to know. I'll build that up, pay off your debt, fund an IRA, get some appropriate term life
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.440]   insurance. That's about it. Now, if I get a client walk in with $400,000 a year, what I can do? And I
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   can work some tax magic on their situation. I can save them tens of thousands of dollars with the
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.840]   right planning technique. So it's kind of a catch-22, and I haven't figured out how to solve
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.320]   that problem. Okay. And I think we just, we lost a little bit of that last answer. So if someone
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.200]   comes in with making $400,000, let me ask you that. If someone's making $400,000 a year, should they
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.480]   have a financial planner? Absolutely. And what's the financial planner going to do for them?
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.040]   Depends on how good they are. Well, okay. Let's say a very good financial planner, maybe one named
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.240]   Joshua Sheets. I don't know. But what would a good financial planner do for someone that, you know,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.360]   they're making $400,000 a year. They got, you know, whatever, a couple million dollars in the
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.320]   bank, family of four. You know, what kinds of things would that person need?
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.880]   You're going to be frustrated by this answer because there's not one answer to it. And this
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.640]   is one of the – and let me kind of expand on it because this is one of the problems actually with
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:34.560]   selling financial planning services is that people are often looking for one thing and there isn't
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.680]   one thing. So for example, on my show, I've been working through trying to teach through some tax
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:46.000]   planning strategies. And I rely on a statistic from a book. What's it called? How to Pay Zero
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.080]   Taxes I think is what it is or something like that. And in that book, there is a statistic
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.040]   that's quoted. The author, he's a tax attorney up in the northeast somewhere. And he quotes and he
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.280]   goes through each year the various levels of income and the amount of income tax paid by various
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.080]   households and various families. The only year that I remember which is the latest year that I
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.920]   have read in his book, in 2009, he quotes the statistic that in the United States of America,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:20.640]   based on publicly available tax return data, there were over 20,000 – there were 19,000 something,
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:27.440]   so about 20,000 people who made a household income in excess of $100,000 and who paid $0
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.840]   of federal income tax. Okay. Let me just stop you right there. First of all, is this the book by
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:39.280]   Jeff Schnepper? How to Pay Zero Taxes 2014? Big, thick book goes through –
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.800]   I don't know. I'm looking at it on Amazon right now. Yeah. How to Pay Zero Taxes. Yeah. Jeff
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.440]   Schnepper's book. Exactly. So here's my question. I know every situation is different, but just give
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:55.920]   me a rough idea of how it's possible for someone to make $100,000 and pay no taxes. All right. So
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:02.000]   it's a bunch of things. And so it may be, for example, how is their income structured? So is
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:11.280]   their income structured where it's not structured in the form of wages? So you can remove some of
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.360]   your employment taxes if your income is not structured in the terms of wages. What kind of
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.280]   deductions do you have? And Schnepper's book is the best place because he goes through each and
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.200]   every one of those things. So as I actually can't answer the question because there are so many
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:31.120]   little things that you can do. So it's everything from doing – so for example, I love the early
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.400]   retirement community. And one of the things – let's say if you don't need any money,
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:40.640]   if you may have $100,000 for you and your wife, let's say total household income, $100,000. And
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.680]   if you don't need that income, all you need to do if you're self-employed is set up some 401(k)s
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:53.120]   and defer 50 grand into one and 50 grand into the other. And you've cut out your taxable income.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.960]   But let me follow up on that though because you're talking about someone who's self-employed, right?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.280]   Right.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.680]   So that would be an individual 401(k).
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.080]   Right.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.120]   Okay. And you can only put in there though – you've got your employee contribution,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.320]   right, 17.5. And then for the employer contribution, it's 25 percent, right, of your income.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.200]   Right. So I'm being a little bit loosey-goosey with the numbers.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.880]   Okay. I'm sorry. You just got me excited. I'm thinking, "Okay, how do I do this?" All right.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.680]   Right. So buy Schnapper's book because from our conversation, you're detailed enough that you
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.480]   would enjoy it. Buy his book. That's a really good one. And then there's another really good one
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.600]   by a guy – I don't remember the author's name. I have it as well. It's called How to Really Lower
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.120]   Your Taxes Big Time. And it's also good. Schnapper's book is very academic and it lays it
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.560]   out in scope. And he goes through – hang on one second. Hit pause and I'm going to grab it. I'm
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.680]   going to give you the answer.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.960]   That's okay. We'll come back to it.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.600]   Okay. So because if you –
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.880]   By the way, I hate hitting pause.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.840]   I'm going to keep all this in. That's okay. It's the real life of interviews. People who
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.760]   listen to it understand that. But by the way, I will link to both of those books in the show
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.120]   notes for people listening.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.120]   Awesome. And I've also got a tax series. If people are interested in this subject,
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:14.000]   in my attempt to actually teach what I could never find in the personal finance space,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.720]   so I had to kind of read through all the really boring academic books.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.440]   I started kind of teaching through a tax series.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.400]   Well, if you send me links of those, I'll include those too.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.560]   I'd be happy to do that. I'll make sure to do that. So the answer is there's not just one thing.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.680]   There's a number of – there are a number of different techniques that in the right situation
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.440]   could be – and it would be very unusual to be able to wipe out all taxes. I'm not sure.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:47.040]   Those returns that can do that, there may be – I don't want to get too deep into the weeds.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.440]   I've studied some, but I still can't even figure out exactly how it would work to do exactly that.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:58.480]   But it's a lot of things. And so somebody with $400,000 of income, you figure – let's just
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:06.000]   use round numbers. Let's figure 25, 30 percent of taxes. You got $100,000 of income tax.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.520]   There are some easy ways to lower that, and it would usually be higher than that depending on
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.840]   the state, depending on the situation. But you can do a lot as a financial planner,
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.160]   and if you can cut that bill in half, you can do a lot to earn some pretty substantial fees
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.400]   and have a happy client and a happy planner. So here's my concern about hiring a financial
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.560]   planner for me personally. This is my personal concern, is that – in my situation, I grant it's
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.320]   a little different because I spend my days studying this, but I still recognize that
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.680]   there's no way you can know it all, and I certainly don't know it all.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.160]   But my concern is I'll spend a fair amount of money with getting some kind of financial plan,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.600]   and in the end, I'll conclude I didn't really learn anything new.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:54.800]   I spent this money, and he or she didn't really tell me anything new or save me a substantial
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.000]   amount in taxes. Maybe that's a silly concern. I don't know. Did you ever have people come in,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.720]   and you went through a whole financial plan, and at the end of the day,
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.040]   they were already doing things right, and you really weren't much help to them?
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.040]   I had one guy in my career in six years with meeting over 1,000 people. I actually had one
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.240]   guy that fit that mold. Okay, one out of 1,000. All right.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.760]   And I'll tell you, actually, it's an important story. He was also one of the few people to
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.120]   actually ask me proactively for an appointment without my having to approach him with an
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.960]   appointment. And this was very young in my career where I was still just completely scared silly
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.920]   anytime I would talk to people and ask them to talk about their money, just the emotions of the
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.600]   business, learning how to talk with people. And so I went to this networking event here in Palm
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.200]   Beach. It was a lunchtime meeting. I can't remember the name of the club, but it's a bunch
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.400]   of old Palm Beach guys, retired guys that get together. And I thought, "Oh, this would be great,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.360]   a bunch of rich Palm Beach guys." So I go there, and I sit down. I'm the youngest guy in the room
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.920]   by about 40 years. And the guys are asking me what I do, and I say, "I'm a financial planner."
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.280]   Well, at the end of the luncheon, one of the gentlemen leans over to me and he says, "Listen,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:10.240]   hey, I'd like to have you take a look over my stuff if you could and if you would." And I said,
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.160]   "Yeah, I'd be happy to." And inside I'm falling off my chair because this is the first time
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.040]   someone has said, "Joshua, can you look at my stuff?" All up until now I've been out prospecting
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.280]   and basically jumping out of bushes at people and asking them to talk about their money. And
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.880]   you've got to deal with a certain amount of rejection. Well, he comes into my office,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:33.440]   and he walks in, and he's in his early mid-60s, and he slides a piece of paper down. And on the
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.400]   piece of paper, it has a complete balance sheet, all of his assets, all of his liabilities. It has
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.800]   an income statement, very simple, just an income statement showing what his sources of income is.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.120]   It shows what his expenses are, shows what his concerns is, and on one sheet of paper,
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.600]   he basically has his complete financial plan. And I sit down, and this is the first time anyone's
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.920]   actually put that in front of me, and I was like, "Wow, this is great. Why doesn't every client have
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.280]   this?" I was still learning how to do it for clients. And I go through it, and I ask him some
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.560]   questions. And about 15 minutes later, I tell him, I was like, "Listen, I think you've got everything
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.320]   squared away. The only thing I can think of is maybe this one area, but even that, frankly,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.640]   I don't think you need to worry too much about it. So, I think you're pretty well squared away."
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.440]   And I learned something from that experience. So, I couldn't actually make a recommendation
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   that helped him, and I learned something from that experience. When I started working as a
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.920]   financial planner, I thought that the easiest people to meet with would be the poor people,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   would be the broke people, because they would need the most help. And the most difficult people to
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.840]   meet with would be the rich people, because they would have all the money, and they'd have everything
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.680]   taken care of. Well, I've made a lot of phone calls in my career. You've got to, as a financial
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.720]   planner, you have to learn how to make some phone calls to get some appointments. The easiest people,
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.840]   in some ways, I found to reach were actually the rich people. And the hardest people were the broke
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.720]   people, because the broke people were so concerned about their situation, and they were so embarrassed,
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.040]   basically, about their situation, that they would not want to talk about it. They would not want to
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.520]   tell you anything. They would not want to reveal themselves naked, basically. But the rich people,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.840]   now, I might only get five minutes, but he'd give me five minutes, because he'd figure, "Well, maybe
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.680]   this guy's got something I need to know about. Maybe he's got an idea. Maybe he's got something."
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.640]   And I learned I had to be very quick on my feet when working with wealthy clients, but that they
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.960]   were more likely to give me time than poor people. And I thought, "Hmm, is it the fact that they're
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:31.440]   that way because they're rich, or did they get rich by seeking out and taking good advice?" And
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.520]   I'm inclined to think, maybe just to make myself feel good, I'm inclined to think it's the latter,
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.360]   but I can't prove it. Well, it's interesting. And maybe I need to reach out to a certified
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:46.800]   or a financial planner at some point. One of the mistakes that I made was assuming that my
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.480]   tax accountant was also a financial planner. Right. Because, and not even on the insurance
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.040]   side, I wouldn't expect him to evaluate my insurance, but even on tax issues. So, I had
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.920]   an accountant for a number of years that did my taxes, and not once did he mention to me, "Hey,
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.640]   you really ought to consider a backdoor Roth." Not once did he mention to me, "You ought to
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.240]   consider for your business a defined benefit plan." Right. Not once did he... And the other thing he
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:23.120]   did is that he made the mistake of advising me that my 401(k) contributions at my employer
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.320]   limited the amount I could contribute to a completely unrelated SEP IRA with my business.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:40.880]   So, he's perfectly fine at preparing tax returns, but wasn't great at tax planning, which,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:48.160]   as I think about it, frankly, he should have been. But, as I sit here and think, "Should I go talk
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:54.480]   to a financial planner?" Maybe it's an obvious answer, yes. So, for folks that are considering
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.640]   that, how do they find a good one? Yeah. I don't know an answer to that question.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.800]   Okay. Well, listen, it was great to have you on the show. Thanks.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:08.160]   So, I think a lot about that question, and I do not know how to answer it. And let me answer
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.480]   connected to your accountant question. I have struggled with this as well. I have worked with
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.680]   a number of accountants here in my area, and it's very difficult to find an accountant who has a
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:25.520]   proactive planning practice. And the key is that you've got to look at the structure of incentives.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.520]   And this is a problem, in my opinion, in the financial planning business and in the accounting
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:35.280]   business. In general, most accountants are being paid for the production of a return. That may be
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.360]   very simple as far as, "Hey, I need my 1040 simply for my personal taxes." It may be more returns. So,
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   we're doing a couple of corporate returns. We're doing some individual returns as well.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.800]   But basically, the incentive structure and the payment is being made usually for the returns.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.640]   Now, I've heard that there are some very high-end accountants who are providing advice on the basis
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:03.600]   of an hourly fee or something like that. But most clients are so slow to actually walk into
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.560]   their office and plunk down 500 bucks for an hour of time that most accountants are going to
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   recognize that the more returns they can do, the more money they're going to make. And that is the
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.320]   fact because that's what they recognize. And so, the structure that many accounting offices are
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:26.800]   going to is there may be one CPA or a couple of CPAs, and then there are an army of return
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.120]   preparers. And those preparers may be there in the office or they may be outsourced. They may be in
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:37.680]   India. Who knows? And the CPA is just taking a quick look at it. And they can produce a much
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.480]   higher hourly wage by focusing on that than they can by meeting with you and doing some
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   proactive planning. So, I've found that most of the accountants are very willing as long as I'm
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.280]   not calling during tax season to sit down with me. But they're not accustomed to thinking that way.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.680]   And it's the same thing with financial planners. So, as a financial planner, you have to look at
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:05.440]   how your planner is being paid. So, let's say that you are paying an advisor and you're paying a
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.000]   management fee. So, let's say that you're paying a 1% fee on your portfolio and you're paying that
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.600]   for management. Now, if you've got enough assets and you're a big enough fish in a planner's
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.280]   portfolio, they can afford to spend time with you throughout the year. But even in that situation,
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.480]   which is probably the better of most of the situations, they're less incentivized to actually
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.320]   spend a lot of time doing that proactive planning with you because they're getting paid based upon
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.800]   keeping the assets. All they got to do is keep the assets. Same thing with commissions. If you're
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.120]   earning your income off of commissions, whether that's the sale of investment products or insurance
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   products, then you're going to be spending your time focused on what makes you more money.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.880]   So, let's say that I'm selling you a life insurance policy and you're buying the life
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:55.360]   insurance policy from me. Then, once you buy life insurance, you probably don't need any more.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:01.280]   So, it's more in my interest to go and find another person who needs life insurance and
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   call you in a year than it is for me to come back next month and sit down and go over your
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.720]   budget with you and sit down and go over some of those things with you. But I do have a solution.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:17.120]   The best idea that I've come up with is the idea of basically billing your fees.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.480]   In my opinion, and you see a lot of advisors testing this, but instead of billing a fee
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.400]   that's based upon asset management, instead of billing a fee based upon the sale of
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   financial products, billing a fee that's a pure retainer for advice. So, this is often done on
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.520]   an annual basis or it can be done on a monthly basis. And so, the best thing that I've come up
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.480]   with is I would love to have a stable of clients who are paying me a monthly fee and it'd have to
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.920]   be a fairly high monthly fee in order for me to do this, but who are paying me a monthly fee
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.880]   and who could fire me at any time. And in exchange, what I expect them to do is I expect
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.560]   them to talk to me every month. And then what can happen is in the context of a deep conversation
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:04.000]   and in the context of a relationship, we can continually look at tweaking things because
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.920]   there's no way that if you meet with your accountant every February, there's no way in
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:14.000]   the world that in February of 2013, excuse me, in February of 2015, he's going to remember in
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.040]   February of 2014 that you've got these things going on and that he needs to research this right
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:24.960]   in the middle of tax season. So, if you can create a much closer relationship between planner and
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:30.800]   client and where that relationship is based upon the delivery of ongoing coaching advice and it's
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.520]   a much closer relationship, then I think you can get better advice. But only a few people are
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.200]   trying this and I don't know if it'll work. So, I think it should, but I don't know if it will.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.320]   - I've seen and I've talked to several financial planners that do, I guess, something similar to
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.920]   what you're describing. They will charge usually an upfront fee for the initial financial plan,
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.280]   although I've seen it reasonably low, 1,000 to 2,000. Although again, if you're trying to climb
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.720]   out of debt, that's a lot of money, but $1,000 to $2,000 and then an ongoing fee of say $1,000
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:10.240]   to $200 a month for that continued support to execute the plan. I just don't know how, I mean,
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   do you have any sense as to whether that kind of arrangement is appealing to the consumers of
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.760]   financial planning services? - We're finding out. And the problem with this is basically that people
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.040]   at a certain income level often have an aversion to paying for advice based upon what it's worth.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.920]   I was at a master's, I was just last, two weeks ago, I was up in Pennsylvania and I was finishing
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.680]   the final class for my master's degree in financial planning. And I'm in a room with 15 other
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:46.000]   advisors and these are all seasoned, experienced advisors. The oldest guy in the room was 75 years
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.320]   old and he had been practicing for 45 years. And his minimum planning fee is 10,000 bucks. I think
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:57.440]   it was 9,500 bucks. That's where it starts. So the average person, I mean, you're coming from
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.800]   the legal background. How often did you find an attorney friend of yours who's making a couple
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.880]   hundred thousand bucks is ready to say, "I'm going to go plop down 10,000 bucks to get some really
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.840]   great financial advice." Pretty rare, right? - Yeah, not too many. Lawyers think they know
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:18.560]   it all anyway. - That is often true as well. I had a few attorney clients, but I generally found that
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.360]   I had better, I enjoyed working with business owners, entrepreneurs more than attorneys.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.120]   - Yeah, lawyers are a pain. Anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead. - Okay. You said it, not me.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.520]   - Yeah, yeah. - But so there are,
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.680]   the good thing about it is this. If you actually look at how the financial planning business has
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.880]   developed over the last a hundred years, this business and this profession is very much in
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:47.680]   its infancy. It was just 25 years ago, basically, 2025 years ago, that it would have been normal
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.880]   that very few people actually had a financial planner. Most people would have had a stock
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.880]   broker and an insurance agent. Prior to 1999, with the Financial Services Modernization Act,
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:02.720]   you could not sell insurance and sell stocks. You could not do both of those things. You had
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:09.760]   to either sell stocks or sell insurance. So you had this incredible siloing effect where either
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.680]   you had an insurance agent or you had a stock broker, and then the insurance agent and the
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.480]   stock broker would always be picking at each other, which is why you had these stupid debates going on
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.080]   where your stock broker is saying, "Oh, insurance is a scam," and your insurance guy is saying,
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.680]   "Stocks are a scam. You got to buy my life, buy my whole life insurance or buy my annuities
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.480]   because they're a better investment because that's what I can do." And the stock broker is saying,
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.520]   "Oh, that stuff sucks. Buy my stocks." So A, you had the mutual fund industry develop,
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.840]   which revolutionized stock investing. Then you had the low-cost brokerage world come,
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:44.320]   which revolutionized stock brokering. Then you had the Financial Services Modernization Act in '99
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:49.760]   come, which has revolutionized the business. And so basically, it's only been about 15 years
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:56.080]   that in many ways, the comprehensive nature of a comprehensive financial planner has really
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:02.400]   developed as its own profession. Now, there were people prior to that time who always did
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:07.760]   comprehensive planning. I've known some guys in my firm who were in their 80s and 90s, and they were
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:13.280]   really good. And you would have been lucky to have them as your advisor. But as a business,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.920]   the structure, they had to go above and beyond what many people would do at the time
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:23.280]   in order to make it work. So we're still at the infancy. And what I'm excited about is that over
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:31.040]   the last basically 10 years, if you look at the last decade, actually, the financial planning
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.720]   degree at the undergraduate level now exists. The American College and then there's another
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:44.320]   college also that's producing PhDs in financial planning. So that is adding a lot to the research,
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:50.560]   and that's adding to the ability of once you have some professors with PhDs who are able to go out
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.120]   and teach financial planning at the college level. That means that instead of me, like when I
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.720]   started, I was 23 years old. And I went out and got a Series 6 and a 63 and a Life and Health and
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.680]   Annuity license, and I get started. Now you're having people that are coming in with four years
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:11.440]   of undergraduate education in financial planning. They're coming in basically having, just like many
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.560]   CPAs do, having where they come out of college and they immediately sit for the CPA exam. People are
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.680]   immediately sitting for the CFP exam. And so the whole tenor of the industry is coming up. And then
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:28.320]   because of the incredible pressure, market pressure on fees, because of indexing on mutual funds,
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:33.200]   because of the incredible openness of information, that's put this massive pressure on fees.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.680]   And planners are having to turn around and say, "What am I actually delivering for my fee?"
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.480]   And that is awesome because it's bringing a great market forces, and it's really raising
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.800]   the caliber of the industry. Yeah, it's interesting the whole fee arrangement and
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.440]   this idea of the monthly fee. By the way, have you started taking clients under this approach yet?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.520]   No. Do you plan to? Have you figured out a time when you may launch this?
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.560]   It was supposed to be a couple months ago. Are you going to get a few more letters behind
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.320]   your name first? What are we waiting for here? Okay.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:09.280]   Frankly, when I left my firm, I left because I wanted to start the show. I loved my firm.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.560]   I had an awesome experience. I had an awesome stable client base. And the most difficult
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.880]   decision that I've had to make was actually leaving that because I walked away from a lot
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.080]   of very happy clients. I walked away from a phenomenal situation. I didn't have any reason
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.560]   to leave except that I was looking around the financial media space. And I'm looking and I'm
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:34.320]   saying, "Look, there are a lot of well-intentioned people, but there's a lot of really bad information
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:39.840]   that's getting put out there." And I couldn't find a year ago, I couldn't find many people
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:45.280]   that were producing audio. There are some good blogs, really good blogs. I think you were blogging
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.960]   more than a year ago, but I couldn't find people that were producing great audio or video content
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:55.200]   to actually teach people financial planning. Everybody had an agenda. They were either
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.800]   selling their book or they're selling their firm on Saturday morning on AM radio, which
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.440]   is nothing wrong with that. But nobody was giving the nitty gritty and the details. And so I said,
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.320]   "Somebody's got to do this." And I decided that I was going to do that. But with my show,
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:16.480]   the challenge has been just simply, my show is a daily show and it's in depth. So to be
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.240]   prepared for that show, how many shows, Rob, are you putting out per week at this point?
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.280]   Well, I tend to put out two to three. I'd like to put out one every weekday,
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:33.680]   but I just don't have the systems in place yet to do that and still have time to sleep.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:41.040]   Yeah. It takes a tremendous amount of time to produce content, especially if that content is
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:46.480]   teaching content. So an interview is relatively easy. All you got to do is ask some good questions.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.040]   And if you can find some engaging guests, things like that. But I mean, I listened to your show on,
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.200]   what was it? You did one on, it's like Roth five-year rule or something like that.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:55.760]   Right.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   And I guarantee you, it took you several hours at a minimum to prepare for that show, right?
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.000]   I hate that rule. Those rules drive me crazy.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.800]   It's awful. It's awful. But you've got to be so detailed and so careful, but yet you can actually
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.520]   present the information. But the time it takes to prepare for that is tremendous. So I produce a
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:18.160]   show every weekday. And so that probably takes, I would say four to six hours a day to produce it.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.920]   Plus, I don't have a clue. You were ahead of me when it comes to actually knowing how to run a
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:28.960]   website and all that stuff. I'm a total ignoramus when it comes to techie stuff. So my learning
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:34.400]   curve is huge and I just haven't been able to make the time to produce a great show and also to get
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:38.000]   the firm going. So I'm still working on it, but that's why I haven't launched it.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.040]   Well, I want to ask you some questions about your show and your site in just a second,
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   but I want to circle back to one question that you ducked, I think, kind of. All right. So you've
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.000]   got to give the listeners some idea of where, I mean, in terms of trying to find a financial
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.720]   planner, where should they start? I mean, should they go to the fee-only, you know,
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.440]   focus on fee-only financial planners and the association for, you know, or like,
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:07.280]   you know, asking friends for referrals? How do they, give them something to begin the process.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.360]   What should they do? You know, something. Yeah. Okay. So I'll give something, but
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:17.760]   you can caveat it all you want. Well, here's what, here, here's the problem is that there
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.640]   are some things that people will say and I'll give some ideas, but the reality is this.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:30.160]   It is a rare person who goes out and seeks financial advice. Very, very unusual. Most of
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.360]   the time, the reason when people actually start working with an advisor or working with a planner,
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:41.200]   the reason they actually did that is because the advisor called them. And how I worked in my
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.800]   business with Northwestern is I worked on a hundred percent on a referral. It was friend
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.280]   to friend to friend. So if I were working with your friend, Tom, I would say, "Tom, listen,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.120]   I'd love for you to introduce me to some people that you think highly of." And he'd say, "I got
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.520]   my friend, Rob. He's awesome. He's an attorney. He's a really good guy. And I'd call you and then
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.200]   you might give me an appointment. And then at that appointment, you got to kind of test me out and see
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:08.000]   if I know what I'm talking about." And so that is how most people in my experience come up with
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.160]   financial advice. Number two is that even if that's not how it happens and you're taking advice based
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:20.000]   upon the recommendation of somebody else. So let's say that you and I are friends and Rob says,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.600]   "You have an advisor named Jack," we'll throw in a different name, "and you come to me," and Rob
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.680]   calls Joshua and says, "Joshua, hey, listen, my friend Jack, he's having a client appreciation
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.000]   event. I think you would really enjoy going to see him. He's been great for me. Let me tell you,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   my portfolio has gone through the roof. It's just been great. He's done a good job. And I go to the
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.600]   client appreciation event with you." The problem is that chances are you as an attorney, not you as
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.320]   Mr. Finance Guru, but you as an attorney, you probably don't know enough about what you don't
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:57.600]   know to actually judge Jack's performance. So even when people are recommended, it's really hard to
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:03.040]   actually understand is this person technically competent or not. So my answer to it is the number
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:09.520]   one thing I think that somebody needs in a planner is to have a confidence and a trust in that
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:15.680]   person's character. The problem with that is that that is the most difficult thing to manage and to
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.800]   measure and I don't know how to do that other than the fact that I always just said I'm a person of
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:25.280]   character and a man of integrity and I'll always tell the truth and I found that over time clients
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.520]   could figure that out. And so test your planner in some way to figure out their integrity and
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:35.440]   their character. If you have a planner who is a person of integrity, that planner will know what
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:41.920]   they know and know what they don't know. And not everybody needs a high-priced tax consultant.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.800]   If you need a life insurance policy, you need a life insurance policy. And frankly, somebody who's
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:51.280]   been through whatever your state's licensing requirements, a 40-hour class is what it is in
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:58:00.640]   the state of Florida, that person can competently and accurately advise you on how to calculate an
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   appropriate amount of life insurance, on the different types of life insurance that are
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.760]   available to you, and they can educate you on their firm and on other firms so that you can
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.000]   make an informed decision. You don't need somebody with a bunch of letters behind their name
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.640]   necessarily to do that kind of insurance planning. Now if you've got a hundred million bucks and
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.680]   you're trying to set up a second-of-life insurance policy inside an irrevocable life insurance trust,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:29.680]   and you're trying to figure out, "Should I pick a guaranteed universal life policy or should I
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.800]   go with a traditional whole life policy?" You probably are going to want to talk to somebody
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:39.680]   who's been doing this a little while. So it's a very nuanced answer. But to start with, I would
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.760]   say, "What do you actually need and want?" If somebody came to me and they're saying, "Joshua,
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.840]   I want you to manage my portfolio and produce a hundred basis points of alpha," I would say,
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.760]   "Sorry, I don't do that. That's not my deal. I don't know how to do it. Not interested.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.040]   Can't even promise it to you."
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.200]   No one produces a hundred basis points of alpha.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.920]   And most of the listeners right now are wondering, "What the heck is a hundred basis points of alpha?"
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:07.600]   It means an extra one percent of return that's not based upon the general market return.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:15.040]   And basically investment prowess is what that means. And so I would say, "Sorry."
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.960]   Warren Buffett. Okay, keep going.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.520]   Go ahead.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.640]   No, I was going to say, "That's your alpha. Follow Warren Buffett."
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:27.360]   Right. And so I actually, I'm a weirdo. I actually, I believe much of the academic research,
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:34.240]   but I don't believe it to its extent as far as actually all the way. But I mean,
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.760]   it's a long conversation, another time. But the point is, that's not what I do. I'm not a stock
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.680]   picker. So you can't come to me and say, "Joshua, can you do this?" But that doesn't mean that the
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:51.840]   advisors who carefully craft a portfolio of blue chip stocks, even individual stocks, and they
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:58.080]   carefully craft a portfolio to specifically fund the needs of the client's account, they can't do
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:05.280]   that. So I'm going to ask a question, and I think this is valuable information. I've never heard
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.200]   actually this discussed on a podcast. I haven't even talked about this on my show. But the next
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.600]   thing that people go is they say, "Well, maybe if you weed out compensation models that you can then
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.960]   figure out how to get people to be honest." And so you get into the world of fee only versus fee
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:29.920]   based versus commission based. And what fee only means is that you're taking your compensation
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.800]   purely as a fee off of the account and not based upon any special sale of any specific products.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.680]   And the idea behind this model of compensation is that this is theoretically supposed to eliminate
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:48.320]   the conflict of interest between choosing to sell investment company A's products because they pay
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.920]   you a higher commission rate than investment companies B's. And B's products are actually
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.960]   better, but because they pay a lower commission rate, then it's supposed to be better than A.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.040]   I don't buy it. I think there's a lot of crooks that probably that can figure out how to make a
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:09.760]   lot of money in a fee only world. And I've never been in the past a fee only planner. In the future,
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.440]   I will be a fee only planner. But I don't think that that necessarily is gonna affect
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:23.840]   me personally and as far as how I would deliver advice. So, the advice that's probably the safest
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.600]   if I had to give advice is call a fee only planner. And so that would be either you could
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.680]   call somebody with an hourly fee. Two options for that is one is the most well-known option is
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:41.760]   something called the Garrett Financial Planning Network. And they only do hourly fee planning.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.320]   Number two would be an organization that I'm involved with which is called the XY Planning
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.800]   Network. And that's a group of advisors who are primarily targeting Gen X and Gen Y, younger
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.880]   people. And they're trying to, we're trying to build out this monthly model. Or if you have some
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.480]   assets, you can go and contact an organization called NAPFA, which stands for National Association
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.800]   of I think Personal Financial Advisors, something like that. Those are all fee only advisors.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:16.640]   But the reality, Rob, is this. My wife, if I die, she does not have instructions to go online and
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.040]   call a fee only planner. She has instructions to call a friend of mine at Northwestern Mutual,
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.240]   who I trust. And some of my friends and former colleagues at Northwestern Mutual, none of them
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.800]   are fee only planners. But they were men of integrity who did a great job. But man, there
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:38.000]   are some people within even that company who were not, who I would never trust with my money.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.240]   And so it's very much a buyer beware world. And the only actual answer that I have found with this
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.920]   is to say, let me educate the consumer, not with a bias towards this is what we always do,
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.160]   or this is what I believe in. I believe in indexing, or I believe in active investment,
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.320]   or I believe in term insurance, or I believe in whole life insurance. Let me just educate on how
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:07.120]   they work. And then what you should do is press your planner and press your advisor and ask the
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.840]   difficult questions. And I loved it when clients would ask me the difficult questions because it
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.960]   showed they cared about what I was doing. And it showed that they had done enough research to allow
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.960]   me to actually educate them on why in their situation I was making the recommendation.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.360]   And I don't have a better answer than that. That's the best I've come up with, but I'm still working
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.520]   on it. So maybe call me back in a year and maybe we'll have a better answer.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.560]   Well, let me give you my two cents and I promise it'll be worth every penny.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.760]   My two cents is this, and you've alluded to this, financial planning and investment advice are two
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.000]   different things. I mean, they're obviously related, but there really are two very different
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.800]   services. And like you've pointed out, what you enjoy most is the financial planning side. I've
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.440]   talked to, I've got one guy in mind who manages over a billion dollars in assets. And the last
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.400]   thing he wants to do is financial planning. He wants to manage investments. And what I was thinking
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.240]   about, and I took the series 65 and going through all of this, one of the things he said to me was,
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.760]   he said two things. He said, one, forget the financial planning, get the assets under
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.480]   management. That's what he knows. That's what he does. The second thing he said was, you really
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:18.800]   need to think twice before you do both. Because even if you're a fee only advisor, there's almost
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.680]   an inherent conflict of interest because a lot of folks that do both, yes, they pull people in
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.240]   with maybe an inexpensive financial plan. But their real objective is to get assets under
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.280]   management through that introduction. I'll give you a financial plan for a few hundred bucks.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:33.760]   - Right.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:39.200]   - And it may be a perfectly fine financial plan, maybe not. But my real goal is to get
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:48.880]   your $500,000 a million bucks and manage it for 1% a year. And so I see this sort of inherent
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:54.320]   conflict even with a fee only planner. And I think if I were going to get financial, if I were going
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.000]   to reach out to a financial planner, I would want to find someone that charged by the hour or some
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.840]   fixed fee and that had upfront no interest in managing my investments. Don't even talk to me
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.240]   about managing my investments. Now, that doesn't make them a good financial planner. I've still got
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.640]   to figure out if this is someone that I think is competent and has the experience and all that sort
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.240]   of thing. That's not to say that you won't find someone that does both and does it well. I mean,
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:28.720]   certainly that's true. But there is that conflict. And so if I were looking for a financial planner,
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.680]   I would stick with someone who's just going to be a financial planner, even if I wanted someone to
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.640]   manage my investments. Here's the thing, and I'm a big index fund believer, although I do own
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:43.680]   actively managed funds and I own individual stocks. But it is insane to pay an advisor
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.280]   a hundred basis points to manage an index portfolio. Even if you want an advisor, I mean,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.880]   Vanguard will do it for 30 basis points. Rick Ferry at Portfolio Solutions will do it for 37
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:04.000]   basis points. That market is shrinking. There's a lot of pressure on fees. I think the days of
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.560]   charging one and a half percent to manage a portfolio of mutual funds, I hope, is coming
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.880]   to an end. I mean, it's not going to end tomorrow. But those kind of fees just are ridiculous.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   Anyway, one of the things I've thought about, and then we'll get back to your story, but
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.760]   you mentioned maybe charging a monthly fee to work with people on financial planning.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:32.640]   I've thought about the same thing to help do-it-yourself investors. So no, I'm not going
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.360]   to manage your investments for 1%, but I will help you manage your investments for a much,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:43.520]   much smaller fee. Maybe it's an upfront fee for a complete asset allocation plan, and then
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.080]   a relatively small monthly fee so that you have someone you can reach out to,
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.200]   not unlike the financial planning side of things, but this focused on investing
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.920]   to make sure you're on track, make sure you're not making any mistakes, someone to talk to when
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:06.160]   the market's gone down by 10% and you're scared. But a fee that would be far less than paying an
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.000]   advisor 1% or more to stick your money in mutual funds. Anyway, that's my perspective.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:19.200]   Well, I think you make good points, but for a friendly debate among gentlemen that I think
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.120]   will benefit the audience, I'm going to respond to all three of them. Because with another-
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.600]   I made three points? I don't even remember making three. Okay, good.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.760]   Actually, excuse me. You made two, and then I made a note of a third point on the last thing
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.040]   you were going to say. So here is the problem with the approach of trying to find a good
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.880]   financial planner on the basis of a low fixed hourly fee or on the basis of a fixed hourly fee.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.640]   If I am a good financial planner, I am probably a skillful person. And by the way, I'm a very
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.440]   good financial planner. I'm not good at some other things, and that's just- I don't want to be- I
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.000]   consider myself an excellent, competent financial planner, but I'm also good at some other things.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.320]   And so because these- usually people who are capable at learning the skills of financial
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.360]   planning and are adept at working with clients, then that means that you're probably capable
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:13.680]   of other things. So let's compare these two things. And the primary- the most- like the
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:21.360]   ideal business model that I was working at prior to starting at the financial planner is the
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.040]   investment advisory business, and it's very simple. If I have $100 million under management,
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:33.520]   and I just assume that I have a fee of 1%, that $100 million of money under management gives me
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.880]   a million bucks gross into my practice. That million bucks gross after expenses and after tax,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.480]   I'm going to be left with a very nice lifestyle. All I need to have $100 million under management
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.680]   is somewhere between- maybe I need 100 families with a million bucks, maybe I need 200 families
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.240]   with half a million bucks, maybe I need, I don't know, 400 families, although that would be a very
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.520]   challenging practice to keep an eye on. Somewhere between 100 and 200 families. I can create that
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.880]   realistically over a- if I'm a skillful person with some experience, I can build that kind of
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:15.760]   practice over the course of- let's call it 10 years. Now, it could be done less. I know people-
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.680]   you have a friend that has a billion. I know some people here in town that have a billion
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.760]   under management. But those are some massive fees that are coming off of that.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.520]   Even when the fees are substantially reduced, and I'm just using the 1% number purely because
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:36.160]   it's simple to do the math. It is very motivating to people who are capable to have the prospect of
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:42.800]   making half a million dollars of net income, net of business expenses and net of fees, half a million
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:50.320]   dollars of net income with- just by working with 100 families, all of whom love me and who care
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.760]   about me and I care about them. That's a really ideal business to have. Now, let's say that I
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:04.080]   need to make $500,000 of income net. So, that means I need to actually- I still got to bill a
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.600]   million bucks. So, if I'm going to bill a million bucks of income as to go into the hourly model,
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.000]   and this is the problem that people don't talk about very much. If I'm going to get a million
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.840]   dollars of gross fees or gross revenue into my practice, then let's just divide that by 50 and
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:26.000]   let's divide that by 40. That means that my hourly rate is 500 bucks an hour. But here's the problem.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.600]   Nobody can fill a financial- that I'm aware of, can fill a financial planning practice 40 hours
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.320]   a week where you're billing 40 hours. You've come from the attorney world. You know how difficult
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   it is to bill at those rates for that many hours. So, what's the maximum number of hours I could
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.240]   bill? Maybe 10, 15, 20, something like that. So, now I'm at a thousand bucks an hour. And do you
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.600]   know how challenging it is from a marketing perspective to actually reach the thousands of
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.680]   people who you would need to reach to fill that seat across the table from you at a thousand bucks
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.200]   an hour to make the same amount of money that you make with a hundred million under management and
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:12.320]   a 1% fee? And so, it's unlikely. I think there are some very good planners working on an hourly
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.680]   basis. And if you are a middle America person, that's probably great. And you're probably going
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:24.320]   to do fine. But I'm telling you, I'm a pretty capable person and I would view it as- the idea
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.520]   of making an income based upon hourly fees as a financial planner is very unappealing because I
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.080]   can't figure out any way to structure the practice in a way that works and that's a good business.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.200]   It would drive me out of the business. So, I think it's tough to find a world-class planner
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.360]   in that. Now, I know some guys and I want to meet more because I haven't met a lot. And maybe I'll
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.400]   change that opinion in a year. But just from the sheer financial reality of the business, it's
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:56.080]   tough to find. So, yeah. Maybe you could consult an hourly planner and they could do that. But that
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.680]   person may just have- they may have passed the CFP curriculum and they may not know any of the
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.920]   tricky advanced stuff. So, that's my response to thing one. That's pretty depressing because
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.200]   basically what you're saying is, "Look, it's going to be hard to find a really comp- a super
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.400]   financial planner who is willing to work on just an hourly basis or at least an hourly basis that
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.600]   costs some kind of reasonable fee, whatever that is." And you're right. It is tough because
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.720]   they're wanting to do one of two things. They're wanting to sell you something,
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.960]   right? I mean, and I talked to- I've got a good friend who just passed- became a CFA and he worked
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.480]   for a number of advisors and they pushed two things. Expensive annuities. And I understand
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.880]   that annuities sometimes can be a good solution. But I think in a lot of cases they're not. But
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.160]   they push clients into expensive annuities and expensive non-traded REITs. And they did that
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.680]   because it funded their practice. That's how they afforded private school for their kids in the
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:57.600]   country club. And the flip side is a lot of those advisors, instead of doing that, are, "Hey, I'm a
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.360]   fee only and pay me one, one and a half percent to manage your investments." That's how they do it.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:08.080]   I think- but I think on that score that is going to be harder and harder and harder
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.520]   for advisors to do. It won't be impossible. I mean, there are still plenty of people out there
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.240]   that just do not understand the significance of fees when it comes to investing.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.960]   And to them, one percent, one and a half percent, they don't know any better and they pay it. And
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.320]   they, you know, they don't even see it come out. They don't, you know, they don't understand
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:33.520]   what that does to their retirement over, you know, 20, 30, 40 years. So, you know, I guess to your
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.800]   point, though, it may be hard to find a financial planner who's good to work on an hourly basis.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.000]   Although, I don't know, Joshua, I think they're out there, aren't they?
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.080]   I'm sure they're out there. I just don't, like I haven't spent enough time with enough of them
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   to do it. And because the problem with an hourly practice, you have a marketing problem.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.280]   And so, the only way to do it is if you have incredible marketing behind you, you have a
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.440]   world-class podcast of some kind and you're reaching tens of thousands of people, you have a
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.960]   major marketing problem. And that's the issue that comes up.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.880]   Well, anyway, to point one, I absolutely agree with you from the advisor's perspective.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:15.440]   A hundred million under management or perhaps selling a lot of commissioned products would be
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.320]   much more appealing as a business model than the drudgery of hourly work. No question.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:22.720]   No question.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.200]   Agreed. And I spent a lot of time with attorneys here in town and it's like, I don't know an
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.240]   attorney who likes the hourly model. All the attorneys are trying to get away from that as
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.040]   well. Now, it's more problematic because that's the standard. But I mean, were you billing hourly
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.960]   still in your law practice?
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.720]   Always. And the fees are unbelievable. I mean, I can't tell you how many lawyers in my firm
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.480]   charge more than a thousand bucks an hour.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.600]   Right. You have to. There's no way because to be a competent, you always got to look at the
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.240]   market. People wonder, let's not go down that.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.880]   Okay. That was point one. You had two more points.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.480]   Two more points. Okay. So, here's the flip side. And here's the problem with the analysis as I
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.960]   see it. Generally, when people assume that a financial advisor is not worth their fee,
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.640]   their 100 basis points on a portfolio of index funds, they're assuming that the client is going
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.320]   to perform identically well without the services of the portfolio. Excuse me, without the services
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.080]   of the planner. So, what they're assuming is that they're saying, is that this assumption, and
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.800]   this is the problem, and this is also the solution. The assumption is that, well, the client can do
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:31.120]   it themselves. And so, the client is able to go and simply choose some good Vanguard index funds,
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.480]   and that client is going to put the money in there, and they're going to be in as good a
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:41.840]   situation as if they had billed the financial advisor 1%. If that is true, then all financial
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:47.360]   advisors should immediately be fired. But I do not believe it to be true, at least not for me
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.240]   and with my clients. It is inconceivable to me that if I have a good relationship with a client
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:01.040]   who is productive, who is motivated, and who I'm able to encourage, it's inconceivable to me that
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:09.120]   I can't return to that person untold multiples of the fee that I receive. And so, if the example is,
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.480]   well, if you invest and you get a 10% return without fees and you get a 9% return with fees,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.680]   yes, 30, 40 years from now, there's a massive difference in that. But I think, if I were,
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:25.840]   you put me with an 18-year-old, or you put me with a 15-year-old, and you have that person meet with
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.560]   me and talk with me on a regular basis throughout the course of their working lifetime in a very
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:39.520]   close consultative way, I guarantee you that my client would be double, triple, I don't even know
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.480]   because I'm making these numbers up, would be way more wealthy than the other. And here's how and
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:53.360]   why. Number one is that the problem with most investors' portfolios is the behavior of the
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:59.600]   individual investor. And there is a massive amount of research being done and more needs to be done
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:06.480]   about how to help people address and affect their behavior. The average person is not
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:13.120]   emotionally equipped, they're not equipped intellectually, with knowledge, with experience,
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:19.520]   with perspective, to be able to handle the emotion of successful investing. The do-it-yourselfers
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.080]   are. So you, Rob, you are because you've been studying this stuff. But the average person at
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.240]   your firm is simply not because they have no background, no education, and they don't know
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.560]   how to handle the emotion of it. And the studies prove this. You can go and go look up the Dal
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:38.160]   Bar and the Lipper studies and you'll see that basically every year, the average investor
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:46.160]   underperforms their own investment by greater than 50%. It's astounding when you look at it.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.680]   But the reality is that there are a series of very predictable behaviors that that client is
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:57.600]   going to make that are going to cause them to make bad decisions and is going to cause them to get
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.440]   out at the wrong time when they should be getting in and get in when they should be getting out.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.160]   And this can be on a micro scale as far as whatever the latest technology is that we're
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   going to, you know, the next bubble is going to pop or this can be whatever the greatest next
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.160]   depression is going to come and we're going to get destroyed out. The number one thing that an
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.840]   effective financial advisor has to be able to do is to be able to help the client manage their
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.160]   emotions and manage their behavior. And that is what I told every single one of my clients,
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.640]   that they should, they need to hold me accountable for and I expect from them because that's the
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.320]   only thing I can promise. I can't promise that I can outperform. In fact, I actually don't care
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.680]   if I were running a business, a portfolio of actively managed funds or index funds. I could
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.560]   do well in either because I can make arguments for either. So to me, that's not the most important
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.560]   horse in the race. The most important is did I help the client understand their plan and stay
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.200]   with their plan? Number two, there are a whole host of behavioral modifications that a good
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:03.200]   financial advisor can make in a client's life that have nothing to do with their portfolio,
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:07.280]   whether it's the type of account that they hold the portfolio in, whether it's the amount of
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.440]   money that they put in the portfolio, or even whether it's where they invest their money
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:18.160]   completely disconnected with mutual funds. What's going to make a bigger difference? The person
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:26.480]   getting an extra 1%, cutting out a 1% fee and funding their account at the same amount,
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.080]   or me as their financial advisor coming alongside and saying, "Listen, Rob,
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   you're doing well, but you need to really enhance your career right now."
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.080]   And so I've heard about the... What field of law were you in, Rob, when you were practicing?
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.600]   Rob Gagner I still am practicing.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.840]   Peter Bell: Okay. Is it corporate or litigation?
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.080]   Rob Gagner I do. It's funny. I don't know that I've ever
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.600]   really discussed this on the show. I defend auditors of publicly traded companies in
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.680]   proceedings brought by regulators such as the SEC and the PCAOB. I know, very exciting stuff.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.480]   Peter Bell I like that. I'd actually love to talk to
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.600]   you about some time. I'm reading through the history of the financial crisis,
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:05.040]   and I just read a case study on country... Rob Gagner Countrywide?
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.880]   Peter Bell No, not countrywide. It was the other
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:14.320]   subprime mortgage company, and it doesn't matter. Anyway, the point is that in your career,
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:19.280]   the number one most valuable asset that you have and the best investment you can make is in your
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.640]   income. So the difference between coming out of law school and getting your first associate job
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:31.200]   and making 70 grand, grinding out paperwork in the back office versus becoming partner of a big
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:38.320]   firm that gets contacted when we're being sued by the SEC or the FTC or whoever it is that you're
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.160]   defending your auditors and having the potential, and I'm not saying you make or don't make. I don't
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.080]   have any knowledge, but then going to become a partner and making $3 million a year, that's all
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:55.360]   career development, and that all has to do with good financial planning and good financial advice
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.640]   as far as me coaching you to build your career, me coaching you on having the appropriate coverages
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.720]   in place, me coaching you and forcing you to get out of the office and go take a vacation.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:10.160]   And so what I learned is that a good financial planner is much more than a numbers guy. It's
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.800]   much more about the coaching relationship and kind of almost like this life coach role,
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:20.640]   and if I can build that, there's no doubt in my mind that you give me my client and you go take
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:25.440]   your client and you toss your client into low-fee investments and know a financial advisor and you
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:32.560]   give me my client and you let me coach that client through all of their major life decisions and work
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:37.200]   with them and I'm their trusted advisor, their most trusted advisor they turn to, there's not
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:43.040]   a doubt in my mind that my client would be worlds ahead. And so that's what's missing in this whole
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.840]   conversation. Now, not all planners can deliver that, but all planners can learn to deliver that.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.080]   And then the final thing, and then I'll shut up because you've been very gracious to allow me to
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:59.680]   go on my rant, but the final thing is this. People forget sometimes that it's worth it to pay for
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:04.960]   convenience and it's worth it to pay for skill. At the end of the day, the only reason anybody
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.160]   should ever hire a financial planner is if the financial planner can apply a measure of skill
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.480]   to their situation. And I polled my clients when I was leaving Northwestern. I sat down with my
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.080]   clients, as many as I could get with, and I said, "Listen, I have a question for you. Why did you
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.400]   pay me the fees? Because you know very much, you see it every quarter reflected on your statement,
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.440]   you know the fees I was getting. Why did you pay me that?" What I learned is that the clients
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:35.120]   valued me doing things for them and they valued me applying the skill. They valued partly me
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.800]   just simply doing the work. They valued partly me helping them through their decisions. They
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.280]   valued all the other ancillary services. They valued me helping them on their estate plan.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:49.040]   They valued me helping them on their tax plan. They valued me consulting with them and with
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.200]   their accountant. They valued me talking with their son or with their daughter and helping
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:23:00.960]   those things. And they valued that enough to pay me the fees. The fees are not undisclosed,
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.240]   or if they are undisclosed, they should be. My preference, I would love it if every single
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:13.760]   dollar of commission, every dollar of a fee were very clearly displayed so that it was all out on
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:20.000]   the table. And then let me earn that money. And as long as the client is happy paying me that money,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.520]   and then I can earn it and I can deliver that value. The problem is that the people who are
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.280]   often guys like you, there's nothing wrong with guys like you who are do-it-yourselfers. I was
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.920]   a do-it-yourselfer. But that's not everybody. And so I would recognize that there is a large
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:43.040]   number of people who are capable of being do-it-yourselfers and who want to be do-it-yourselfers.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:48.080]   But these are the people that populate online personal finance forums and online websites and
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.360]   start blogs because then they're going to teach that. And I think that's awesome. We should do
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:57.280]   more. But there's also a large percentage of the population that doesn't want to do it yourself
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   or that can't do it themselves. And that's the people that financial planners work with.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.680]   And so I very rarely see that kind of differentiated in that. And I am very much
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.200]   a consumer advocate. And I want to continue to be a stronger consumer advocate.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:20.640]   And let the consumer choose with their dollars where they put value. And I think the best thing
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.680]   that's happening is all these new options that are coming online. The robo-advisors,
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.080]   just the massive growth of some of the robo-advisors is phenomenal because it's smoking
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.720]   all the really crappy financial planners out of the business. And 10 years from now, there will
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.440]   be a lot of people who are completely dead and gone because they didn't provide any value that
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.240]   justified the money they were earning. And there's going to be a whole team, a whole raft of people
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:50.400]   who are delivering far in excess of the cost of their fees. Rant over it. You were very gracious.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.920]   Rant over. Well, it's funny because I don't actually think you and I disagree so much. I mean,
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:59.600]   for example, there's no question that you're right that there are some people
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:06.000]   that for one or more reasons need or want a financial advisor, to be clear, someone to
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.640]   manage their investments. Either because they just don't want to spend the time to do it,
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.040]   or maybe because they don't feel like they have the skills or the knowledge or both.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.360]   So there's no question that there's a large group of people that fit within that category. Where I
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.440]   think things are starting to change, though, is that that kind of advice is in some ways
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.480]   being commoditized. Right. Exactly. And I don't think that's a bad thing. Now, it's interesting,
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:38.240]   you mentioned robo-advisors. And I've talked a lot about betterment, wealth front, personal capital,
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.440]   although personal capital is a little different. But the thing that'll be interesting to me there
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:51.920]   is these things make investing very, very simple. So if the person's need is, I want something that
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.840]   makes it easier to do, and then I'm comfortable doing it myself, the robo-advisor may be a good
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.320]   fit. But if you're talking about someone who says, I'm afraid that when the market's down,
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:09.520]   I'm going to do something stupid, the robo-advisors aren't a whole lot of help. Right. Exactly.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.160]   But here's the thing. If someone needs that kind of help, and there are plenty of people that do,
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:22.320]   I'm not so sure that the days of paying 1% to 2% of fees under management to get that kind of help,
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.840]   if those days aren't numbered. Because there's already plenty of options for folks that can
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:33.680]   help you do just that, help you stay in the market during difficult times, that have the ability to
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.120]   charge far less. Now, obviously, if you're working with someone and you trust them, and you've worked
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.840]   with your family for years, you're going to stick with them. And that's fine. That's the decision.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.520]   But particularly as the younger generation enters the market, I think it's going to be harder and
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.480]   harder to justify paying those kind of fees. Now, in your case, see, what you're describing for your
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:00.000]   potential future practice isn't a percentage of-- isn't a percent of assets under management.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.600]   You're talking about a monthly fee to provide the kind of services that you've described. And like
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:12.480]   you said, that formula is still a bit untested at the moment. But that's a formula that I think,
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:19.040]   it seems to me, is viable and would result in a practice for folks like you, and maybe me,
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.640]   that would work, but that also results in lower fees for the client. But I guess time will tell.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.200]   One question on this subject, though, before we move on. People say that if you have an advisor,
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.600]   you're less likely to do dumb things with your money. I know that's Dave Ramsey's big thing. He
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.960]   says, go use one of my ELPs, commission broker, pay five and three quarters commissioned fee,
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.720]   but you'll have an advisor, and they'll keep you from doing dumb things when the market's down.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.960]   Are you aware of any actual studies that demonstrate that, in fact, if you have an
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:59.840]   advisor, you're whatever, x percent more likely to stick to your plan? I'm not aware of any. In fact,
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:05.200]   I keep asking this question because I know a lot of advisors, and in '08, '09, you know what they
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.600]   told me? I lost all my clients. They pulled out of the market. And a part of me thinks, well,
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.760]   maybe you weren't doing your job, but that's probably way too judgmental because at the end
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.280]   of the day, the client makes the decision. I can't find a study that actually says, yes,
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.160]   we've surveyed 10,000 people, and those with advisors, whatever, stick with it.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.000]   Yeah, I would really doubt, I would actually doubt if you surveyed 10,000 people that you
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.920]   would find that those with advisors did better because I think there's a lot of really sucky
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:38.160]   advisors out there. And the best thing that happened in 2008 was a lot of people, you know,
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.800]   a lot of advisors got a wake-up call of, hey, I've got a problem, and there was not much good that
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:52.080]   came out of it, but I'm trying to figure that out. But I don't know of any academically rigorous
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.000]   studies that would demonstrate that. I don't know if they've been attempted or not or if the results
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.920]   are I'm ignorant on their existence. It is difficult for me to conceive, and I could be
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:07.200]   deluding myself. I very well could be, but it's difficult for me to believe that given how
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:13.200]   carefully I coached my clients and how carefully I tried to teach them, here's what you can expect,
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.240]   here's the emotions that you're going to feel, here's what's going to happen, hey, guess what?
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.400]   This is going to happen, this is what's going to happen, this is what's going to happen,
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:24.480]   that I couldn't do better. But I can't prove it. And this comes back to actually the other
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:31.360]   point I was going to make, is that proving who does better and what does better. Alpha is not
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.600]   everything. Alpha being the amount that you've beat the market, that is not everything. And
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.680]   people forget this a lot of times when they're actually working with clients, is that the client
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:45.760]   doesn't really care most of the time whether or not they beat the standard and poor's 500 index.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:51.120]   They care about, do I have enough money to put my kid in college? Do I have enough money to retire?
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.200]   And this is the major disconnect between most of the formal academic financial literature
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:02.400]   and the actual experience of actual advisors. Because it doesn't, you know, I've had clients,
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:07.280]   I've talked with clients and it's like, listen, if you tell me that I can hit my goals and these
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:13.440]   goals are excellent goals and we can hit the goals with a 4% return, do I really need to deal with the
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:20.320]   rest of it to shoot for the 9%? It's very often and frequent that a client will say, I don't care
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:27.040]   about the 9%, I want to know my 4% is actually there. So there are a ton of intelligent ways
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:33.520]   to manage a portfolio where the portfolio will always underperform the S&P 500 because it's
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.480]   designed to do that. Building an immunized bond portfolio for a client's, you know, college
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.920]   educational expenses is a tremendous value and probably every single time that will underperform
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:49.200]   the S&P 500. So there's a big difference between the academic side of analyzing mutual fund
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:55.440]   performance versus other performance and actually working with a client's financial goals. But I
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:01.120]   will give you one piece of data that you may enjoy and your audience may benefit from. You think that,
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.320]   and I don't know if I agree or disagree with you, I've taken the disagreement tact,
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.640]   but I could argue it too. You know? You sound like a lawyer.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:15.440]   Now, I actually do disagree on this basis about the indexing is not going to destroy fees.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:21.360]   I can, so right now I think I will do the monthly fee approach because that seems the most
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.120]   straightforward way. But frankly, the reason I started the podcast and the reason I do this is
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:31.280]   because I want to create the media and I want to create a much bigger depth of media. And if I
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:39.200]   didn't feel that over time that if I can serve my audience and my audience can choose to pay me for
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.680]   the service that I provided, if I didn't feel that I could do well financially with that in the long
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:49.760]   run, I would never have left the business that I left just to start this new firm idea. But I do
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.440]   think the firm idea is going to work. But there's a mutual fund company called Dimensional Fund
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:04.000]   Advisors, DFA. And DFA is, I think, the number two biggest indexing fund company in the world.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.760]   All they do is passive investing. It's all indexing. But you cannot buy their funds on
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:15.120]   the retail market. I know. I hate that fact. Right. I hate that fact. But here's what,
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.520]   and here there's a whole level of sophistication here that is often not discussed, but I'll mention
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:28.240]   why. The reason why you cannot buy their funds on the retail market is because they need advisors to
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.640]   control their clients. And in the mutual fund business, this is called hot money. So if you're
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:37.360]   managing a portfolio and you're a portfolio manager of a mutual fund, the worst thing that can
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.440]   possibly happen is if all of a sudden your investors call up and they're saying, "Hey,
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.200]   I need my money and you've got to sell out." This is why in hedge funds, hedge fund management,
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.280]   you've got a lockout period where you put the money in and you cannot get it out for whatever
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.400]   the lockout period is. So in the mutual fund business, though, the mutual fund portfolio
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:33:00.080]   manager doesn't have this option. So I think, I can't prove this, and I haven't read it,
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.960]   and maybe the academic literature addresses this, this is just my opinion. But I think one of the
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:12.560]   big challenges that why many times actively managed funds underperform indexes, net of fees,
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:20.320]   is because oftentimes the active fund manager has to deal with maybe more flows. And when you're
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   comparing that to the index, now the index fund maybe has the same thing, so my point may not
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.880]   make sense. But if you're managing a billion dollar fund and all of a sudden market's going down,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:34.000]   your fund has been reduced in price to 700 million, now because there's a 30% general market
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.560]   decline, now all of a sudden your investors start panicking and you've got a hundred million
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.320]   dollars of outflows. That means you've got to sell a hundred million dollars of investments
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:48.480]   when they're all down, and that destroys your performance numbers. So what DFA does is by only
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.800]   selling through advisors, and you have to go through the gauntlet to actually become an advisor
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.920]   with DFA, you have to go through extensive training, you have to go through behavior
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.560]   management training, and you have to teach your clients very carefully what to expect.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:09.120]   But the key is DFA, because they only sell through advisors, they avoid hot money. And so that means
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.960]   that the client who is likely to sell our portfolio when the market declines by 15%,
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.400]   you will not find a DFA advisor willing to work with you, because it would destroy DFA's business
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.760]   model. But what they can do is they can take the approach of passive investing, of indexing,
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:28.720]   and they can use some of these swings. And because they don't have the outflows of their fund
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.520]   that some of the other investment companies have, they're able to produce much better numbers.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.760]   And so what's happening in the investment business is that people often think it's
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.880]   cut or dry. They often think it's either Vanguard or else. It's either passive investing or else.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.560]   Well, when you actually start studying it a little bit, that's not the case. There are a
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.800]   lot of people, and most of the guys that have produced several, I don't remember who's on DFA's
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.640]   board, but many of the guys who, the academics, who actually developed the information that led to
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:02.160]   the resurgent, the growth, the massive growth of passive investing, they're the guys on the board
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:08.400]   advising. And DFA has been able to, on a basis of indexing, bring in some of these other portfolio
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.040]   tweaks that have really helped their performance. And so I think that's a good example. And they are
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:17.920]   a force to be reckoned with in the mutual fund world. So you're going to be paying 1%
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.600]   for an index fund, and they're doing very, very well.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.760]   Yeah, they're on their board of directors. Fama and French are both on their board, as is
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:35.680]   Roger Ibbotson. He's on there too. So one thing I will say, there are studies that show the outflows
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:42.160]   from index funds were lower than the outflows of actively managed funds in the '08, '09 time
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:49.360]   period. I don't disagree with you that it's a mistake to say that all actively managed funds
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:56.640]   are bad. I think it depends on the cost of the fund, its investment objectives, also its market.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:02.080]   I do think it's harder for an actively managed large cap US-based fund.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:02.560]   Absolutely.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.880]   But you get into things like emerging markets and foreign markets and other things,
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.120]   it's a different story. But OK, well, you got the last word on that. I'm going to leave it there.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:17.600]   But I know I've had you on the line here for a long time, but I did want to move over quickly.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:25.840]   So why did you quit your cushy job and leap into the world of podcasting, number one?
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:32.240]   What were you thinking, Joshua? And did you consult a financial planner before you made
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.280]   that decision? And since you've made that jump, two-part question, since you've made that jump,
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.800]   how are you and your family eating?
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:52.400]   Good questions. So for me, I am not heavily motivated by money in the sense of equating
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.840]   net worth with self-worth type of thing. It's easy for people to say, I'm not motivated by money.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:05.200]   Baloney. We're all motivated by money, otherwise, to some degree. But to me, I'm a young man. I'm
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:14.000]   almost 29 years old. And I've lived a phenomenally blessed life. And I have found that I've been
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.960]   happiest in some of the times where I've never spent any money. And I've been privileged in some
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.400]   ways that are just amazing. I've had dinner with the former richest person in the world, not Gates
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:30.960]   or Buffett, and had dinner with his house before he died. And who gets an opportunity like that?
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:36.240]   I was in college. I drove a $2,000 Honda Accord to his house and parked it there and got to sit
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.800]   next to him for an evening of dinner, things like that. So I've learned that very little of the
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.720]   things that I value in life are connected with money. What I do value is time. And I value having
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:52.720]   meaning and joy from time. So when I started my show, it was purely just for fun as an experiment.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:59.520]   And I just got sick and tired of... I got tired of Dave Ramsey, Rick Edelman, Susie Orman, and Clark
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:05.120]   Howard speaking for the financial business. And I like... No, wait a minute. Dave Ramsey helped
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:11.840]   you get out of debt. What happened? Go listen to my show that I recorded with Steve Stewart from
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:17.360]   MoneyPlanet SOS about do financial broadcasters like Dave Ramsey do more harm than good?
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.920]   And what's the episode number? I'll look it up here. Shoot me an email. I'll include it in the
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:30.400]   show notes. That'll tell us your current views on Dave Ramsey? Yes. And Dave has been a huge benefit
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.840]   to me, but it's also some stuff about his advice that's extremely dangerous. And so I was very
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.520]   careful in that show to kind of lay those things out. But I just got sick and tired of it. And
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:47.280]   here's the problem with the financial business is that those who are great at financial planning
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.760]   are usually working in the business. By the way, it's episode 66. So it's RadicalPersonalFinance.com/66.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.160]   Do financial broadcasters like Dave Ramsey do more harm than good? A frank conversation between
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.440]   two fans. So the people that are in the financial planning business, they can't speak to the public
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.320]   because everything they speak to the public is marketing. So I sat down one day and I just like,
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:12.000]   "You know what? I can't do this, but let me just sit down." And I sat down with a digital voice
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.520]   recorder in the middle of my bed and I just said, "I wonder if I could create some audio content."
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.440]   I just started talking and I was nervous as anything at first. But then I found I really
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.400]   liked it. And so I did it anonymously and I tossed some files up on the internet. I didn't tell
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:31.120]   anybody who I was or what I did. I just said, "Let me try this." And I did it for two weeks.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:37.360]   And what I found was I found that people talk about do what you're passionate about and that's
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.440]   fraught with problems and it's also wonderful advice. But the problem is that I've always
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.200]   been working at getting closer and closer to the things I love. And I love doing financial planning.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:51.040]   But what I found when I was teaching that I really enjoyed it and I loved the teaching of it.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.360]   And so I found myself getting up. I don't like to get up early. And I found myself getting up
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.080]   at 5am, 4am, working in the morning for four or five hours trying to figure out like, "How could
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:05.120]   I create some really useful media content to teach people about financial planning?" And then I go to
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.640]   the office and I'd work my nine or ten hour day and I'd come home and I'd be excited to think
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.960]   about what I was going to do the next morning. And I said, "Wow, this is amazing." And then I saw
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:24.800]   people starting to create content online and see people building very healthy businesses with their
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.920]   online content. I said, "I wonder if I could do that." So I had to take the show down because I
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.280]   was doing it unauthorized and I was licensed and everything. But I recognized and I said, "Wow,
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:42.240]   I loved doing that." When I sit down and I develop an outline around some information,
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.680]   I sit down in front of a microphone and I speak to the audience. I enjoy doing that.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:51.120]   And when I sat down and I said, "What would I do if I had 10 million bucks in the bank?"
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:41:00.320]   For the last 18 years, probably 17, 18 years, I've been obsessed with finance and obsessed with
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:06.000]   kind of finding the angles and the tricks and the little things. And I said, "I would do that if I
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.720]   had 10 million bucks in the bank. I don't have 10 million yet, but I would do that if I did.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:16.080]   And I can do it now and I think I could ultimately find a way to earn an income on it."
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:23.200]   And so I said, "Okay, I will do that." So I made plans, but the problem was that I made a couple
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:29.440]   of dumb moves in my own personal finances. My wife and I, this was an extra challenge as far
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.560]   as me figuring out a business transition because the world of podcasting and blogging is very much
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:38.880]   like the world of writing books. Everyone wants to write a book and the people that actually do
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:45.440]   are few. And those who do, the vast majority make no money. A tiny, tiny small percentage make a lot
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:51.760]   of money and maybe a slightly bigger but still really small percentage make some money. So you
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.640]   can't exactly say, "Oh, I'm going to go start a podcast and have that be a great financial plan."
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.640]   That's kind of a dumb move if you're doing it for the money.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.880]   I will second that, by the way. Keep going.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:07.120]   Right. So I knew that I wasn't willing to do that. But the problem was I have always been a good
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:15.200]   saver. But my wife and I, after a lot of time and whatnot, we bought a house. But when we were
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.560]   shopping for a house, we bought a house in 2013, January 2013. When we bought a house, we bought
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.720]   very carefully. We bought a house that was in the neighborhood exactly what we wanted. It was three
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.280]   tenths of a mile from my office so I could save a lot of money, didn't have to commute. It was
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.720]   exactly what we wanted, but it was twice the price range that we wanted to spend on the house.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.640]   But when we had shopped with the price range we wanted to spend on the house, then we
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:49.520]   weren't able to find a house in that range that was going to work. So we went ahead and increased
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:57.600]   our price range. So I bought the house up at $50,000 down on the house and that wiped out a lot
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:02.880]   of my savings. So instead of being able to have this nice cushy position where, "Oh, okay. I'll
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.960]   close my practice down," and I walked away from a lot of money to leave and start a podcast. But
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:10.800]   instead of being able to walk away and say, "Oh, I'll shut this practice down and this is going to
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:15.120]   be great. I've got a couple of years of income in the bank so it's no big deal. I don't need to
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.800]   worry about it." All of a sudden, I found myself strapped for cash because all my money was locked
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.440]   in a house and home equity and locked in retirement accounts where I couldn't get it out.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:28.240]   So I stressed about this for a while and I didn't see a way out. And I figured, "Well, I just got
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.800]   to keep doing financial planning." But the problem with financial planning, if you're planning to
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.640]   get out of financial planning, you're going to be a really bad planner. Because every time I would
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.320]   look a new client in the eye and create a new plan, they're giving me their trust that I'm
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:47.120]   going to be there to care for them. And then now if I know, "Hey, I like this podcast thing. I'm
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:50.640]   going to leave in two years. I just need to save a bunch of money so I can do it," that wasn't
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.800]   working. So finally, I sat down with my wife one day and we decided, "I'm going to do it. I'm going
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:00.160]   to figure it out." And what helped us is that we're pretty frugal. We don't need much money to
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:06.000]   live on. We need about $3,000 a month to live on at our current lifestyle. So that means I figured
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.480]   out. I said, "Listen, I can go and get another job. And if I just get a job that's outside of
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:17.120]   the financial business, then that will allow me to create the show. And I'll just work eight hours on
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.360]   the job, eight hours on the show, and I'll sleep eight. It'll be good. Everything will work."
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:26.320]   So I don't mind working a couple... Basically, I don't mind working two full-time jobs for a while,
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:31.360]   not forever, but that worked. So I started pursuing options and I looked for a few different
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.040]   things. I looked for some dead-end stuff. I went and delivered pizzas for a week because I heard
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:42.080]   you can make a bunch of money doing that. Not true. But I figured if I could go deliver pizzas
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.120]   for five nights a week and make $3,000 a month, work five hours a night for five, six nights a
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:52.080]   week, that'd be great. It'd be perfect. Unfortunately, I couldn't. It was not worth any
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:59.280]   time. So I went and then the whole time trying to figure out, "Okay, do I start the new firm?
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.880]   How do I structure it?" All that kind of stuff. So the show at this point, it's three or four
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.880]   months old. I'm on episode 77, I think I just posted today, or 78. And I love doing it. And
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:17.600]   the response from the audience has been wonderful. It's been humbling and awesome. And I feel like
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.720]   they're starting to coalesce a group of people who are really benefiting from it and who are
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.280]   doing that. And my hope is that I think I can bring other services and other products to them
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:33.200]   with time that will allow me to actually earn some money from the show. And in the meantime,
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.680]   I wound up working out a consulting contract in the financial planning business. So I have a
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.240]   consulting contract that pays my bills and that frees me up while I start the new firm. And then
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.680]   I expect the new firm, if I can ever wind up actually getting it going, I expect that to fund
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:52.560]   my life. And then thankfully, I've still got a pretty decent cushion of cash in the bank, which
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:58.560]   is also kind of my... I don't like to spend money. I don't like to spend reserves. I know many people
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.040]   will start business off of that, but I prefer just earning income as I go and keeping the cash and
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.200]   reserves in case something goes wrong. But that's my story. So that's how I started the show.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.280]   - Wow. Okay. You're enjoying it so far, I take it.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.640]   - I love it. I love it.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:14.080]   - You're happy with your decision?
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:14.960]   - Thrilled.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:16.480]   - Your wife's happy with your decision?
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.960]   - She likes seeing me happy and having the ability to...
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.480]   - That's a good wife to have.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:30.160]   - Right. You know what's refreshing is I'm a pretty crazy guy. You could probably pick that up.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.760]   - I had not noticed that, Joshua. Also, you don't have very strong opinions about things.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:39.680]   You're kind of wishy-washy. You really are. I don't know. You might want to look into that.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:48.240]   - Build a backbone and find out about opinions, right? So, the cool thing is that I love to...
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:54.640]   My show is called Radical Personal Finance, but the problem is that what I learned for the first
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.920]   time and I never recognized it because I've been self-employed for the last six years.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:04.000]   I never got a paycheck. Everything was based upon if you work and you produce,
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.200]   then you make money. That's how my life has been for six years. So, I'm very comfortable
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:12.240]   with the topic of entrepreneurship. But when you're behind a larger corporate umbrella,
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:20.560]   I never... You have responsibilities to the brand of the umbrella. So, you can't be as crazy as I
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:28.080]   often am. After I left and I was kind of just on my own, I recognized the awesome responsibility of
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:34.320]   that, but also the total freedom. So, now on my show, I interviewed a guy who's a war tax protester,
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:42.640]   hasn't paid taxes since we invaded Iraq. So, it's 13, 14, 12 or 13 years by now. I did a show on
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:48.800]   what we can learn from dumpster divers and vagabonds and hobos. And I do shows on in-depth
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:56.560]   complicated tax planning. I'm planning some shows on how to do multi-billion dollar trusts for estate
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:06.000]   planning. And so, to me, I enjoy those crazy, far out, wacky subjects. But that's tough to find a
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:12.640]   firm who's got to be conservative. Put it this way. There's not a chance in the world that Vanguard or
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:17.840]   American Funds or Fidelity would ever sponsor my show. And that's okay. I don't need them to
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:22.560]   because they've got to protect their brand image. But I enjoy being able to
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.080]   look at these subjects that many people don't look at.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:31.840]   - Right. Well, that's terrific. And I've started listening to your show and have enjoyed it very
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.000]   much. And I haven't listened to the tax strategy episode yet. So, I'm going to focus on that
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.200]   myself. One question about your show, and then I'm going to have some rapid fire questions for
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.800]   you at the end, okay? Which I suspect you'll be brilliant at. Here we go. The first question
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.680]   about your show. I noticed you use SpeakPipe, which allows people to leave you a voice message.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.800]   - Right.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:56.080]   - I toyed with that for about a day and a half. It's not on my site at the moment,
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.840]   but I have a SpeakPipe account. So, a listener could, rather than emailing you a question,
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.600]   they could leave you a voicemail and then it would give you something to play on your show. So,
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.400]   the other listeners could hear the person asking the question. Are your listeners embracing that?
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   - They are. I think I've received... It took me forever. I am not a techie guy. I can't stand the
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.920]   techie stuff. So, it took me... I've threatened to do it for like four or five weeks. And I
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:22.160]   finally installed it about three or four weeks ago. And I think I've received something like
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.920]   six or seven voicemails now.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:24.400]   - Okay.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.120]   - Which has been great. And I cleared them all out on last Friday's show. And I forgot... Thanks
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:32.240]   for reminding, by the way. I forgot to tell the audience, "Listen, if you guys want to answer
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.560]   questions, call them in again." So, I got to remind the audience about that.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.800]   - All right. I'm going to put that back up. I get a ton of email, which is great. But I think
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.080]   it'd be kind of fun to hear people's voices and play that. So, I'm going to give that a try. Okay.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:42.960]   - I think it adds a lot.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:44.320]   - Rapid fire questions. You ready?
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.120]   - Ready.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.400]   - Okay. Best personal finance book. What do people read?
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.560]   - Richest Man in Babylon. No question.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.920]   - How about for investing? Same one?
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.880]   - Just a minute.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.240]   - Tick tock. Tick tock.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:07.360]   - The investing one is hard because I don't like how most people just... When they hear
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:07.680]   investing...
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.920]   - This is a rapid fire Q&A.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.160]   - There is no one book on investing.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.360]   - Okay. Fine. You don't have one on that.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.120]   - But I'll give you one actually. Here's what it is. If somebody has passed just the novice
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:26.800]   level of investing, read a book called The Fund Industry by Robert Pozen and Teresa Hamaker,
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.760]   something like that. And you will gain insights into the managed money business that you've
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:35.680]   never known. And you will not find any of this stuff in the personal finance world. So,
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:37.360]   read a book called The Fund Industry.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.120]   - All right. Do you use a tool for your budgeting?
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.200]   - I keep an Excel spreadsheet and I don't budget.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.960]   - Excel spreadsheet, you don't budget.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.680]   - I don't... Meaning I don't budget proactively in a forward-looking manner. I do it in a
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:51.840]   month by month. I take a look at the previous month.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.000]   - Okay. Do you use tools to track your investments?
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.200]   - No.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.320]   - No? Okay. Your investments, what are you invested in? Let me ask you this. What's your
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.120]   asset allocation?
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.800]   - 100% stocks.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.680]   - Wow. 100% stocks. Crazy guy.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:11.760]   - I don't get bonds. This is purely for me, not client advice. But I think it's very simple.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:17.520]   Owners get richer than lenders. And I have a stomach of steel when it comes to volatility.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:26.480]   And you will always have the highest total average return from 100% stock portfolio versus
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:31.360]   in my opinion, and I think there's good academic research for this, but you'll always have the
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:37.360]   highest total average return from stocks versus bonds simply because of the inherent volatility.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:42.560]   If you can handle the volatility, you're going to get richer with stocks. But the vast majority
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:47.040]   people can't handle the volatility. I have a stomach of steel, so I'm 100% stocks all the time.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.320]   - Stomach of steel. That's the title to your next book, man. Right there it is. Okay.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.800]   All mutual funds or ETFs?
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:58.560]   - Presently, but I'm struggling with actually... I'm having a major... Over the last year,
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:04.560]   I've had a major ethical crisis actually of trying to figure out... I am not comfortable
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.880]   with many of the companies that I own in my mutual funds, and I'm having a major ethical
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:15.200]   crisis from profiting over them. So I am headed down a road actually, and we'll see,
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.640]   but it is possible that in the future I will be selling all of my mutual funds
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:26.000]   and taking over the management of my portfolio myself so that I can control the companies that
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.400]   I'm profiting from. - So in other words, individual stocks.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.800]   - Right. - Because there are mutual funds
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:36.240]   that avoid the sin industry, so to speak. - Right. But the problem is the things that I have issues
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:41.600]   with, almost nobody else does. So for example, I don't care a bit about tobacco companies or
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.160]   alcohol companies, but I'm uncomfortable owning some of the major banks.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:54.880]   And there's a lot of examples. So the social screens for the social mutual funds, I haven't
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:57.600]   found one that actually matters to me. - They probably don't exclude banks,
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:00.240]   I'm guessing. - Right. Things like that. But I don't like
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:03.760]   the banking cartel that we have in this country right now, and I don't want to profit from them.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.400]   And so this is a major personal ethical crisis for me. I never experienced this in the past.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:12.400]   I would always tell clients, "Don't worry about that, just earn the money." But now that I'm
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.640]   going through it, it's causing me to rethink everything, and I'm probably going to be going
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:20.080]   in a different direction with my investing in the future. - That's interesting, because from
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:23.840]   my perspective as an investor, I love monopolies and cartels because they make a lot of money.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.000]   Okay. Your mutual funds, we're almost there, almost done. Your mutual funds, are they primarily
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.240]   index or active or a complete mix? - Primarily active. I have a few index
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.120]   funds, but primarily active. - What mutual fund companies?
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.280]   - American Funds. - Ah, American Funds. So you pay the
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:40.080]   commission or do you not? Can you bypass that, given your background?
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:45.760]   - I just paid the commission, but I paid it to myself. It was a little bit funky when I bought it.
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:48.560]   - Ah, there you go. So you're an insider. So you're one of the people we talk about.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.520]   - Exactly. - Okay.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.920]   Because it just flows through to me anyway. And the commission, by the way, is an interesting
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:04.560]   discussion. The commissions have been destroyed over the last number of years, but we'll be back
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:10.800]   into that conversation. But here's the thing. If I were working with a client, I would almost 100%
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:15.200]   of the time rather have fees than commissions, because commissions are one time. If you're just
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:21.040]   talking about self-interest, people that accuse commission-based sales of investments to be
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:32.800]   wrong as compared to that fee is somehow better, selfishly speaking, I would rather have fees
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:37.600]   because I have larger stable revenue over time as compared to commissions. So I've never bought that
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.800]   argument. So I have some actively traded funds with American Funds and I have some Vanguard funds
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.160]   as well on one of my retirement accounts. - It's funny because I bought that argument
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.480]   for a while, but I agree with you, particularly if you're paying a fee-only advisor 1% or more.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:55.520]   Long-term, if you stick to a plan, you would be better off paying the commission.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:00.080]   - Right. - And American Funds,
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:05.680]   they're good funds. I think most of them that I've looked at are probably in the 60 to 70 basis
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:10.160]   points, certainly higher than an index fund, but also significantly lower than the average actively
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.760]   managed fund. Kind of reminds me of Dodge and Cox that doesn't have a commission, but
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:18.240]   their expense ratio is about the same and I own a Dodge and Cox fund and I think they're pretty
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.320]   good. Of course, a lot of the folks, and I know we're getting off this rapid fire question round
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:28.080]   that I had, but a lot of folks say, "Well, commissions versus 1% fees, commissions win."
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:33.360]   That's true, I think it can win. Although my response to that would be, "But you haven't
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.440]   listed all of the options because those aren't your only two options." - Right. And I would say
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.960]   also you have to look at the service. So, for example, if I sell somebody a commission product
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.760]   and I earn a commission on that, do I have as high of an incentive to come back and service
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:53.680]   them year after year after year? Most of the people, you just buy a small account, I don't
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:56:02.400]   have much of an incentive to respond. But here's the flip side. Somebody has $70,000, you can't
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.880]   charge a fee on that. That is way too small to deal with that. - Right. - So, what happens-
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.280]   - That's why they have minimums. - Right, exactly. And so, that's what happens is people get into
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:17.040]   these discussions and they've never figured, and you get into these academic discussions,
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.720]   and you've never sat with a client that says, "Joshua, I need help with my investments." We'll
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:27.120]   call Vanguard because you've got $22,000. "Joshua, no, I want you to do it." - Right. - What happens
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:33.040]   is if you cut out commissions, you close out the ability to work with middle and lower middle
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:39.840]   America. - Oh, interesting. - And I think that is one of the neglected things that I've heard.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.760]   Now, the other problem is that low and middle America has been screwed time and time and time
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:49.680]   again by stockbrokers selling crap. So, how do you deal with that? I don't know, other than to say,
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:55.600]   find an ethical advisor, a person of integrity, train them well, make them knowledgeable,
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:02.240]   and give them what they need to work with tools in each client's portfolio. And I do want to comment
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.080]   on one other thing on your rapid fire round. - Good, and then I've got one last question. - Cool.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.360]   Just because I misspoke, because you said, I think a moment ago, you said active or passive,
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.720]   and I said all active. That's not right. So, I have some actively managed funds and I have some
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:23.040]   funds at Vanguard, but one's in a retirement account and the other. I think people have to
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:28.160]   look at the actual asset class. And you made this point earlier, but to me, this makes sense to me.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.560]   If you're going to own an actively managed fund, it needs to do something that an index fund can't.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:37.680]   But not all indexes are created equal. So, that's my current opinion. We'll see if it changes. I'm
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:43.120]   going to try to get William Sharp and some of these other guys on my show as time goes on. And I think,
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:46.480]   who knows, maybe they'll change my mind. I don't know. - Okay, one last question. Any favorite
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.600]   online resources, blogs, websites, whatever that you regularly follow in the personal finance and
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:58.960]   investing space? - Radicalpersonalfinance.com. - No, good. That's a good one. - Yes and no. So,
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:06.000]   these days, I don't read many blogs. And I think blogs are really causing problems with people's
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.000]   ability to comprehensively grasp a subject. Meaning that more books, fewer blogs. Because
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:18.400]   blogs, we try to produce something, but we can't produce a coherent story. So, as long as you have
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:23.120]   a foundation in books and you're going back to books for knowledge, augmenting them with blogs
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:29.040]   is great. But if you're not actually starting with books and you're just trying to build an
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:33.200]   education from blogs, it's really tough. Because no matter how well-intentioned or no matter how
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:39.360]   knowledge the writer is, when you're writing 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 word essays, you can't convey a
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:46.960]   comprehensive thought and comprehensively teach. So, I enjoy Pete's blog, Money Mustache.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:53.760]   I enjoy that because he's produced the most motivated group of people. I enjoy Jacob's book,
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:59.520]   Jacob Lundfisker's book, Early Retirement Extreme. I don't look to the blogging community for much on
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:06.480]   financial planning advice. I read, in the financial planning world, Michael Kitsis' blog a lot. So,
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:11.680]   K-I-T-C-E-S.com. - That's good. He's great. - That's what I read for financial planning blogging.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:18.240]   And I like, for wealth building, I like Todd Tressiter's work at financialmentor.com. I think
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:22.640]   he's done a really good job there talking about the wealth building side, which is something that
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:26.880]   is never talked about in financial planning, by the way. - Yeah, he was at FinCon too. - Right.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:29.840]   - Yeah, we had a good time. - All right. Well, great. Well, you've given us a ton of resources.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:34.320]   I'll link to all of them in the show notes as well as to your show. And shoot me an email with any
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:39.600]   podcasts that you think really stand out. I've got the one, episode 66 on Dave Ramsey. But if you
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:42.640]   have any others, shoot me an email. I'll include those in the show notes as well. All right,
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:47.200]   Joshua. Well, listen, I appreciate your time and your views. It was very enlightening for me.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:52.480]   Great having you on the show. - Thank you, Rob. I appreciate it. - Well, as I promised at the
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:59.200]   beginning of this show, that has to be the longest interview I've recorded in this podcast. I hope
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:05.280]   you enjoyed it. A lot of detail. One of the things, Joshua, as you know, very strong opinions
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:12.400]   about the world of personal finance and investing. And I kind of, I love that. And questioning him
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:17.600]   and learning about the business of the CFP and what all those pesky initials are behind his name.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:24.400]   If you haven't already, I encourage you to check out his podcast, Radical Personal Finance. A very
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:31.840]   detailed show. A lot of great stuff. And I think you'll enjoy it a lot. I've listened to a number
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:37.840]   of his shows. Obviously a very knowledgeable person. And my hunch is you've got some questions.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:42.560]   So, you know, you can obviously reach out to him through Radical Personal Finance, and I'm sure he
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:47.360]   would love to get your emails and questions. Also, though, feel free to shoot me an email,
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.680]   drdorler.net, if you have any questions about this episode. Happy to address them myself or
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:56.880]   pass them on to Joshua, if that makes sense. So feel free to reach out to him either way. And,
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:00.960]   of course, you can always reach out to me with any questions or topic suggestions for the show.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:06.560]   I would love to hear from you. And happy to get those emails. Hey, hope you have a great day.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:11.680]   And remember, until next time, you know what it is. The best thing money can buy, financial freedom.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:21.040]   If you're looking for an exciting role in customer service,
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:25.040]   food service, or retail, connect with a job at the airport.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:28.080]   Get started in a role that offers competitive wages,
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:32.640]   consistent schedules, and fast-tracked management while you work in a vibrant,
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:37.440]   exciting environment where security is a priority. The airport has it all.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.640]   You can have it all, too. Visit cmhserviceindustry.com to learn more.
