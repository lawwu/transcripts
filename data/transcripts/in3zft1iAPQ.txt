[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   All right, let's do a cool case study here.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.880]   Let's do one more question
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.200]   and then I have a cool case study I wanna read.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Sounds good.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.440]   This question is from Adam Portillo from New York.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.220]   Can you describe your decision rule for entering a task
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.800]   either onto a travel board
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.440]   versus directly into a weekly plan?
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.900]   I'm finding it tempting easier to put time sensitive items
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.520]   and links directly into my weekly plan,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.140]   but then it gets a little cluttered.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.480]   - Well, Adam, I'll tell you my best practice on this issue,
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.280]   which is not something I always follow,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.240]   but I'm always happier when I do.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.620]   And that best practice is the following.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.680]   So you have, you know, something pops up,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.500]   a task, an obligation, you jot it down
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.920]   and your whatever you use for capture in the moment.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.560]   So for me, it'll probably be my time block planner.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.160]   On the daily pages,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.800]   there's a section for capturing these things.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.120]   And then you get to the end of the day,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.280]   you need to process it.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.120]   My best practice is there's two places
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.520]   where that new task can go.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.420]   Onto an appropriate task board or list
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.580]   or onto your calendar.
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.300]   All right, so task board or list onto your calendar.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.620]   What would qualify it for going onto your calendar
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.100]   if it's connected to a specific day
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.820]   in which you've decided it needs to be executed?
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.700]   So the calendar is for time specific tasks.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.620]   So let's say I need to do a book blurb
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.480]   and it's due on Thursday,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.700]   I might put an all day event on that calendar day,
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.520]   you know, book blurb is due for whatever.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.260]   Oftentimes I'll actually find the specific time
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.780]   for one of these time sensitive activities
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.860]   and put it on my calendar like an appointment.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.940]   Give you a real world example,
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.220]   Friday of this week, department merit reviews are due.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.020]   It's a administrative task
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.300]   where you have to go through a spreadsheet
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.740]   and sort of fill in all the academic activities
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.580]   you did during the year
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.180]   and it helps generate your raise for the year.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.460]   I have the specific time when I'm gonna do that
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.720]   on my calendar for Friday.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.460]   So if a task is associated with a particular day,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.320]   it can go on your calendar,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.700]   it doesn't have to be on your task list
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.580]   because your calendar is obviously a productivity tool
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.860]   that you trust when you get to each day,
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.860]   you see what your appointments are and you do those things.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.500]   So I trust my calendar as a productivity tool.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.980]   If it's not tied to a specific day, it goes to a task list.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.180]   In my case, those lists are kept on Trello boards.
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.460]   Now I look at my Trello boards each morning
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.140]   when I build my daily time block plan.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.820]   So if you're actually following the system,
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.020]   if I actually am in the groove of looking at my task board
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.920]   every day when I do my weekly plan,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.480]   I can trust that stuff that's important will get done
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.240]   because when I look at the relevant task board,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.440]   I'll see those tasks
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.240]   and I'm not gonna be dumber tomorrow than I am today.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.120]   So if I know today this thing is important,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240]   when I see it tomorrow, I will remember,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   oh, this is important and see if I can fit it
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.400]   into my time block plan for the day.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.140]   So that is my best practice.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.520]   I sometimes don't follow it when I feel like my schedule
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.800]   is disrupted enough that I don't trust myself
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   to look at my task list every day
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080]   and that's when I begin adding an extra reminder
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.860]   to my weekly plan, emailing myself an email
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.720]   where it's a reminder in the subject line.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.160]   But that is all a,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.800]   that's all an artifact of lack of trust.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.920]   I don't trust that I'm gonna see this in my list
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.480]   and make sure it gets done.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.360]   That makes me nervous,
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.780]   so I'm gonna add these extra reminders.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.820]   But when I am on track,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.940]   executing my system properly,
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.040]   that's how I like to do it.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   If it needs to be done a particular day,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.480]   put it on that day, otherwise put it on the list.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.560]   Even if I know it needs to get done this week,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.740]   I don't really need to write that down somewhere
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.000]   because when I see that task in my list every single morning,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.440]   I will remember this is something
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.600]   that needs to get done this week.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.500]   Like I'm not gonna forget tomorrow what I know today.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.720]   So that's my best practice, calendar or task list,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.220]   check the task list every day.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.800]   That moves smoothly.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.820]   And that's how I know that I'm out of sorts by the way,
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.480]   is when I start emailing myself reminders,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.760]   that's when I step back and say, I'm off my system.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.120]   I need to get back to my system.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.920]   And I always feel better when I do.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.320]   - Do you do that process in like the same spot every day
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.640]   or is it vary?
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.480]   - I do now.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.360]   So in my study at home,
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.680]   which we'll have to in an upcoming weekly update video,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.060]   Jason's gonna bring the camera over to my study at home.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.840]   I go to my study at home each morning
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.620]   and I have a desk, my custom built desk
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.040]   that's made to fit the kind of weird space of the study.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.960]   And it has a one drawer.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.440]   I had it built in this one drawer
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.240]   and I open up that drawer and here's my time block planner.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.080]   I take that out, I put it on the desk,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   I turn on my laptop and it's the first thing I do
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.540]   is I'll make that daily plan for the day.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.800]   And I try to do this if I can
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.480]   before I walk my kids to the bus stop.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.320]   If not, immediately after I get back from the bus stop,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.400]   I'll do this by load up my computer.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160]   And so my weekly plan will be,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.440]   and I was looking to see if I don't have my backpack in here
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.760]   my weekly plan will be printed and in my time block planner.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.980]   So I open this thing, I read the weekly plan,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.400]   I open my computer, I read my calendar,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.600]   I read my task list in Trello
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.100]   and sketch out that time block plan for the day.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.040]   So when I'm on the ball, that's what I do.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.520]   And so having the set location
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.940]   that I come to every morning at the same time to do this,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.400]   that really has helped keep me in it.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.000]   So during the period when we were renovating that study
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.520]   and I didn't have a set location, I might work outside,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.920]   I might work at the kitchen table, I might work upstairs,
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.240]   I fell off the system more.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.120]   And so it's a good question.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.360]   Having a great location where this is where I do,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.200]   that's how I start my day
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.160]   has really made a big difference to me.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.800]   (upbeat music)
