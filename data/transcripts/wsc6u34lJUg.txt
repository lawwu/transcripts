[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.160]   two verses in the portion of Scripture that we read at the beginning, namely the thirty-seventh
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.760]   and the fortieth verses in the second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.180]   And they are the words, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" and also, "Save yourselves
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.400]   from this untoward generation."
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.100]   Now perhaps I'd better remind you of the whole setting.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.200]   Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.680]   the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.920]   Then Peter said unto them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.860]   Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.960]   For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off, even as many
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.040]   as the Lord our God shall call."
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.820]   And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save yourselves from this
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.440]   untoward generation."
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   Now, we are still at the beginning of the New Year.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.880]   I wonder how many of you still remember that and still think of that.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.160]   I was indicating here at Fortnight tonight, the first Sunday night of the New Year, that
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.400]   nothing is so characteristic of us all by nature as the way in which we just remember
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.080]   this whole matter of time and of our life in this world periodically.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.720]   New Year or something like that, but we soon forget it and we lapse back into the old position
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.200]   and into the old ways.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   And I think you will all agree that that is something which is true of most of us, if
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.620]   not indeed of all of us.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.480]   And so it is necessary that we should constantly be reminded of this.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.400]   Now we have been trying to do that during these Sunday evenings of this New Year.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.640]   We looked the first Sunday night at the whole brevity of life, the time past of our life
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.960]   and the little time that remains, the rest of our life.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.920]   We saw that we are living in a world in which that is true, that our lease on life is not
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   endless.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.520]   It is a very limited thing.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, that led on last Sunday to the next quite inevitable point.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.560]   What is indeed the whole future course of history?
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.920]   What is going to happen to the whole world and its peoples?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.460]   And there we were confronted by this great New Testament teaching and doctrine concerning
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.200]   the Second Coming of Christ, as it is called, the fact that he will come back into this
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.680]   world to judge it in righteousness, and that we should all take heed, lest that great event
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.960]   should take us unawares and come suddenly upon us, and we, being unprepared for it,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.200]   should go to disaster and to final calamity.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   Well, now I am continuing that same theme this evening, and I want to put it to you
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.000]   like this.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.240]   In our world, as it is this evening, this world of the bombs, this world of the dread
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.680]   possibility of some mighty cataclysm taking place at any momentâ€”I remind you again how
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.120]   it is the scientists who are telling us that by about 1968 some twelve nations will have
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.800]   these bombs, and thereby the risk of any one of them mishandling them or misusing them
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   is correspondingly increased.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.760]   Well, there is our world, there is our setting.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.360]   The whole situation has become so uncertain, and that is not merely the Bible saying it
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.520]   any longer, but it is indeed secular men, men who do not claim to be Christians, but
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.680]   who are speaking from a strictly scientific standpoint, and who remind us that the end
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.040]   may come upon us almost at any moment.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now the question I am asking is this.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.760]   What then is our first duty in the light of this?
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:41.840]   What is the first thing that we should do face to face with such terrible possibilities?
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.520]   And my argument is this, that the first thing that we should say by way of reaction to these
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.240]   circumstances is the very thing that was said by these people who were listening to the
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.440]   preaching of the Apostle Peter at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.800]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.240]   Now I am saying that this is the logical step.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   With the world as it is, with all these uncertainties and possibilities, isn't that obviously the
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.040]   first thing that we should ask, the first thing we should say?
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.920]   What then are we to do in the light of this situation?
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.560]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.160]   What shall we do, as it were, to save ourselves out of this condition in which we find ourselves?
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.320]   Well now, I want to consider with you this morning, this evening, a reaction which is
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.400]   very common at the present time to that very statement.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   And it is this.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.960]   There are many who would say that to react in that way, to be concerned about our souls
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.520]   and their salvation, about our own deliverance, is just to be unutterably selfish.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.160]   "Fancy," they say, "with the world as it is this evening, and with the nations going
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.760]   along the lines along which they are traveling, fancy with the whole world in this predicament
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.720]   that you should exhort people to be concerned about themselves and their own personal salvation."
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.160]   They say, "If that's your Christianity, we've no use for it at all."
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.920]   Surely, they say, the business of Christianity is to be concerned about the whole world.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   What are we that we should look at ourselves and say, "How can I be saved and my soul
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.400]   be saved," when the whole world is, as it were, in this condition?
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.520]   "Isn't it your business," they say, "as Christians, not only to be concerned about
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.480]   this larger issue, but to be doing everything you can to deal with it?"
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.120]   They say, "It is really despicable that anybody at a time such as this should put
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.240]   up as his first question, 'What about my soul?
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.600]   How can I make sure that I am all right myself?'"
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.640]   Now, that, I think you will agree, is a very common attitude that is taken by large numbers
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.320]   of people at this present time, and obviously it's a very vital matter.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.480]   Now, let's approach it like this.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.880]   Have you personally ever asked this question, "What shall I do?"
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.240]   Have you ever so realized your position in this life and in this world that you've
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.520]   become concerned about your present position and about your future position?
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.820]   Has anything ever happened to you that has brought you to the point and to the place
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.640]   which these people came to, and made them interrupt the sermon, as it were, and cry
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   out, saying, "What shall we do then?"
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.720]   In the light of what you're saying, "What shall we do?"
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:53.000]   They became tremendously concerned about themselves and about their own personal position.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.880]   I'm simply asking, have you ever asked the question, "If not, why not?
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.120]   Is it, I wonder, because you hold that view, that there is something very small and selfish
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.880]   about this, that it is wrong for us to have this concern about our own personal salvation
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.000]   with the world in its present state and predicament?"
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.840]   Well, now, then, I want to try to show you that that attitude is not only wrong, but
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.480]   that it is the most dangerous attitude in which one can ever find oneself.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.360]   Now let me approach it like this.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   First and foremost, let me make this perfectly clear.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.080]   The evangelical preaching of this Gospel does not tell people to be only concerned about
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.400]   their souls and their personal salvation.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.600]   But what it does do is to tell them to be, first of all, concerned about this.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.960]   There is nothing that I find in the Scripture which tells a man to be only concerned about
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.280]   himself, and to pull down the blinds, as it were, and to ignore the great world which
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.000]   is round and about him.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.640]   That's not Christianity.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.600]   That is not evangelical Christianity.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.560]   But what is evangelical Christianity is, as I say, that you must start with this, and
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.400]   that if you are concerned about the generalities without having, first of all, made certain
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.920]   about yourself, that you are not only wrong, but that you are a fool, and that you are
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.980]   jeopardizing your most vital interests.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:28.880]   Not only this, but definitely this first, and after this, the various other matters.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.040]   It's the same kind of order as our Lord indicates Himself, you remember, in the famous
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.240]   words, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these other
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.400]   things shall be added unto you."
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.120]   You don't start with them, you seek with the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.640]   then these other things.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.720]   And so it is with Christianity.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.040]   Christianity is not first a general interest, and only a general interest, it is first a
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.200]   personal interest.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.520]   And that, in turn, leads on to the more general interests.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.400]   And of course, this is what has been true historically throughout the running centuries.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.480]   Actually, history shows this very plainly, that the people who have been the greatest
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:18.000]   benefactors to life in this world have been those who have first of all made sure of their
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   own personal salvation.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.720]   Now that's a statement which I could very easily prove and substantiate.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   The greatest blessings we are all enjoying tonight have come ultimately through the medium
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.160]   of the Christian Church and through Christian leaders.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.800]   It is certain men who themselves had seen their own lost estate and who became Christian
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.600]   who then began to consider the lot and the condition of others.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.400]   Think of your factory acts.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   Where did they come from?
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.600]   Well, they came from the conversion of Lord Shaftesbury himself.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.780]   It was when he himself got right with God and his soul was saved that he developed the
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.040]   interest in the others.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.240]   What about slavery?
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.640]   Have you read the story of Samuel Wilberforce and the whole question of slavery?
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.200]   Why did that man become concerned about the liberation of slaves?
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.720]   And the answer, quite simply, is this, that it was after he himself had experienced his
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   personal salvation.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.080]   He was a typical society man before that, a very clever, a very brilliant and a very
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.200]   wealthy man, and he was enjoying the so-called life of society.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.360]   He wasn't interested in slaves, not at all concerned about them.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.240]   But when he first of all became concerned about his own soul and saw his own lost condition
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.160]   and then got right with God in Christ, he became aware of the problem of others.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:56.680]   And so it has been with practically every beneficent institution that the world of men
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.440]   is enjoying this evening.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.040]   Education, hospitals, all these things have always come in the wake of mighty religious
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.320]   movements and revivals which have led people to a concern about their own personal soul
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   salvation.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.980]   Now, that's a general answer.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.120]   So this glib talk, you see, about it being selfish, that a man should be concerned about
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.020]   his own soul, is so altogether wrong.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.000]   The only people who do become really concerned about others are those who've got this new
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.520]   life, because until you have it, well, you're selfish.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.960]   The natural man is always selfish.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.000]   That's why the world is so selfish tonight, because it's not Christian.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.920]   Everybody's looking after himself and his own interests.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.960]   There's much less kindness in the world as it becomes less and less religious.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.080]   Everybody's out for himself and only interested in himself.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.720]   Let the others fend for themselves.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.880]   The more Christian your society, the greater its concern for one another.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.280]   Now, that's a pure statement of history.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.600]   However, let's leave that at that and let me come to the most specifically Christian
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   arguments.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   Here is the first.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.720]   Why should I be first and foremost concerned that my own soul is right and is saved in
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   the world as it is this evening?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.840]   Well, here is my first answer.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.400]   It is always the thing that is put first in the Scripture itself.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.320]   It is the thing that you always find first in the New Testament.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.600]   Now, it's so easy to talk in generalities, isn't it?
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.580]   But go and read your New Testament.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:40.300]   And if you do so, I suggest you'll come to this conclusion, that the New Testament teaching
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.360]   is always personal.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.920]   It's always addressed directly to the individual.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.560]   You see, the word in the Bible is always this word, "whosoever."
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.680]   We've already had it in our reading tonight.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.680]   Whosoever.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.200]   The individual.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.240]   Any individual.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.880]   Any person.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.120]   That's always the biblical teaching.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   It is invariably concerned, not with general positions, but with the case and the condition
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.920]   of individual people.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.640]   In other words, you're constantly finding the phrase that is here and everywhere else,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.440]   "every one of you."
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.760]   Not all, but every one of you.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.720]   Now, this is a point that I could easily develop.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.000]   I must refrain from doing so this evening and resist the temptation to do so.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.760]   One of the greatest troubles in the modern world is this mass and mob mentality.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.280]   Crowds, large numbers, the individual is being forgotten.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:50.960]   He's just a cog in a wheel, just a cipher, just a patient number of a bed in a ward.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.800]   Individuality is rapidly disappearing and everything is taken in the mass and in great
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.960]   crowds and in the main.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.800]   But you know, the Bible does the exact opposite, as I'm going to show you.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.680]   The Bible is always interested in us one by one.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.160]   Now take it, start with the preaching of John the Baptist, the first preacher in the New
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   Testament.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.160]   He starts off.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160]   What's his message?
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.520]   "Repent," he says, "every one of you."
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:16.040]   "Who has warned you?" he says, looking at certain individuals, "to flee from the wrath
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.920]   to come."
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.200]   John the Baptist wasn't preaching a general message about world reform or world improvement.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.480]   He was facing men and women, standing there, listening to him and said, "Now, what about
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   your life?
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   What are you doing about it?"
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.600]   He took the different groups and he addressed them one by one, and he was concerned about
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   them as individuals.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   "Repent," and that's an individual action.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.160]   Now there's your first preacher.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.960]   He brings it down at once to the personal individual.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   Take our Lord's preaching.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.000]   He's the second preacher.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.800]   He does exactly the same thing, "Repent, every one of you, and believe the gospel."
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.680]   All our Lord's teachings, read these gospels for yourselves.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.440]   He was always talking to individuals.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:08.400]   Talks to a woman ill for years, talks to another woman bent, talks to a poor boy possessed
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.760]   of devils, always addressing individuals.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.680]   And when he's addressing a crowd of people, his message is always and invariably to the
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.800]   individual.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.000]   He was always talking to people about their individual souls and about their individual
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.880]   relationship to God.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.720]   I defy you to find anything beyond that in his teaching.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.600]   He was always concerned with the individual.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.400]   And the apostles, when you come here to the Book of Acts, you find, of course, doing exactly
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   the same thing.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.520]   Here is the first sermon ever really preached under the auspices of the Christian judge,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.200]   the apostle Peter, on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   What did he preach about?
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.960]   Did he preach about world affairs, world conditions?
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.240]   This country was conquered at that moment, you remember, by the great Roman Empire.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.000]   Did he mention it?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.640]   Is there any indication given here at all that he was even interested in it?
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.480]   What was he concerned about?
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.360]   General positions, large issues, great world affairs?
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   Not at all.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.520]   He looked at these people and he said, "Now look here, you, you yourselves, you are the
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.520]   crowd who were a few weeks ago, were crying about this Jesus of whom I'm speaking.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.480]   You were the people who were shouting, 'Away with him, crucify him.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.280]   We are not interested, we have nothing to do with him.'
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   You were doing it.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.120]   You and your rulers," he said, "you were the people who have done this."
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.400]   And you know, they knew he was speaking to them personally, so they cried out, "Men
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.960]   and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.720]   Not what shall we do to reform the world, not what shall we do to rid our own country
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.480]   of the Roman domination.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.400]   What shall we do about this guilt in which we find ourselves, the way we treated that
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   Jesus of whom you are speaking?"
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.320]   It was intensely and directly individual.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.000]   And of course, Peter replies to them and makes it perfectly clear in his preaching that that
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.820]   is what he is concerned about.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:07.120]   With many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save yourselves from this untoward
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   generation."
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.280]   He doesn't say, "Rise up and reform the generation."
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.280]   He says, "No, no."
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.960]   He says, "Things being as they are, save yourselves out of it, from it."
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.440]   It's personal and entirely personal.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.680]   And as you go right through your New Testament, you will find invariably always precisely
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   the same thing.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.040]   Well, if I've got no other reason, that's enough for me.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.000]   My business is to expand this book, not to say what I think.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.720]   And here I find a book that is all along talking to me individually and personally, and addressing
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:47.400]   me and holding me in a certain position, and bringing me to this point in which I see myself
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:53.800]   in trouble and in difficulties, and I cry out, saying, "What shall I do?"
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.040]   That's the first great and grand reason.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:04.720]   It is a travesty of the New Testament teaching to minimize this emphasis upon the individual
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.560]   and the personal, and to put it entirely on the general.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.440]   But come, let us find some other reasons.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.760]   The second is this.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.920]   Why should I be concerned about myself and about my salvation?
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:24.320]   The answer is the supreme value of the soul and its relationship to God.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.280]   Now, of course, I know that this argument, that this interest in personal salvation is
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.120]   selfish and narrow and so on, I know it's a very specious argument.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.320]   It doesn't stand examination for a second.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:46.680]   Because you see, in every other respect, practically, in life we all are concerned about ourselves.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.320]   You get annoyed with a man who's concerned about his own health?
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.280]   You know somebody tonight who's got an illness, and there he is, he's concerned about it.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.880]   He wants to get well, of course.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.320]   Now, why don't you go to him and say, "Look here, my friend, with these bombs being made,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.680]   you know, and the condition of the world as it is tonight, this is no time for you to
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   be thinking about your own personal health.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   Forget it, men.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.120]   Go and talk about the world and put the world right.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   Deal with the big situation.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   Why?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.400]   Look at your utter selfishness.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.440]   You're concerned about your health, just one individual, and you're thinking about your
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.760]   own health and how you can be put in order.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   How utterly selfish.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760]   Do we do that?
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.920]   Of course we don't.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.560]   We don't do it about our health.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.520]   We don't do it about our wealth.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.080]   We don't do it about our happiness.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.640]   I know there are many people in this congregation now who say, "Oh, this evangelical preaching,
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.840]   it's personal, so selfish, salvation of your own soul."
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.280]   Yes, but my dear young men, don't you think you're being a little bit selfish in thinking
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.800]   about getting married yourself and paying attention to one particular girl?
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.760]   You know that's a very selfish thing to do with the world as it is tonight, isn't it?
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.120]   Why should you be thinking of you are getting married and having a home and a family and
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.280]   looking forward to life?
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.440]   In a time like this, with the whole world ready to explode at the moment, you are thinking
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.840]   about getting married yourself.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.720]   You don't argue like that, do you?
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.560]   No, no, of course we don't.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.760]   We don't argue like that about health, health of the body.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.080]   We don't argue like that about the health of the psyche, the soul, whatever you may
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   like to call it.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.840]   We don't argue like that about our own individual prosperity and happiness.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.720]   No, no, we say a man's got to live his own life after all, and I want to be right in
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.880]   these respects, and of course you're absolutely right.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.920]   Well then, why don't you follow your own logic?
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.200]   Why do you suddenly change when it comes to the question of the soul?
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.440]   Why should it be such a terrible thing for a man to be concerned about his own soul and
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.640]   his soul's salvation?
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.880]   The argument, I say, won't stand examination for a second.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.400]   My dear friend, the truth is the other way around.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.960]   If there is one thing that we should be concerned about above everything else, it is the soul.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   Why?
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.280]   Well, because the soul is the greatest thing that is in us.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.700]   The soul is greater than the body.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.760]   You remember how our Lord works that out in the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.120]   He says, "You people, you know, you're very interested in what you shall put on,
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.080]   you're very interested in what you shall eat and what you shall drink, but you're
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.320]   not concerned about these other matters.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.400]   The soul, the life, the man, the entity, is bigger and is greater than the body."
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   Why?
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.280]   Well, for these good reasons.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.500]   It is, I say, the greatest thing in men.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.520]   It is the soul that differentiates men from all the animals.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.960]   It is the soul in men that is that part of that image that God has put upon him.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.120]   Man has been made in the image of God, and that is the image, in a sense, the thing we
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.080]   call the soul, this immaterial part of man, this thing that God put into him when he breathed
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.800]   into him the breath of life and when he said, "Let us make him in our own image and likeness."
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.120]   This is the soul.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:19.760]   It's the most important thing about us, because here, you see, is the thing whereby we are
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.400]   related to God himself.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.120]   Now, I'm not depreciating the value of the body.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.360]   Of course not.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.960]   Christianity doesn't do that.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.400]   The body is important.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.000]   We should pay attention to the body.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.640]   We should try to have a healthy body.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.320]   We should go out of our way to be careful in this respect.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.760]   We should avoid all excesses.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.160]   We should try to keep the rules.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.520]   The body is a gift of God.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   Let's honor it.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.960]   Let's keep it as pure and as healthy as we can.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:50.320]   Yes, but I say, go up the scale, body, soul, spirit.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.160]   And there's no question as to which is the most important.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:00.460]   It is this immaterial part of man that lifts him up above the whole of creation, that makes
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.280]   him the Lord of creation.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.420]   The mind, the understanding, the sensibility, and all this that is meant for God and has
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.840]   been put into us by God.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   That is the soul.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.440]   Now, there's nothing to compare with that.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.780]   And therefore, the Bible teaches us everywhere that as man is concerned about his body and
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.320]   its well-being and his social well-being and so on, he should above everything be concerned
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.120]   about the well-being of his soul.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.120]   Why?
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.760]   Well, here is an inadequate reason, surely, and we need seek nothing further.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.040]   Here is the only thing in us that goes on.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.440]   The body is going to die and disintegrate.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.320]   Dust to dust, earth to earth, ashes to ashes.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.840]   Oh, it's going to happen to every one of us.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.920]   It's bound to happen.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   The body is only temporary.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.360]   The Bible says this is a sort of tent.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.520]   The apostle Peter and old men, the same men who was preaching here at the end of his life,
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.080]   he turned to the people and he said, "You know, as long as I'm in this tabernacle, I'm
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.120]   going to go on reminding you of these things."
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.680]   That's what the body is.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   It's a sort of tent in which we live while we're in this world.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.400]   We know perfectly well it's going to go.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   It's going to disintegrate.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   It's going to fall apart.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   But, you know, when the tent has gone, I go on, my soul goes on.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.000]   It's the imperishable thing.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.680]   It's in every respect the greatest thing of all about men.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   Well, very well.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:30.280]   If the soul is the greatest thing, we should show the greatest concern about it.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.600]   And what should we be concerned about?
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:39.040]   Well, we should be concerned about this, the health of the soul, the well-being of the
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.560]   soul, my soul in its relationship to God.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.680]   Oh, yes, ask your question, is my body functioning properly?
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   Is there disease or defect?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   Deal with it.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.120]   Apply the same to the soul.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   What of my soul?
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.040]   Do I know God?
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.080]   Do I have converse with God?
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.840]   Is my soul functioning?
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.400]   Am I living as a man or only as an animal?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.200]   What about this higher part of me?
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Is it awake?
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   Is it alert?
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   Is it alive?
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.240]   Is it doing its work and its business?
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.880]   What about it when I come to shake off this mortal coil?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.080]   Fold up the tent, call it what you like.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.440]   Make my coitus, make my exodus.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.720]   We've all got to do it.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   What then?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   What about this soul?
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.920]   Well, I needn't keep you.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.840]   Our Lord himself has put this in a final word.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.000]   Once and forever listen to him.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.720]   Finally he says, "What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.200]   own soul?"
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.080]   You may gain the whole world of wealth.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.560]   You may gain the whole world of knowledge and of influence and of position.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.080]   You may have it all.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.800]   Finally he says, "What shall it profit a man if he's got all that?"
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   Why?
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.760]   Well, you see, for this reason that the day is bound to come when he's got to leave all
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.520]   that behind and his soul goes on.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.280]   So what shall it profit him if he's gained all that and lose his own soul?
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.140]   Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul at the bar of judgment when God will
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.120]   ask him the question, "There's nothing."
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.680]   Oh, my dear friend, follow your own logic as you're concerned about the health and well-being
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   of body, social connections, and so on.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.880]   Lift it up, I say, the soul, the supreme thing.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   Start with that.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   Start with the greatest thing.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.400]   Come down the ladder instead of doing the reverse.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.160]   Very well, there's my second reason.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.920]   But let me hurry to a third reason.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:47.460]   God will hold us individually responsible for ourselves.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.260]   There is no question about this.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.700]   This is biblical teaching from beginning to end.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.800]   So whether you're interested in your soul or not, there's a day coming when you'll have
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.980]   to be.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.080]   Because God having given you the gift, he's going to call you to account.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.780]   Now our Lord put that once in a parable of the talents, you remember.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.520]   He pictured a king giving talents to certain people and then he went far away and didn't
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.600]   come back for a long time, but he did come back and he said, "What have you made of the
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.360]   talent that I gave you?"
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.120]   There was a man who said, "I did nothing with it.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.160]   I buried it and put it out of sight.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   Done nothing with it."
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.080]   And he's the man who's turned out, you remember, and condemned.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.400]   Well now that is the biblical teaching everywhere.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.120]   I come back to it once more this evening and in this world as it is tonight, oh, that we
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.000]   all may be alive to this.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   We must all appear, every one of us, before the judgment seat of Christ.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.600]   Every one of us.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:48.560]   And give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.360]   We'll all have to pass through that straight gate, you know, that turnstile.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   You don't go in crowds to face God, you go through a turnstile.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.440]   Because we came through a turnstile into this world, didn't we?
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.680]   We were not born in crowds.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.560]   Do you know man isn't mass produced?
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.960]   Try to remember that in a world that is thinking of everything in terms of mass production.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.920]   No man is mass produced, one by one.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.760]   You came into the world, into life, through a turnstile.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   And you'll go out of it through a turnstile.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.080]   The turnstile of death.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.520]   We don't die in crowds.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.000]   We don't die in great companies.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   No, no.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.400]   You can watch football in a great crowd, but you won't die in a crowd.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.840]   You'll die alone.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.400]   Even though it be the last explosion, we'll die individually.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.480]   Every one of us.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.560]   We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560]   Or listen to another word.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:48.360]   Every man, we are told, shall bear his own burden.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   Every man shall bear his own burden.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.480]   Listen to this, the Apostle Paul putting it to the Romans.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.920]   But why dost thou judge thy brother, or why dost thou set up not thy brother?
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.480]   For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:14.200]   So then, he says, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.400]   Now this is the thing, of course, that is being forgotten today.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.860]   I don't find a single teaching in the Bible that tells us that any one of us is to be
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.960]   held responsible for the state of the world.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   Not one.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.480]   But I shall be held responsible for what I've done with my own soul.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.880]   I'm not responsible for the government of this country.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.640]   I have my delegated responsibility in a sense as a citizen.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   We all have it.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.280]   But I'm not ultimately responsible.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:48.080]   But here I am responsible for myself, my soul, my life, what I've done, and what I haven't
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.080]   done.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.240]   I shall be asked to give an account of myself.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.840]   And what I myself have done in the body which God has given me.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.640]   That is the position of every one of us.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.480]   So I say that there is another reason for this concern, which makes a man cry out and
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.920]   say, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.680]   I've got this precious gift, and I shall be asked what I've done with it, what I've made
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   of it."
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   And the question is, "What have I done?"
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   I must start with this, but let me come to a still more cogent reason.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.040]   Why should I start with this question of my soul and my own personal salvation?
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.720]   Well, here's an answer.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:41.200]   This is the only thing in this world that really can be put right.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.800]   Now then, do you accept that?
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.360]   You agree about that?
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.760]   Why should I start with my soul rather than with the whole world situation?
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.120]   Here's my answer.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.880]   My soul can be put right.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.760]   And it is the only thing that can be put right.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:09.120]   Now, I mustn't repeat what I think I argued adequately and conclusively last Sunday night.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.040]   I just repeat the argument in this form.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.640]   The world cannot be put right.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.880]   I'm going further.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.160]   The world never will be put right.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.200]   But you say, "You're a Christian, and you speak like that."
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.640]   It is because I am a Christian I do speak like that.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.240]   It is the non-Christians who believe the world can be put right, and it cannot be put right.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.000]   They've been trying for centuries.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.520]   They're no nearer, they seem to be further.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.080]   You'll never put the world right.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.200]   Our Lord says so.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.160]   The world is under condemnation.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.120]   It is under the wrath of God.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.200]   Christ is going to come back to judge it and to condemn it and to cast it to perdition.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.640]   The world will never be put right.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.360]   It cannot be put right.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.160]   But the individual soul can be put right.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.800]   Now, this is the gospel.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.560]   This is exactly the peculiar and the special message of this Christian gospel.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.760]   Peter puts it here in a nutshell, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:22.960]   "Save yourselves out of the world and its doom and its coming disaster."
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.480]   Now that is the great message.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.760]   The Apostle Paul writes to the Galatians and he says, "Blessed be the God and the Father
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:38.600]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who hath delivered us out of this present evil world."
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   That's it.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.800]   He writes to the Thessalonians and he says the same thing.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:50.360]   He says that we believe and wait for the appearing of his Son Jesus, who hath delivered us from
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.160]   the wrath to come.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.200]   You see, this is the great message of this book, that the world is under this doom and
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.600]   condemnation.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.880]   The world is evil.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.600]   It belongs to the devil.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.280]   There is not a scintilla of evidence to support the contention that Christianity's message
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.040]   is world reform, world improvement, to save the world from calamity.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.240]   It cannot be done.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.320]   The world is already doomed.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.680]   But my dear friend, you and I can be saved out of that doom.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.600]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:26.240]   Save yourselves out of, from this untoward generation.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.120]   Flee from the wrath to come.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.040]   Here is a glorious possibility.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:39.360]   And that is why I know of nothing which is so tragic tonight as this foolish argument
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.040]   of men and women who say, "But you're utterly selfish in being concerned about your own
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.120]   personal soul's salvation with the world as it is tonight."
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.360]   "Forget yourself, men," they say.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.720]   "Don't be interested in your own soul and its salvage.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.080]   Try and save the world from the calamity that's coming."
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.200]   Why do I say it is of all the foolish positions the most foolish?
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.600]   Well, here's my answer.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.280]   You can go on doing that other thing as long as you like.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.720]   You'll never succeed.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.280]   But if you've given the whole of your time to doing that, and you've ignored entirely
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.320]   the question of your own personal soul's salvation, do you know what's going to happen to you?
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   I'll tell you.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.400]   It's one of two things.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.520]   One is this.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.400]   You may die tonight, or you may die tomorrow night, or you may die at any moment.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.680]   And still the world hasn't been put right.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.760]   But then what of you?
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.760]   You've been laboring and given all your energy to try to save the world from the calamity,
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.960]   and to try to reform it and put it in order, and to save it, thinking that that's Christianity.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.080]   But suddenly you'll be confronted with God, who will ask you, "What have you done about
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.240]   the soul that I gave you?"
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.640]   But you say, "I did a lot of good.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.160]   I tried to reform the world."
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.320]   The answer will be, "That isn't the question I'm asking you."
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.760]   What about your relationship to me?
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.960]   What about my commandments?
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.800]   What did you do with the soul?
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   How did you exercise it?
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.400]   How did you enjoy a relationship with me?
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.360]   I sent my only son into the world to die for the sins of men.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.200]   How did that come into your calculation?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   Where did it come in?
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.120]   And you say, "But I thought that was selfish.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.880]   I was here to save the world."
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   And the answer will be, "You are responsible for your soul and for nothing else."
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.800]   Is there anything so mad?
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.300]   If it isn't that, it'll be this.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.160]   You may be alive in this world when the end does come, however it may come.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.960]   Whether the explosion of the bomb or some other method, I don't know.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.120]   But let's assume you're here, you're still here, and the end suddenly comes, and you
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.240]   realize at last what a fool you've been.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.880]   You spent the whole of your time in trying to stop that end coming, but it's come.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.280]   And then you'll realize that you're face to face with the personal question and your
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:05.840]   own personal responsibility for your own soul.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.120]   And you've never given it a thought.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   You thought that was selfish, that was small.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:15.520]   Oh, how the devil blinds and deludes men and women.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.720]   Why not face practical politics?
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.640]   Why not be a realist?
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.080]   And there are the facts, and there's nothing to add to them.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.680]   The world is doomed.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.400]   It is under condemnation.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.440]   It's surely proving it before our eyes today.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.520]   We are facing doom, according to the very scientists.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.840]   We are hurtling ourselves in that direction.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.960]   And even while this is happening, you know, it is possible for you as an individual to
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.920]   be saved out of it.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.240]   It is possible for your individual soul to be delivered.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.680]   You can be dissociated from the doom of that world.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.880]   You can be reconciled to God.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.840]   Your soul can be renewed.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.440]   You can be delivered from sin in its power and in its pollution, as well as in its guilt.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.780]   Your soul can be put right as it ought to be.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.760]   This is an actual possibility this evening.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:16.440]   Is there anything more mad than for men to attempt impossibilities and to refuse the
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.040]   only possibility?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.560]   This is the thing that is offered in the New Testament.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.240]   The urgency is obvious.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:28.320]   It's not surprising these men cried out, saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.360]   They say, 'We see it.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   We see the guilt.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   We see the folly.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   What shall we do?
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   Where shall we turn?'"
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:41.200]   Don't we see something of the same urgency at this present time?
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.600]   Why not listen to the signs of the times?
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.080]   Why not see that the time is short at best?
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   Life is short.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.240]   The whole time of the whole world may be very short indeed.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.600]   I don't know.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.920]   It may or it may not be.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.640]   But whether it is or not, I know that my time is short.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.760]   The rest of my time is a very little rest.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.440]   And here is this possibility.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   What is it?
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:19.120]   Oh, this is the first thing that every sensible, logical, reasoning man or woman should consider
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   this evening.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.360]   My dear friend, if you haven't faced this, I have nothing to say except that you're a
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   fool.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   The facts are inevitable.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   You can't evade them.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   You can't avoid them.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.000]   Very well, then, your first question should be this.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.400]   What can I do about this soul of mine?
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.600]   I see that I can't change the world and save it.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   What about my own soul?
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.440]   Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.760]   There's only one answer.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.080]   It is the answer that was given to those people who asked the question on the day of Pentecost
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   at Jerusalem.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:03.000]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.560]   You notice, every one of you.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.360]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   Repentance is individual.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.360]   Baptism is individual.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:19.480]   And be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.760]   And ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.240]   That's all.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:34.280]   This astounding, amazing, apparently incredible thing, but it's nevertheless the heart and
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.200]   the message of the gospel.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.480]   Here's the first sermon.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.280]   Here's the first preacher in the Christian church.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   That's what he says.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.560]   That's what he's been talking about.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.080]   He's been preaching about Jesus Christ, this Jesus of Nazareth, this man who walked back
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.760]   and forth in that country, who'd been a few weeks before in Jerusalem.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.920]   They'd cried away with him, "Crucify him.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   We don't want him.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.560]   Caesar is our king."
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.720]   And he'd been crucified and had died and had been buried, but he'd risen again.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:08.400]   "Oh," says Peter, "you didn't realize it, but you were killing and crucifying your own
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.720]   Savior.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.760]   You were putting to death your own Deliverer.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:18.440]   You were turning your backs upon and execrating and blaspheming the Son of God who'd come
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.880]   into this world in order to what?
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   Well, to save you.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.440]   The thing you're asking for now.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.440]   What shall we do?
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.080]   Well, there's only one thing to do.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.800]   Realize the awful calamity of your mistake.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.400]   Repent.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.680]   Think again.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   Change your mind.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.440]   Confess that you were wrong."
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.640]   That's what repentance means.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.920]   It means thinking again.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.760]   It means changing your mind.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:53.640]   "Oh, my dear friend, may I plead with you urgently this evening to think again?
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.080]   Think about your soul.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   Think about yourself.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:04.840]   Follow your own logic, health, body, affairs, happiness, soul, spirit, God, eternity.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   Think about it.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.240]   Have you ever thought about it?
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.360]   You've dismissed it as being selfish, haven't you?
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.800]   Fancy thinking about my own soul salvation with the world as it is.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.280]   Never say that again.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.600]   Follow your own logic.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.600]   Be reasonable.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.040]   Say, 'I must start with this.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.520]   I'll think again.'
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:27.920]   And then you'll soon begin to see how foolish you've been.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:34.600]   In all your cleverness, you'll see how illogical you've been, how inconsistent you've been.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.920]   You'll see that you've ignored the greatest thing of all, that you've ignored God and
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.760]   your relationship to Him.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.920]   You'll see that you've ignored the purity of your soul, the life of God, the life of
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.160]   purity and holiness that is possible even in this world.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.560]   You'll see that you've done nothing with Christ, Son of God, who came and died for you.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.880]   He's never entered into your calculations.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.440]   Like the people in Jerusalem, you'll have to admit and confess that you've turned your
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   back upon Him and ignored Him, and given yourself to other people and other things.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.880]   Repent, says Peter.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.000]   And it means that you not only think again and change your mind, it means that you go
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.800]   to God and to Christ and tell them that.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.480]   You go to God and say, 'God, I see what a fool I've been.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.840]   I've neglected the greatest gift that you've given me.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.240]   I've exalted other gifts and put them first, and I've ignored Thine.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.360]   I've been trying to win the whole world and have forgotten and lost my own soul.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.640]   God, can you still look at me?
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.920]   Have mercy upon me.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   Take me back.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.800]   What can I do?'
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   That's repentance.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.320]   You go to God and you acknowledge your folly and your sin and your shame, and you say the
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.880]   same to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.960]   You admit it all.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   You confess it all.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   You don't try to defend yourself.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.400]   And you cast yourself upon God's mercy.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:04.120]   And as you do so, He will tell you the very thing that Peter told these people at Jerusalem.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:10.920]   'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.760]   He rose from the dead.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.520]   This isn't David, it's greater.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.760]   David said, 'My Lord, yes, He's Son of God.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.440]   He's conquered death and the grave.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.120]   He is the Deliverer, and He can deliver you.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.200]   Believe on Him.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.960]   Be baptized into His name,' which means that you leave the world, you give yourself and
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.560]   your life to Him, and you live only for Him henceforward.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.880]   Be baptized, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.320]   That's all you've got to do.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:47.360]   And you see, then if you do that, this is the marvellous thing that happens, that you
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   are delivered immediately from this untoward generation.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:45:00.800]   You are delivered from the doom to which the world is hastening.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:09.640]   And then, if the end should come by death on your own, or in the final cataclysm, it
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.160]   won't affect you.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.000]   You will have already passed through judgment into life.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.040]   You will be absolutely safe.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.720]   Christ came to save our individual souls.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.840]   He saves all who believe in Him.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.240]   All who repent and believe in Him are saved.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.240]   That's all, says Peter.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:41.840]   Repent, be baptized in His name, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.920]   And it's as true tonight as it was nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.720]   Oh, be wise.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.080]   Realize the whole state of the world as it is at this hour.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.320]   The first thing to make sure of is that whatever happens, you are ready, you are right, your
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.000]   soul is everlastingly saved.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.600]   And once you've put that right, then you can, if you like, pay attention to the world.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.520]   Try and make it as good a world as you can.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.000]   Go into politics if you like, go into your local council, go and do anything you like.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.080]   I don't care what it is, but if you do all that without saving your soul, you'll find
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.920]   yourself at the end with the world lost and you lost with it.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:34.400]   Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.840]   And then, and only then, do your best and your utmost for the world while you're still
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.920]   in it, and while it still lasts, but above everything.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:56.400]   Make certain, make sure that your soul is saved safe.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:05.720]   And you do so by repenting and believing that Christ, the Son of God, has died for your
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   sins.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:17.240]   To reconcile you to God and that he will save your soul, give you a new life and a new hope,
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:24.080]   and will lead you to the end and present you faultless in the presence of God in glory,
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:36.840]   with exceeding joy, safe in the arms of Jesus, safe on his gentle breast.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:51.000]   When the world is shaken and finally destroyed, you will be safe in the arms of Jesus.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:02.560]   Be wise, think, start with the soul, your personal soul, and make certain that you are
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:09.240]   in Christ and eternally safe.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.480]   Amen.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:16.400]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
