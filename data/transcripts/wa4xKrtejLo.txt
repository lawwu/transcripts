[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.560]   All right.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.080]   So we have a question here now from Nana, who says,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   how do I apply deep work to my life?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.700]   I am a student.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.720]   I have a full-time job and a business.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.880]   Well, I think it's a good question because it, again,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.280]   gets to an issue that I think we come across often, which
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.480]   is that the meaning of deep work can metamorphosize,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.640]   for some people, into something bigger,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   into some sort of image of life that seems unattainable,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.160]   some sort of image of I spend my winters at my cabin
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.800]   with the wood-burning stove going
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.480]   as I sit with my moleskin and a quill from an eagle that
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840]   was killed on George Washington's property
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.400]   in the colonial period and has been passed down
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.280]   through generations.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.320]   And I stare into the flames before every 30 or 40 minutes
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.880]   writing one well-crafted sentence.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.040]   And then I have a sip of bourbon, and this is what I do.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.240]   Sometimes deep work gets translated
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.520]   into a crazy image of a life that is depth to the extreme.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.560]   And then you say, well, I can't do that.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.200]   I'm a student.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.840]   I have a job.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.000]   I'm trying to run a business on the side.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.480]   I can't be at a cabin looking into the fire
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.360]   with a quill from George Washington's property
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360]   drinking bourbon, right?
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.440]   OK, but let's get more specific, and I
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.600]   think we can start to make some progress here.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.880]   All deep work really is is a particular type of way
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.960]   you can work on something.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600]   It's an approach to working on something
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.880]   where you don't context shift.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   You just focus on the thing you're working on
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.200]   and give it your full concentration.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840]   And you do it for a non-trivial amount of time
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.140]   without checking email, without looking at your phone,
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.720]   without looking at your web browser.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.160]   The idea is if you give something your full attention
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.320]   without context shifting, you get much better results.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.560]   You get the results faster.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.200]   And then therefore, this is the main argument
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.840]   of the book, Deep Work, is you should prioritize that
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.400]   and make sure that during your work, whatever your work is,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.960]   during your work hours, whenever your work hours happen to be,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.800]   don't just call all work work.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.720]   Say, well, during these working hours,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.320]   there's the periods where I'm focusing on one thing,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960]   and there's other periods where I'm doing a bunch of things.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   And let me make sure that I have a reasonable amount of those
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   focusing one at a time.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.680]   Don't just keep interleaving back and forth.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.320]   That is way more achievable.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.720]   That has nothing to do with dizziness, et cetera.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.680]   It's like, okay, just one thing at a time
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.640]   instead of interleaving, you're gonna get better work done.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   Okay.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   So for your situation, Nana, what this would mean is,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.920]   okay, be very careful with your time
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.780]   during the time that you're working on your student stuff,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.080]   when you're working in your job,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.160]   when you're working your business stuff,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.280]   whatever you're doing, whatever this block of time is for,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360]   just be very aware of attention
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   and maybe try to be more sequential when possible,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.260]   do this and this, and then handle all my emails,
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.640]   as opposed to do these two things
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   while doing all my emails, right?
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.580]   Just like, hey, I wanna give the stuff
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.840]   that's gonna make the most difference,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.320]   the studying for this test,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.240]   the report I'm writing for my boss,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.680]   the new product I'm making for my business.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.400]   You should be in that intense concentration, boom,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.800]   full concentration, intense, high quality product,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.100]   move on to the next thing.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   This will actually give you probably more breathing room
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   in your schedule, because when you give the core things
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.620]   intense attention, they don't take as much time.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.780]   It can actually give you more breathing room
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.880]   in your schedule than if you say, well,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.120]   let me do this work while always having Slack open
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.600]   and always doing email and interleave it all together.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.400]   The things you actually get done take longer,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.160]   you need more hours, you get more frazzled.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.820]   So it actually could be a strategy for saving time.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.760]   One thing at a time, laser focus, boom, done,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.960]   what's next, especially when you have a lot of things
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.440]   competing like you have right now.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   So that's all I want you to think about, Nana.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Again, we're not trying to get you to this image
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   of the cabin with the fire and the quill
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   from George Washington.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.200]   We're just trying to get it so that you're not
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.140]   going back and forth between 17 screens at the same time
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.040]   and doubling the amount of hours it takes for you
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.880]   to get your work done.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.240]   We gotta be in your situation
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.440]   'cause you got a lot going on here.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   We gotta be super intentional about our time.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.200]   One thing at a time, do that thing with intensity,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.940]   move on to the next.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.560]   That's gonna be helpful in almost any situation.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.500]   And it's not only possible,
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.960]   it is actually gonna make most people's situations
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   less hectic, less crowded, less overloading.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.200]   (upbeat music)
