[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.440]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Today's show is sponsored by Innovator ETFs. Before
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.400]   we got on today, I was explaining to Duncan how these buffered ETFs work. So, what they
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.120]   have is three different buffers, a 9%, a 15%, and a 30%. Basically, what you have is that's
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   how much protection you get to the downside. So, let's say the market is down 20%-ish now.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.380]   If you had a 9% buffer, you'd be down 11%. If you had the 15% buffer, you'd be down 5%.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.020]   If you had that 30% buffer, right, you're still protected. But I think it protects you
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.840]   from -5 to -35. Anyway, each of them, the bigger the buffer, the lower your cap is on
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.480]   the upside. Interestingly enough, though, they make these strategies using options.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.720]   And the more volatile the market, the better priced your options can be, right? So, actually,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.560]   your cap is a little higher these days, Innovator tells me. So, if you want to learn more about
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.820]   them, they have a tool on their website, actually, that you can go price these things out. You
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.360]   buy them on the first of the month because that's when they roll over. Go to innovatoretfs.com
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360]   to learn more.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.600]   Yeah, they sound - the reason I had so many questions, they sound like too good to be
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.800]   true, you know? That's why I had a bunch of questions.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.760]   It's interesting, yeah. Again, listen to our old animal spirits with Bruce Bond, we kind
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.440]   of go through them back and forth. But they're going to be sponsoring the show for a while,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.900]   so we'll kind of go through some of the pros and cons of those things. But it's an interesting
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.360]   way to define a range of outcomes. Okay, YouTube comments from last week since I talked about
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   the housing market a little bit. Someone said, "Okay, Ben, you're kind of pessimistic about
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.880]   what's happening in the housing market right now. What's the best case scenario?" Okay,
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   so let me lay out the glass cephal. Higher rates cause prices to stall out for a bit,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.200]   especially in places like Boise and Austin that have these really hot housing markets.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.440]   Let's say inflation comes in a little bit, the Fed tightening slows things down. Mortgage
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.640]   rates can come back to a more normal level for people, which I don't know what normal
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.320]   is these days, but I don't know, call it 4 or 5%. Millennials are still in their household
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.240]   formation years, so they're going to be buying houses. And maybe things just get back to
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.120]   where supply and demand are a little bit more in balance. But the question really depends
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.680]   on what kind of perspective you're talking about. First, a homebuyer or someone who owns
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.880]   a home? Because obviously, if you're a current homeowner, you want things to keep going higher,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.720]   but that's not very fair to other people. So, for everyone involved, I would just like
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.120]   to see more homes being built. So, John, pull up this chart that I created a while ago.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.960]   Number of homes built by decade. You can see the 2010s was by far the lowest of any decade
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.280]   since the 1970s. This is really what we need to do. Unfortunately, it's probably a pipe
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.640]   dream because, as we can see with how cyclical things are, homebuilders are probably not
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.620]   going to do this unless they're incentivized. So, David Halberstam has this book called
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.160]   The 50s. I've referenced it a bunch on my blog and on Animal Spirits before. And he
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.920]   talks about how the Great Depression and World War II really crushed the housing market.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.540]   They just didn't have enough houses. They estimated when people got back from World
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.040]   War II, all the soldiers came back, they needed over 5 million homes. You know what the government
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.140]   did? They rushed this federal housing bill through, and it had very little in the way
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.200]   of controls. So, it basically, they did this federal insurance program to protect builders
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.840]   by any means. And they offered, like, mortgage guarantees, and the builders just went crazy.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.560]   So, they said in 1944, there was 100,000 new homes being built. By 1950, it was 1.7. So,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280]   they built a bunch of homes. There was one thing in the book where they said down payments
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.520]   were either negligible or $1 for a new home. So, and they were selling $11,000 houses.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:46.300]   That's like $133,000 in today's dollars. So, unfortunately, that's the pipe dream. I honestly
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.780]   think the only hope we have is, say, by the end of the decade, the baby boomers all begin
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.380]   to downsize and sell their homes. And that brings supply and demand a little bit more
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.420]   into balance. Obviously, if rates stay high here for a while, I think that's gonna help.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.140]   I really wish there was a way to make it more affordable for more people to buy homes. And
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.420]   I think building is the answer. But unless the government steps in and really does something
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.520]   and I'm not holding my breath on that, I don't know that there's a very good answer here.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.680]   Unless rates just stay higher for a while and just keep people on the sidelines.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   Yeah, I mean, you look at the calculators now of how much home you can afford, and yeah,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.240]   it's gotten worse. Last year, it already felt, or months ago, it already felt pretty bad.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.320]   But yeah, with mortgage rates going up, it's worse.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.560]   Yeah. And I do think, hopefully, having rates be much higher will at least put a cap on
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   those prices. And maybe, especially in the busiest and hottest housing markets, will
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.160]   bring it down a little bit. So, we'll see. That's, unfortunately, my best case scenario.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.000]   Still not very great. But that's where we are. All right, let's do the first one.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.480]   Okay, up first today, we have a question from Adam, who writes, "In the era of free money,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.000]   having 2% to 3% interest debt for things like a car and a house were easy to take on because
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.160]   your investment returns made it worthwhile. However, in the current economy, should I
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.440]   use money I would be putting into a brokerage account to pay off my house and car early?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   Even at 2.8% interest, that's way higher than what stocks are paying right now. And real
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.060]   estate has been a great hedge against inflation in the current market."
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.280]   All right. This, again, depends on what perspective you're looking at it from. So, this is from
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.200]   Adam. And I think Adam is saying he already has a house loan and a car loan, right? So,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.040]   if you have those loans already, I look at it the opposite way. If you still have debt
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.200]   costs that are 2% to 3%, that's even more valuable now that rates are higher and inflation
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.920]   is higher, right? I will personally be paying off my 3% mortgages as slow as possible. If
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.880]   they said, "Ben, we're going to take your 3% mortgage and allow you to pay it off over
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.240]   50 years instead of 30," I'd take them up on that offer. I'm going to hold on to that
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.680]   3% mortgage for dear life. It's tax advantage. It's more than 5% lower than inflation right
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.760]   now. Why would I pay that off? Inflation is a bad thing for spending purposes, but it's
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.440]   awesome for people who hold debt. Why? Because if you're making fixed payments over time,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   those payments are worth less and less over time. So, let's say you took out a $350,000
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.560]   mortgage last year with a 30-year fixed rate of 3%, which is around what it was. With inflation
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.720]   running at 8% over the last year, it's actually, whatever, 8.6%, your $1,475 monthly payment
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.400]   would now be running around $1,350. In real terms, right? Based on last year. And even
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.240]   if inflation going over the next five years was 3%, let's say it comes back down, that
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:31.460]   $1,350 now is equivalent to $1,165 in five years. Right? Because that's maybe the one
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.780]   silver lining of inflation, that it eats up debt. And I know a lot of people are worried
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.240]   about our government's huge debt problem. It's kind of weird to think that inflation
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.960]   is actually a solution for it, but it is. Inflation is actually eating away at government
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.920]   debt. So, that's a good thing for people who hold debt.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.680]   So, you're saying this could all be part of the master plan?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.040]   Lewis: It's possible. But, the other way is, if you're taking out new loans. Now, let's
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.280]   say you're taking out a new loan, and you're paying 6% mortgage, and you're paying 5% on
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.080]   your car loan. I think that's a much different story, where you can start to think, well,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.240]   that's almost a guaranteed return on that money, paying it back. And it's a much higher
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.760]   hurdle rate. And I think then, the calculus changes on that. Obviously, we've talked about
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.560]   this before, the question of whether to pay off debt or not is a personal one. It doesn't
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.720]   always come down to hurdle rates or inflation calculations, and sometimes people really
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.560]   want to pay it off. But, I think if we're comparing 2-3% borrowing rates to stocks and
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.600]   bonds today, financial assets are much more appealing to me than paying off 2-3% debt,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.440]   especially when it's tax advantaged. Bond yields are much higher than they've been for
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.400]   a long time. The last year, 10-year Treasuries were this high, it was like 2011. I know they're
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.000]   falling a little bit today. And I know it doesn't feel like it, but stock market returns
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.440]   are going up, as stocks are going down. Expected returns are going up. So, as long as you have
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   the ability to service your debts, I see no reason to pay them off if your bogey is the
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.280]   stock and bond markets right now, and if you have those lower interest rates. If you have
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.040]   higher interest rates now, I think that's a different question.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.600]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.840]   All right, let's do another one. Speaking of bonds, let's do a bond one here.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.720]   Okay. So, up next, we have a question from Mike. "I'm 49 years old, high earner, high
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.240]   savings rate, $1 million in retirement accounts, and $2 million in property. I have historically
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.880]   maintained an allocation of 35% US index, 33% international index, 30% bond funds, and
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.720]   2% speculation in stocks. Bonds have been getting crushed. Should I continue to hold
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.800]   this allocation knowing that this portion is definitely going to drop in value? I'm
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.640]   thinking about moving a portion of my bond allocation to some strong companies that have
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.600]   been clobbered but pay 2-3% dividends. I've been thinking my bond allocation is too high
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.920]   given investments in property. Thoughts?"
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.560]   All right, it is true. Bonds have been getting crushed. But it's not been an even distribution.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.880]   So, John, throw up this chart here of bond returns. This is bond drawdowns. And I went
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.320]   across the spectrum. So, the longest duration, which is zero coupon. Then I looked at the
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.720]   20 to 30 year treasury, all the way down to one to three year treasury. You can see zero
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.980]   coupon bonds and 20 to 30 year treasuries are down even more than the stock market.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.960]   And these are from the lows in March 2020, actually, when weights went really, really
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.600]   low. But you can see even the U.S. aggregate, which is like a bond index fund. It's in a
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.280]   12 or 13% drawdown right now. Three to seven year treasuries are down 10%. And then you
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.440]   look at one to three year treasuries, not down as much, 4%. So, it really depends on
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.960]   what kind of bonds you're talking about here in the duration. But I can't say for certain
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.120]   that this viewer thinks bonds are going to continue to get crushed. We don't know that
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.560]   for sure. Interest rates could continue to go higher. But here's the thing that's different
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.040]   this time around. Because rates are now higher, you actually have a little bit of a cushion
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.440]   for once. It's not like treasuries are coming from 50 basis points all the way up and you
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.800]   have no yield to protect you. So, bonds getting crushed means bond returns in the future are
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.880]   higher. Because starting yield really matters. And because if you look at expected returns,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.360]   bonds are guided by math. Not over the short term, but over the long run. So, stocks, their
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.440]   yes fundamentals like earnings growth and dividend yield, these things matter. But the
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.200]   other piece of stock market returns is, what are investors willing to pay for them? We've
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.640]   been seeing this year, not only have stocks been coming down, but P/E ratios have been
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.240]   coming down even faster, right? And P/E ratios are really, evaluations of all kinds, are
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.460]   really emotions. Like, what are people willing to pay for stocks or the stock market? Bonds
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.720]   are guided by math. So, let's, John, throw up this first one of five year treasury yields
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.400]   versus one year returns. So, this is a starting five year treasury yield going back to the
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.360]   60s. And then, the orange line there is forward one year returns. You can see they're all
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.560]   over the map. It's kind of in the same general direction over time, the highs and lows. But
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.960]   it's way, way wider than the ranges. So, the correlation here between five year yields,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.920]   starting yields and one year returns is like 0.6. It's got a relationship, for sure, and
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.800]   it's positive. But it's not perfect. So, now let's go out a little further. Let's go to
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.720]   three year returns, right? This is starting five year treasury yields versus three year
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.480]   forward returns. Now, we're looking a little closer here, right? The correlation is closer
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.000]   to 0.8. You can see, but there's still some wide swings where returns get a little wider
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.240]   than or lower than the actual starting yield. And now, let's do the last one. Five year
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.680]   yields versus five year returns. Now, we're pretty close. The correlation here is like
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.760]   0.92. So, this is a very strong relationship where your starting yield is going to determine
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.800]   your longer run returns and bonds. So, if bond yields right now are 3%, I feel pretty
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.320]   good saying, you know, five to seven years, maybe ten years, if you're using intermediate
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.400]   term bonds, you're probably going to get roughly 3% returns, give or take. Because obviously,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.360]   the interest rates move a little bit. That can change things. But no one knows what's
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.760]   going to happen with bonds in the short term. Interest rates can move and fluctuate. But
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.000]   over the long term, the starting yield is the thing that matters. That's why I was so
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.920]   worried about bonds in March of 2020, because rates were so low. So, you can't exactly live
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.720]   off the interest right now. But it's much better than it has been. And so, even if things
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.640]   get dicey for the next 6 to 12 months, if rates could go higher from here and inflation
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.380]   stays high, sure, bonds could continue to get hurt. But you're in a much better place
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.000]   than you were. Now, having said all that, this doesn't necessarily mean you have to
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.680]   invest in bonds. This viewer asked if they really need bonds because of real estate investments,
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.920]   right? Yeah, there's high allocation of real estate. Some people think that real estate
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.000]   holdings are like a form of debt, so that makes it kind of like bonds, right? Where
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.040]   you have a hurdle rate, which we talked about in the last question. I think a lot of this
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.640]   depends on how you think about portfolio management. Like, did you invest -- why did you invest
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.240]   in bonds in the first place? Did you invest in them because they're a form of dry powder?
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.800]   Because sometimes they are not as volatile when stocks go down. That's not the case this
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.240]   year, but most of the time it is. You can't really rebalance a real estate property, right?
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.040]   If you were using bonds to rebalance your stock portfolio, you can't do that with real
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.520]   estate. A house is not liquid. You can't spend it. So, this answer really depends on your
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.800]   ability to live with 100% stock in a real estate portfolio and not have some sort of
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.440]   liquid savings that you can use to potentially rebalance and have diversification.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.840]   So, I don't know. Does a stock market real estate portfolio make sense to you? I guess
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.920]   for the right type of investor, they understand those risks. Bonds haven't helped much of
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.120]   late, but that doesn't mean they won't in the next downturn. So, do you want to get
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   out of bonds because you've experienced some losses and you're just ready to pull the ripcord,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.720]   or just because they don't fit your personality and you want something else? But, yeah, having
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.800]   that real estate exposure, that opens you up to a bunch of other different risks. So,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.400]   I think you've got to define what you want to get out of it and why do you have it in
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.920]   the first place.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.840]   What do you think could be the long-term ramifications of so many people souring on bonds now, being
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.360]   like, "They didn't protect me when I thought they were supposed to protect me," et cetera?
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.880]   It is interesting, the psychological scars that markets can -- because after 2008, no
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.840]   one wanted to touch the stock market forever, right? Everyone thought the stock market was
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.080]   a casino and a roller coaster, and guess what? The stock market did wonderfully for the next
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.940]   10 to 12 years. That's the thing with bonds now, is that bond yields are higher, again,
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.200]   meaning expected returns are going higher, but people look in the rearview mirror and
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.640]   see losses. So, yeah, I think you're right. There could be a psychological component where
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.920]   people say, "I'm not going to wait around to see that happen again." But then that pushes
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.000]   you out of the risk spectrum, right? And makes you take more risks. So, yeah, maybe that
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   is a possibility.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.480]   Yeah, the chat's not having it. 77% of people said no, they do not have a meaningful bond
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   allocation in their portfolio. That's 57 votes, but still, maybe significant.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.640]   We are an anti-survey show, but we'll take it. Let's do another one.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:37.120]   Up next, we have a question from Jolie. They are based in Hong Kong. "I'm turning 24 in
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.520]   a few days and I'm from Hong Kong. Happy birthday." I don't know when this came in, but happy
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.560]   birthday anyway. "I make around $40,000 a year, currently have around $60,000 saved,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.800]   half equity, half cash, savings insurance, retirement account, and other stuff. Due to
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.600]   the extremely high cost of living, the most expensive housing in the world for more than
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.080]   a decade, and the worsening political situation here, many Hong Kongers are considering migration.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.600]   Most of my friends are moving to the UK or Canada. I'm qualified for the UK's high potential
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.760]   individual visa, and Canada has a similar visa for degree holders. My big question is,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.600]   how should people my age plan before moving to another country? Should I bear a few more
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.620]   years to save enough money, since Hong Kong is good for saving and I don't need to pay
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.880]   rent, then move with less pressure?" So, a couple questions built in here.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.060]   All right. So, Visual Capitalists actually did this infographic where they looked at
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.080]   the least affordable housing markets in the world. And I think number one was Duncan's
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.440]   neighborhood in Brooklyn when he re-ups his lease this year.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   Yeah. Definitely.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.600]   Pretty close. Actually, Hong Kong is the worst. So, they calculated this by looking at median
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.200]   house price divided by median household income. And they say anything above five is severely
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.240]   unaffordable. You can see a lot of them are actually in the US, mostly in California.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.960]   It's LA, San Francisco, San Jose, then Honolulu, Vancouver, and Toronto around there, Sydney.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.200]   But Hong Kong is the worst one. Now, this person says they don't need to pay rent. So,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.480]   maybe they're just worried about buying a house in a few years. Which makes sense to
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   me.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.840]   Isn't that stat on there crazy? 7% of Hong Kong is zoned for housing? I saw that on their
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.320]   infographic. It's crazy.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.900]   Yeah. That makes sense. So, the good news is at 24, you have the ability to take some
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.080]   risks and try things out. So, I think as long as you're comfortable moving to a new country,
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.360]   I say, yeah, go for it. Why not, right? Live in a new city, meet new people, try new things.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.680]   You said you had some friends that are moving to these places. If it doesn't work out,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.280]   you can always try to move back to Hong Kong or try somewhere else, right? You talked about
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.800]   going to London or the States.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.680]   I think if you have no responsibilities holding you back, now is the time to do something
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.720]   like this. And this seems like the kind of thing to me where there probably doesn't have
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.660]   to be a whole lot of planning involved. As long as you have your career stuff figured
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.400]   out and you can find a job where you go and you can find a place to live, I think this
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.360]   is one of those regret type situations where in, I don't know, 20 years when you have more
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.520]   responsibilities and you're more settled down and maybe you have a family or something or
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   you own a house and you're putting down roots, I don't know, are you really going to regret
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.320]   trying to move and live in a new city and try something new?
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.560]   Again, you can always move back if it's an obvious mistake. The good news is when you're
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.640]   young you have a lot of time ahead of you to make up for mistakes, both in the form
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.200]   of decades ahead of you plus human capital savings. I think, and moving out of the least
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.120]   affordable city in the world and moving somewhere more affordable means financially it should
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.340]   be easier. And it sounds like you have your finances in order for a 24-year-old, right?
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.500]   When I was a senior in college, I lived in Philadelphia for a semester. Between my sophomore
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:41.960]   and junior years, our small tiny liberal arts college in West Michigan would send 60 kids
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.280]   to Vienna for a summer program every year. I went there. Those are some of the greatest
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.360]   memories I have in my life. So I think going somewhere else and trying it out and trying
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.480]   a new culture and a new place, I think if you're adventurous enough and you're willing
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.120]   to do it, I see no reason not to as a young person. Again, you can always move back if
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   you need to.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.260]   Yeah, and they mentioned the political situation there. So it seems like they have more on
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.540]   their mind than just the financial. So that's something that is kind of hard to quantify.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:11.500]   Yes. Yes. Something that, yeah, I know we complain about politics here, but yeah, something
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:18.060]   like that, that's probably much scarier. And I agree. Let's do another one.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:24.420]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Michael. And so this is one that our regular viewers
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.420]   are going to recognize from a couple of weeks back on what are your thoughts, but we had
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.980]   to do a deeper dive because it's just too-
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:34.060]   This is one where it came in and we were all passing it around, me and you and Michael
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:39.860]   and Josh and everyone and kind of going, "What? What?" So we wanted to go over this one in
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.860]   a little more detail.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.860]   Yeah, it's very cinematic. So yeah, this one, okay, I'm not going to say her name actually,
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.860]   but okay.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.860]   Wait, Duncan.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.860]   Do you say cinema instead of movies?
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:54.660]   I use them kind of interchangeably, but yeah, I mean, cinema would be, I guess, the next
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.660]   level, right? You have film.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.140]   For me, the Pooh meme is movie, film, cinema.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:05.460]   Right, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Kurosawa is cinema, right? Yeah. Okay. I'm a 40-year-old tennis
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.460]   coach in California. Our tennis club is a registered nonprofit and I'm grateful that
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:15.980]   they offer a 401(k) with a 4% match. Unfortunately, the general manager's spouse manages the plan.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:22.060]   He is not a CFP, charges 1.22% management fee, actively picks stocks and provides zero
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:27.380]   transparency with my 401(k) balance or his returns. I only know how much I've contributed
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.780]   and the company match, including vesting. Obviously, this is a conflict of interest,
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.580]   even though he isn't technically a fiduciary. I don't think it's a Ponzi scheme, but I'm
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.660]   only contributing the 4% to get the match instead of the max amount. I'm maxing out
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.780]   my traditional IRA since I make too much for the Roth and I invest in real estate and have
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.100]   a brokerage account. Thoughts, suggestions?
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.460]   Alright, so the person that we went to on this internally is Dan LaRosa, who works at
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.620]   Ritual Wealth Management. He helps manage our corporate retirement plans. Dan has worked
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.460]   with a lot of 401(k) plans over the years.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.460]   Hey, Dan.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.140]   Alright, Dan. When you saw this one, is this the most shocking 401(k) plan you've ever
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:10.140]   seen? And then, what is going on here? And also, for people who aren't quite this crazy,
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.460]   but maybe kind of crazy, what do you even do when you see a 401(k) plan that has obvious
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.620]   flaws in it?
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.340]   Yeah, this is a tough one. I was actually pretty furious when I first read this and
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:29.180]   I think my response to Sean was a 7,000-word email, breaking it down. But go to management,
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.380]   first off. Talk to somebody. I know he said it would be uncomfortable. The general manager's
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.100]   husband is managing the account.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.620]   By the way, how often do you see that? Because I feel like a lot of times you would hear
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.060]   with small businesses, "Well, the reason we chose this 401(k) plan is because my brother-in-law
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.780]   uses it," or knows someone. Isn't that how this technically works for a lot of places?
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.300]   It's not uncommon at all. It's really not. And that by itself wouldn't be necessarily
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:59.580]   a problem. But there are nine other items here that when combined with the fact that
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.540]   the general manager is his wife, it's not really a good look.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.860]   But talk to management. You've got to keep in mind, the people that have, in most cases
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:15.020]   or usually, the people that have the larger balances in these retirement plans are management.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.060]   It's the owners. It's the people that maybe are making decisions on the retirement plan.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:25.460]   So any suggestions you're making to lower the costs or increase the investment quality,
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.340]   whatever it is, is probably going to have an outsized impact on those individuals.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.060]   Do you think that there's any ... Is this the type of situation where regulators need
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.940]   to get involved or could be brought in somehow?
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.580]   This is my question for you guys. Just from a non-financial professional perspective,
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.260]   it sounds like something that would be illegal.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.940]   Based on what he said here, I don't see anything necessarily illegal. Are there red flags?
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:55.460]   Yeah, there's red flags all over the place. But it's not a Ponzi scheme. I don't see anything
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:02.060]   necessarily illegal. But we also don't have all the details of what's going on here.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.900]   The biggest thing here is this is not at all your traditional 401k plan, right? Most plans,
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:11.580]   the plan that we're in, the plan that most people are in, they're participant directed.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.100]   That just means that participants can make their own investment decisions. Within the
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.620]   confines of the plan, you can pick and choose how you want your money invested. You can
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.780]   make changes to it whenever you want.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:28.380]   This sounds like a single pooled account where this advisor is managing the retirement plan's
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.380]   money in one single account for all the participants. It's not popular or common at all. I don't
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:41.500]   know why they would opt into this sort of setup, other than maybe the nice fat management.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.900]   What was your advice to check to see, just to make sure there's nothing nefarious going
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:52.500]   on here, to make sure that this plan is kind of legit? What do you even do?
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:59.180]   Well, actually, the fact, I mean, the management fee, okay, yeah, it's high. The biggest thing
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:05.220]   here, and I think where he could maybe, the part that I would lean on, is no transparency.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:11.820]   All retirement plans are required to provide participants at least annually, normally quarterly.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.620]   I think even these pooled plans, it's once a year, you have to get a 401k statement.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.780]   That has to show not just what you've contributed and what the match was. You can find that
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.540]   out on a pay stub, but it has to show the breakdown, how that money's invested, a beginning
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.140]   balance and an ending balance. The fact that he's not getting that, that's the biggest
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:36.820]   red flag for me. He said it would be an uncomfortable conversation and I appreciate that, but I
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:42.260]   think you still need to have it. This is where I would try and dig in, even if he says something
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:48.660]   like I'm working with an advisor and he or she was asking or requesting about information
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.940]   on all of my outside accounts, how that money's invested. Well, you need to have that, so
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:58.060]   maybe the request for this information can come from a third party.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.020]   Douglass: Unfortunately, sometimes in life you have to have uncomfortable conversations
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.620]   and this is one of those times where it certainly makes sense. All right, Duncan, let's do
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.620]   one more.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.220]   Duncan: Okay, yeah. Thanks for doing a deeper dive on that one. One follow-up on that I
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.020]   just wanted to mention for the new whales in the audience. You mentioned that management
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:21.300]   fee and they allude to the fact that it's really high. What's a more reasonable fee
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.660]   that you would expect to see on a plan like that?
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:29.900]   I mean, anything north of 1% is usually ... In a 401(k) plan, it's usually going to be half
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.740]   a percent. Something like that would be reasonable. Again, we don't know anything, any specs of
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.140]   the plan. We don't know how large it is, how many people there are. We know he's actively
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.460]   picking stocks, which is ...
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.220]   So, it's significantly higher than you would expect.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.020]   Yeah, sounds like it.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:51.180]   Okay. Last but not least, I have a HELOC with a variable interest rate of 6.5% and a balance
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.220]   of $39,000. I also have an unsecured line of credit with a balance of $9,500 and an
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.500]   interest rate of 14.2%. I was quite surprised that the interest rate jumped so high. I pay
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.460]   both monthly, but these payments are only covering the interest. I'm considering taking
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.260]   a loan for my 401(k) plan to pay down the highest interest debt and make it more manageable.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.260]   What are your thoughts?
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.500]   Also, you might remind people what a HELOC even is.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.300]   Yeah, home equity line of credit, and that's using your house as security for that debt.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.420]   Obviously, as mortgage rates rise, those rates can rise a little, too. I'm guessing the unsecured
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.780]   line of credit is something similar to a credit card, would make sense to me. I don't know
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.180]   exactly what it is. But, Dan, this is essentially a personal balance sheet move, where you use
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:42.540]   the 401(k) balance to pay it off. I'm trying to think if there's better ways to do this,
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.460]   but why don't you kind of compare and contrast taking the 401(k) loan to some kind of other
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.900]   debt consolidation? What are the pros and cons of the 401(k) loan to get yourself out
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.540]   of debt elsewhere?
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:58.780]   Yeah, so basics on 401(k) loan. Generally, you can borrow up to $50,000. The loan has
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.940]   to be repaid normally within five years under most circumstances. You do pay interest on
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:09.680]   this, but it goes back into your 401(k) account. The interest rate is prime plus one, sometimes
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.020]   prime plus 2%. Prime right now is 4.2%.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.340]   That's the one that's never really made sense to me. Why do you pay interest to yourself
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.580]   on these? What's the point of that?
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.060]   Basically, I think the idea is, okay, taking money out of your 401(k) is a horrible idea.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.700]   You shouldn't be doing it, for obvious reasons. That's where the magic happens in any 401(k)
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.300]   loan. You take a retirement account with compounding, and when you take a loan out, that goes directly
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.660]   against it. You're taking money out of the market and still paying it back. If you have
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.260]   interest repayments going back into your 401(k) account, that helps make up for it a little
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:50.100]   bit. I think that just kind of lessens the blow of taking the money out.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.540]   Again, loan repayments and interest, again, are going back into your 401(k) account. Generally
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:01.820]   speaking, I'm really anti 401(k) loan. I feel more of these types of questions than you
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   would think. Actually, just a couple of hours ago, I spoke to someone in a somewhat similar
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:12.300]   situation, doing a home renovation and wanted to know about his 401(k) loan. Again, you're
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.980]   taking money out of the market. You're kind of defeating the purpose of the 401(k), and
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:23.700]   then couple that with the fact that we're in the midst of a 20 plus percent drawdown.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.100]   You're really selling low here, and then you're slowly reinvesting over time. You're missing
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.860]   out potentially, I don't know what markets are going to do, but missing out potentially
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.820]   on a lot of tax-deferred growth.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.620]   That's a good point. With stocks being down so much that you're taking this loan at a
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:44.860]   really unopportune time. You're saying in terms of different places to do debt, 401(k)
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.620]   loan should probably be one of your last options.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.340]   That's what I usually say. It should be emergency only.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.500]   It makes sense to me.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.780]   Something people don't often think of, your 401(k) loan, your 401(k) is an employer-sponsored
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:05.180]   plan. The biggest risk with the 401(k) is what happens if you leave your job? If you
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:10.380]   leave voluntarily or you get fired, whatever the case. If I take out a $10,000 loan today
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:17.620]   and I leave next week, I'm on the hook. Normally, you have 90 days to pay back that loan. If
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:23.420]   you don't, the loan defaults. It's deemed a distribution, which means you pay tax on
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.020]   the outstanding balance. You also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not age
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.020]   59.5. There is that job security risk, as well, that you want to take into consideration.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.780]   Lewis: Yeah, which is really good consideration right now. If the Fed's trying to slow things
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:43.860]   down and throws us into a recession, unemployment rate increases, that's another good point.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:50.140]   I would start with the unsecured loan, that 14.2%. Talk about a hurdle rate. There's a
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.100]   couple things you do. Some sort of debt consolidation, I would talk to one of those places. But also,
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.980]   try to negotiate it. Say, "I can't pay more than the interest rate on this. I'm going
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.540]   to eventually have to default on this," or something. A lot of these places will actually
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.340]   negotiate with you. They would rather get something rather than nothing. The HELOC is
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.520]   a different story, but I would start with that 14.2%, that $9,500, and I would talk
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.220]   to them and see if they're willing to negotiate. They might not make it out there with anything.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.300]   That makes sense. I do like the idea of having that hierarchy of loans and having the 401(k)
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.460]   be that last, last, last line of defense. You're right, there's a lot of factors right
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.780]   now that go into it. Stocks are down, and maybe the economy slows and some people lose
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.980]   their jobs. That's a double whammy if that happened to you.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.020]   Lewis: So, you're saying play it hardball, then.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.800]   Maxfield: Yeah. But honestly, if you call financial institutions, a lot of people hate
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.960]   negotiating. Listen, Duncan, I was on the phone with AT&T this morning. Every 12 months,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:54.680]   my teaser rate goes away and my cable bill goes up. What do I do every 12 months? "Hey,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.440]   AT&T, I'm going to leave. Give me the retention department." "No, no, no, sir. We'll give
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.760]   you $50 off and bring you right back down to where you were." People hate negotiating
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.600]   in this country. You have to. Let's say you're wonderful with your bank and your credit cards
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.200]   and all that stuff, you pay stuff on time. Let's say you accidentally missed a payment
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.520]   and you didn't have it automatically for some reason, and they charge you a late fee. Call
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.960]   them up. Tell them, "Listen, I've been a great customer with you for seven years. Can you
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.440]   take that off for me?" Nine times out of ten, they will do that.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.560]   Niu: I do that every time, and they take it off every time.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.640]   Lewis: What if you are an investor in AT&T? Can you pull that card? Can you be like, "As
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.800]   a shareholder..."
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:39.040]   There you go. Just saying. Negotiating is not something I'm very great at, but you have
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:45.920]   to try it. Remember, if you have any questions on credit cards, travel hacks, airline rewards,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.680]   all that stuff, shoot us a question. Next week, we're having Chris Hutchinson, who is
