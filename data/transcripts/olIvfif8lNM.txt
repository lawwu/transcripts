[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.400]   - My guy Trey in the building,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.840]   what's good with you, fam, bro?
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.140]   - My guy.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.980]   - Sir.
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.800]   - What's good, guy?
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.640]   - Yes, sir.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.480]   - All right, bro, so let's get it poppin'.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   So first, I wanna start off at high school.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.180]   Do you remember how we met?
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.960]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.400]   Nike Elite, was it?
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.280]   - You know, at the top of Hunter Camp?
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.400]   - You remember, in St. Louis?
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.960]   - Yeah, I remember 'cause I remember
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840]   seeing this light-skinned dude,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.940]   and he was like, you was like what, like five?
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.780]   You was like five, what are you?
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.920]   - I was like five, six.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.640]   - And he was just gettin' buckets, you know?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.080]   - No, no, no, no, no, I was like five, 10.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.760]   - But everybody was at that camp,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.040]   and that was when I first met you,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.400]   and then we, and then the time when we,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.880]   the time I really remember was we was at that gym
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.800]   with Mo Can, you walked in the door,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.720]   and Coach Perry was like, man, it's this kid coming,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.000]   he's like the best point guard in the area,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.880]   and I had no idea who it was, and you walked in the door,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.040]   and I was like, man, this dude, I remember this dude,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.760]   but I didn't remember you being that good from the camp,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.560]   and we had a practice or whatever,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.040]   and you was like, you was killin' like,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   same game you have now, you was doin' your thing,
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.400]   and then that's when we linked up.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.960]   - No, for real, I remember that 'cause that was
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.800]   right after, 'cause that was my first time
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.040]   goin' to practice, goin' to Kansas City,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.160]   I think that was the first time we actually linked
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   after the game 100 was, was that, that practice was great.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.360]   - Yeah, how did you even, what made you wanna play
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.680]   with Mo Can, though?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.400]   - Reason why I came over to Mo Can,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.320]   Coach P hit me up, Matt Souther,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.200]   told me I was able to come play with you,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.360]   I was playin' in Dallas, and our team wouldn't,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.800]   wouldn't really like that. - No, I didn't know.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   - I was tryin' to play on the 17U level,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.480]   and then I was tryin' to come over to Nike
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.600]   and, and play with Mo Can, so I,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480]   they gave me an opportunity to play with you, so,
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.720]   I was like, yeah. - Yeah, it was great.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   I mean, for the jump, we had like a crazy chemistry,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.200]   like, from the jump, and that was our 16s,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.120]   and we was playin' up 17s, I think.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.360]   - Yeah, it made it easy 'cause we were both young,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.400]   and we were out of town, and we,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.880]   remember we had to stay over at Coach Dave's
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760]   house all the time? - Yep, Coach Dave's.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.360]   - So we had a lot of time, we was just in the basement,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.160]   chillin', watchin' games. - So that's when we,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.800]   yeah, that's when we first got real close.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.280]   We was tryin' to sneak out the crib.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.760]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.640]   - Yeah, I remember that, so.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120]   And then, so that 16s year, we had that year,
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.160]   and we, we made PSJA, and we ended up
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.520]   losin' the pool play, right?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.920]   - Yeah, we, I don't even think we won two games.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   - I think we won two out of three.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.400]   - Yeah. - And then we was like,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640]   but we knew we had the potential to be like, cold.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.480]   - Yeah, yeah. - And so,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   we knew we was gonna come back that next year,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   and then 17s, we came back, and we was, we was dominant.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.120]   I think we lost, what, one game?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.960]   Two games? - Yeah, two games all season.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.320]   - Which one you think we should watch,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.200]   this one or this one?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   - Nah, bro, the PSJA one, bro.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.560]   - This one?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.380]   I ain't seen it.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.480]   We was so tough, bro.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.800]   - Hey, first play of the game was good.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.840]   - That was the first play of the game.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.080]   - Our whole class was pretty much in the lead.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.240]   - Yeah, we were in the lead.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240]   - Good, Tay.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.280]   - Lay.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   - Good, Tay.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.000]   I love you, man.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.920]   - Yeah, we was getting too hype, yo.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.000]   First, first half, I don't know, man.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.480]   Hey, he was not missing, though, that's--
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.840]   - Jarrett, really?
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.080]   - That whole, that whole PSJA?
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   - I don't know, bro.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.440]   - I be telling people we was like the best
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.200]   AU program ever, like ever.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.920]   - Yeah, I mean, we in the conversation, for sure.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.000]   I think we, I can't argue with my friends all the time,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.240]   like players, they always talk about the AU team.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.880]   Like, I don't see a team that can match up with us.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.160]   - Nah, 'cause it was like, we went to Peach Jam,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.360]   and it wasn't like we was winning by two or 10 or whatever.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.920]   We was winning by like 30.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.680]   - Every game. - Every game.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.520]   - So, what was your favorite memories, would you say,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.000]   from that whole, from that whole, like AU side of thing?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.160]   - I think, really, just what we were just talking about,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.480]   like the time when we were going
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.520]   and having those three days on Saturdays,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.400]   and like, throughout the day,
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.960]   we're always kicking it with each other.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.360]   Like, me and you, with the team,
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.040]   like, we're either going to watch other games,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.200]   or we're at the crib, or we're doing something.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.400]   Like, we're always with each other.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.760]   - We were always together, every weekend.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.600]   - Every weekend.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   So, for us, out of state, like, we were always,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.640]   me and you were always together,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.000]   'cause we didn't have nowhere else to go.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.360]   Like, I mean, your parents were always busy,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.280]   like your family, mine, same way.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.840]   Like, they're doing their stuff,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.120]   so we were always with each other.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.640]   So, that's, I think, why we were so close.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.920]   - We got close. - Craziest.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.680]   - We went, remember, we was trying to make college work, too.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.520]   - Yeah.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.360]   - Trying to make the college thing work,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.520]   but we could never get it happening.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.280]   What was your favorite camp we did?
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.120]   Like, any of that.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.080]   We did so much, we did Chile, T-U-S-A.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.320]   - You think N-Day Top 100 was fun?
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   - I thought it was, it was fun.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.880]   It was like, it was informative,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.400]   'cause we'd hoop, and we'd have the class stuff.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.240]   - Yeah.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.280]   - And everybody was there, though.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.120]   That's what I like about it.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.960]   Every good player was there.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.400]   - That's what I think about it, yeah.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   - But it was cool.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.040]   You was killing.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.520]   That's really like when you took a leap.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.800]   That, I remember seeing that video,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.840]   I think it was "A Baller's Life"
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.240]   that came out of you and Gary going back and forth.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.680]   - Oh yeah, me and Gary went back, yeah.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.520]   - Yeah, that was crazy.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.120]   - No, that was cool, that was cool.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.320]   We had a, yeah, U-S-A.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.960]   U-S-A was, that was just a long, a long trip.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.400]   - Bro, they kept trying to make you say, "Thank you."
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.240]   Remember?
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.480]   (laughing)
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.760]   - Look, you're not allowed to say thank you.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.000]   (laughing)
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.320]   - Bro, I was good like, man.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.080]   - Oh wait, that's my teammate now.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.240]   - Who?
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   Who?
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.200]   - Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.800]   - Oh yeah, does he play?
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.520]   - Yeah, he plays a little bit.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.440]   - They were really tripping on saying, "Thank you."
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.400]   - No, that's, it was for the assist.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.880]   - I know.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.720]   - Hey.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.560]   - Look, you didn't say it.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.400]   Look, I know you didn't say it.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.920]   (laughing)
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.400]   I knew it, I already knew it.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.960]   (laughing)
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.680]   - U-S-A was crazy, but the food they gave us was so weak.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.520]   Hey.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.120]   - Look, no, you didn't say it.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.760]   (laughing)
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.360]   You didn't say it.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.120]   You didn't say it in fast enough.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.440]   - Bro, that is crazy.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   - They was tripping on that, too.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.480]   You had to say it like.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   - I mean, that was the thing.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.320]   You was balling, you had MVP.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.160]   - U-S-A?
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.000]   - You had MVP.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.840]   - Yeah, nah, I remember.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.480]   - I was back there, Matt Coleman.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.640]   'Cause we had, it was like, we had a camp,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.960]   and then we went to Team Europe.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.600]   No, we had Peach Jam, I think.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.960]   And then we went to some camp.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.560]   And then we did Chile.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   And then we went to another Nike camp.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.840]   We was with each other for like a month.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.880]   And people, we got so tired of each other.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.200]   Me and this dude got so tired of each other.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.360]   And I remember, we was in Chile.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.720]   And Chile was so crazy.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.520]   Is that how you pronounce it, Chile?
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.880]   - Chile, yeah.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.720]   - We was up there, and we had been with each other
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.560]   for like a month.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.640]   And then we was like rooming together the whole time.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.160]   We was so tired of each other.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.360]   And I think that's the only time
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   we really got into like a real fight.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.320]   We got into like an argument.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.160]   You remember that?
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.280]   - Yeah, we were in LA though.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.760]   We were at the Skills Academy.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   - That's when we got into a fight?
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.480]   - Yeah, that was the last place.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.320]   - That was the last place.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.560]   We was so tired of each other.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.760]   - It was all, all we could do was FaceTime.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.840]   He wanted me to turn off the lights.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.800]   - So this is what happened.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.880]   So we had been with each other for like a month.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.920]   And I'm tired, I'm trying to go to sleep.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   This dude on FaceTime with his girl.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.280]   I'm like, "Bro, turn the light off."
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.120]   But he had the light on.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.240]   I'm like, "Bro, you can't FaceTime with the light off?"
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.560]   He's like, "Nah, bro, I'm with the light on."
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.680]   So I get up out of my bed, and I go, "Turn the light off."
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.000]   Soon as I get back from my bed,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.840]   he turned the light back on.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.160]   I'm like, "Bro."
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.080]   So I get back up, turn the light off.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.280]   He turned it back on again.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.600]   And then like literally we both just was so like
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.120]   irritated with each other, we started fighting.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   Like actually like fighting.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.800]   - For real, for real.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.360]   - I think, yeah, I got a picture somewhere, but.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.200]   - I do remember that.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.880]   That was.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.720]   - Hey, you was just, it was a trip, bro.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.880]   - No, that was fun, though.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.480]   - But going like from high school,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.240]   so you was ranked like, I think like in the 20 to 30 range.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.040]   But like every player you played against
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.280]   in your position, you was killing.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.800]   But they still had you ranked so like,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.960]   so they didn't have you ranked like high enough.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.080]   Why do you think that was?
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.160]   Like what were people tripping about with you?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.800]   And what was the like criticism you got in high school?
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.760]   - I think it was just more like just my,
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.560]   just my, nobody really thought that my game
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.640]   would translate to the next level, I think.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.360]   And for me, it was just about showing it.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.880]   I think once I got to college and played on TV
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.240]   and played in front of all these people,
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.840]   like my game, you know this,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.120]   and my game hasn't really changed since high school.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.280]   So it's like, it's really just since once I got
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.760]   on a national stage and played in front of more people,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.920]   more eyes, more people saw my game could translate.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.200]   So that's, that's really what it was.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.040]   And I think it was just people and you know,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.200]   people, people can, people can boost it.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.920]   Like you should have been number one player
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.040]   in high school for the longest.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.440]   But it's like, everything is, it's all politics.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.760]   Like it's all politics.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.480]   - And they'll find something like, if they don't,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.960]   and it's so crazy 'cause they'll, they'll judge these kids.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.560]   But like, look at what you're doing right now.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.040]   Like they wasn't looking what you was doing right now.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.240]   Every matchup you had against another good point guard,
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.280]   you was killing them.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.320]   So, but they was basing everything off of potential.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.240]   But like, that's what I don't get about like some
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.960]   of these rankers or analysts or whatever.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   Like you're doing the same exact thing.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.920]   Your game hasn't changed.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.760]   I remember one of the things they said was like,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.280]   they didn't think you was athletic enough
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.400]   or couldn't get your shot off at the next level.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.360]   But like, athleticism is more than just having balance.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.320]   Like you ain't got no balance,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   but you got like every other athleticism you have.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.160]   Like you're quick,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.600]   you're one of the fastest players in the league.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.800]   Like, and you get your shot off whenever you want.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.360]   Your body control is crazy.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.040]   And that's like, they was missing that.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.680]   But like, we always knew that you was like,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.880]   and I used to always tell you,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.600]   like you're the number one point guard.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.480]   And then, 'cause we used to debate
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.640]   who was number one and number two.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.480]   You remember that?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.960]   - For real, for real.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.640]   I was only number one in the class and you was number two.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.760]   - Who used to win one-on-one?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.600]   Don't cap.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.080]   All right, if we not gonna cap.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.600]   All right, you got me.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.160]   But it's only 'cause of height difference, man.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.080]   You get to your spots and you just.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.000]   - I used to kill every one-on-one.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.600]   - Man, we gonna run it back now.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.400]   - But, so we gonna go,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.120]   we gonna transition to now college.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.120]   So you, so you did your thing in high school,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.920]   all of high school,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.240]   and then you go to college at Oklahoma.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.560]   Why did you pick Oklahoma?
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.920]   - Just being able to be me.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.480]   Like, for real, like just being able to go to a school.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.160]   Like, we were talking about that,
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.440]   like, picking our school, like we wanted to go places
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.960]   where we could be ourselves and be, I mean, just us.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.360]   And I had trust in Coach Kruger and the staff
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.640]   that they were telling me,
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.480]   everything that they told me was gonna come true.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.120]   And I mean, it kind of did.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.320]   I had my whole plan to be there two years, like.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.160]   - Yeah.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.000]   - Like.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.120]   - So you didn't even think you was gonna do
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.360]   what you did that first year?
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.800]   - I mean, I had thought it, but like,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.000]   for me, I didn't want to put the pressure on.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.840]   - Yeah.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.000]   - I didn't want myself to go in, like.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   Like, for you, it was different, you know what I'm saying?
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.720]   Like, you were gifted, bro.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.560]   Like, you had everything, you had everything.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.000]   Like, for me, I had to go, like,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.920]   I was thinking, like, two years, maybe.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.440]   And if it happened, it happened.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.640]   It happened the right way.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.160]   And so, it's a blessing, bro, but.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.480]   - Nah, it was crazy.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.440]   I used to always tell people, like, from knowing you,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.640]   when you're put in a situation where you can do your thing,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.360]   like, organization gives you the keys.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.840]   Whether that's Mocan, whether that's Oklahoma,
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.920]   whether that's, you know, the Atlanta Hawks,
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.520]   you're gonna be dominant.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.760]   But, like, when the team tries to put you in a box,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.880]   that's when you can't be Trey Young,
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.360]   and then you'll probably just be an average player.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.560]   'Cause I remember, we was playing Team USA,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.080]   and they had all these point guards ahead of you
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.520]   that they wanted the point guards just to distribute,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.880]   not really look for their own shot,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.760]   not shoot the deep threes or whatever.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760]   And you, like, you struggled in Team USA,
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.440]   and I used to, like, I just knew the whole time
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.080]   it was 'cause you weren't put in a situation
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.040]   where you could beat Trey.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.880]   - Yeah.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.720]   - But, like--
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.640]   - Yeah, nah, I don't know, it's like,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.200]   we was in our room talking about it.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.440]   Like, after games, like, I was hype, like, everything,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.320]   and we won, but remember how we was talking?
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.840]   Like, we've been talking about this stuff since then, so.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.320]   Nah, you right, like, if you put us in a box,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.200]   like, it's hard for us to really, to flourish.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.040]   - Right.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.120]   - For our skills to show.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.200]   - I'm glad we in situations now in the league
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.400]   where we can do our thing.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.680]   You've been doing it, you know,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.320]   I was just starting to kind of find my flow
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   with Nicola and Jamal, but, like, you,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.760]   from the moment you stepped in, you was balling.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.520]   - Yeah, you've been out with injury,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.120]   now you're getting back into it, you see it,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.200]   like, as I've been watching you play, like,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.800]   you're getting more, like, into it.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.640]   - Starting to get it.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.880]   - Yeah, you're starting to get into it,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.800]   you can see the confidence, like, everybody has in you,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.640]   like, they give you the rock, and it's,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.120]   the coach has in you, like, that just, it makes,
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   it brings the best out of you.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.720]   - Nah, I do, like, the, like, coaches,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.800]   man, like, the situation you're in plays such a key role
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.160]   into, like, who you can be as a player,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.680]   and that's why I tell people, like,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.040]   to talk about the league, like, my friends over there,
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.600]   but, like, there's so many cold players in the league
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.640]   that will never really be, like, who they could be
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.160]   just because of the situation, but, like,
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.120]   you go put 'em in, like, a run in the summertime,
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.200]   and they're gonna look amazing, you know what I'm saying?
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.040]   - Yeah.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.560]   - And there's so many players like that,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.400]   like, the one that comes to mind is Trey Van De Valk.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.360]   Like, remember how cold he was, like--
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.200]   - Trey was nice.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.920]   - Or, and then, like, he just doesn't,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.000]   hasn't really found the situation,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.640]   but there's so many players that's kind of like that,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.960]   like, they just don't find the situation,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.120]   so we're blessed, 'cause we're in good, good programs.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.560]   - Yeah, that's tough.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.840]   I was thinking Trey, who's another guy, like--
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.720]   - Billy, I think, Billy Preston.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.600]   I mean, he was one that, like, was cold in high school.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.520]   I don't know what he's doing now,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.280]   but, like, I always thought he'd be in the league.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   And then Kevin Knox is another one, I think,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.640]   who was real talented at high school.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.880]   He's in the league now in New York,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.040]   and, like, he hasn't really gotten the situation,
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.800]   the opportunity to be him, you know what I'm saying?
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.640]   - No.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.200]   - But there's countless players in the league that's like that.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.640]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.360]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.440]   Last thing about college, what's,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.080]   so the situation you was in,
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.960]   what's one piece of advice you would give to a freshman
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.000]   going into college that received as much attention as you,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.200]   but at the same time is trying to keep team chemistry?
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.760]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.920]   I mean, for me, it was tough.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.080]   Like, I had, like, 'cause I had a bunch of,
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.320]   I had a bunch of, like, older guys.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.040]   Like, I had a, it wasn't a bunch of young guys.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:28.880]   - The older team?
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.200]   - Yeah, it was more of an older team,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.280]   the team that the year before didn't do well,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.720]   they didn't make the tournament.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.960]   And then this team was supposed to be here,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.360]   and now you got an All-American coming in,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.640]   and it's like, and he's getting all the national attention,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.840]   and they're just right there.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.680]   So, you know what I'm saying?
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.920]   They saw a team, it's like,
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.840]   the only person I really had that was really close to me
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.480]   on the team was a couple of guys that were freshmen,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.120]   and then my roommate, Cam Augusti.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.080]   And then, besides that, it was all older guys,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.120]   and they kind of stuck together,
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.160]   and it was like, it was hard, it was hard.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.320]   For me, it was just, it's a learning thing,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.000]   a learning thing for me, just having to talk to guys,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.400]   and just make sure I keep it team.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.000]   - Step on toes, but still, at the same time,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.160]   let them know, nah, you're the man, this is my joint.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.520]   But y'all, I feel like that'd be so hard,
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.440]   that's why I asked the question,
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.120]   'cause I feel like, especially in college,
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.600]   you get them older dudes, and the freshmen coming in,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.400]   and he's by far the best player.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.200]   How do you keep that case?
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.880]   - Yeah, you just gotta just be yourself.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.040]   Like, don't ever let the national media,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.640]   and all that get to your head, and just make you change,
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.800]   'cause if you come in one way,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.520]   and then all this stuff comes at you,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.560]   and you're a different person, then they see that.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.600]   But if you're the same person from beginning to end,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.120]   they see that too, and I think that's something that,
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.480]   I mean, I didn't struggle with,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.400]   but it was just, as far as changing myself,
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.920]   but it was just like a situation where,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   I mean, I think it was good,
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.240]   but I just had to learn, and learn that on my own.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   - Right, 'cause looking in, like y'all,
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.280]   look from the outside, y'all was good,
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.920]   but y'all, like, I just wondered that,
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.120]   like y'all were really good,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.720]   but I didn't know if y'all could be better,
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.880]   if the chemistry was better,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.840]   'cause y'all were like what, like top five for a second,
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.760]   then y'all start losing.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.880]   - Yeah, we got all the way up to number three in the country.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.400]   - Then why y'all start losing?
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.000]   - We started seeing teams twice in the Big 12.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.840]   - Oh, for real?
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.600]   - So the second time, teams--
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.440]   - They figured y'all out?
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.240]   - Yeah, they weren't double-teaming me,
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.000]   and doing all this stuff, it was, it was, I don't know.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.040]   - But let's talk to the league then, bro.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.920]   So you, so you in the league now,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.880]   your first year you did really, really good,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   your second year you're an all-star,
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.720]   and then, so like now, from now on,
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.560]   people kind of view you as like,
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.120]   oh, he's supposed to be an all-star,
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.360]   from here on out, like,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.960]   and that was your second year in the NBA,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.840]   and people expect you to play at this all-star level,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.160]   which I feel like you should've been an all-star this year,
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.840]   like, like, no question.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.680]   But how do you, my question for you is,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.040]   how do you deal with, like, the expectations now,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.520]   going forward, and just now putting that pressure
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.000]   on yourself, but at the same time, like,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.840]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, for me, it's,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.080]   I, like, you just can't worry about it.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.400]   Like, you just, for me, I've gotten to the point now
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.760]   where, like, I don't, I don't care about
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.400]   other people's expectations on me.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.480]   Like, my expectations of myself are higher
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.440]   than anybody else's could be, so it's like,
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.120]   I mean, nothing they say is gonna make me feel
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.600]   some type of way when anybody else puts on me,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.160]   like, I'm, I know what I, what I want,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.000]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.840]   Like, I know-- - And it's higher
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.520]   than anybody else could expect from you, anyways.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.720]   - Yeah, yeah, so that's, that's how I'm just,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   that's how I go about it, that's how I think.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.400]   - Yeah, I feel like, like, a lot of young players,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.120]   especially, but I know, like, me and you used to,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.160]   me and you used to struggle with this, too,
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.600]   'cause we'd look up our name on Twitter,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.800]   see people talking about, like, as young players,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.720]   you tend to want to, like, you play a lot of times
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.760]   with the approval of other people,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.880]   like, you want them to talk good about you,
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.240]   you want people to, you know,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.160]   approve of how you're playing, whatever,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.280]   and then, like, if you're not meeting that,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.600]   it can really, like, weigh on you,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.080]   but then as you get older, and you get to the NBA,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.560]   you see there's so many games,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.160]   there's so many highs and lows,
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.040]   then you kind of learn, like, okay,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.600]   I'm not playing for the fans, I'm not playing for,
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.240]   for the approval of other people,
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.520]   I'm just playing 'cause I love the game,
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.080]   and because, like, I want to be the best I can be,
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.760]   and then that kind of lets you play free,
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.720]   and I know you, like, you be playing so free out there,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.840]   so I know you kind of have a mindset of, like,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.240]   you're not worried about what other people are saying.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   - Yeah, but it took me a while to get to this point,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.080]   like, and I think it's tough,
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.240]   'cause our generation is, like,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.880]   is the first generation that's really going through this,
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.040]   'cause, like, the older people, like, I mean--
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.160]   - They ain't got no social media.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.400]   - They ain't got no social media,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.360]   this is new to them, like, they're, like,
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.840]   like, a lot of the older guys in the league,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.720]   like, they're, they didn't have to go from college,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.560]   and you're on your Twitter all the, like, in high school,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.760]   and, like, we've been doing this since high school,
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.120]   like, and so, like, to be able to do that
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.280]   through high school and college,
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.920]   and then know when you get to the NBA
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.840]   that all that doesn't matter,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.760]   and, like, all that looking for approval,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.920]   like you said, like, that stuff doesn't matter,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.480]   like, it's hard to, like, shut that off,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.600]   but once you, if you understand that as an early,
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.480]   like, at an early age, I think that can help you,
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.480]   I mean, like you said, the better you're gonna be.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.240]   - Yeah, no facts, and I think, like,
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.360]   I be saying, like, humans in general,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.800]   people view NBA players like we're not really human,
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.880]   like, we don't have emotions,
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.160]   we don't see certain stuff on social media,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.040]   and I be saying, like, no human is supposed
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.680]   to experience that much praise,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.040]   and no human is supposed to experience that much, like, hate,
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.880]   like, if you have a good game or a bad game,
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.280]   you know, like, the way that fans talk about you
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.200]   is just crazy, and social media obviously plays, like,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.280]   the biggest part into it, 'cause they just,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.920]   it's easy for them to just comment
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.360]   whatever they want on your picture,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.520]   but, like, but like you said, like, no one,
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.200]   the generation before didn't have to deal with that,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.880]   we received so much, like, praise,
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.160]   which I feel like can be a bad thing,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.880]   'cause it gets people's head too big,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.960]   and they start changing it,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.000]   and they start playing for that praise,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.040]   but then also, like, the criticism that we be getting,
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.920]   like, if we don't meet people's expectations is crazy,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.760]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.000]   - Nah, nah, that's, that's crazy, bro, nah.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.800]   - It's wild, bro.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.440]   - I can go on there for days talking about, like.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.800]   - Nah, say something about it then,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.600]   like, how you be feeling, how you be feeling about that?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.280]   - I mean, for me, like, I don't,
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.760]   like, I just, I don't talk about,
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   I don't, for me, it took a while to really get away from,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.240]   like, not caring about other people's approval,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.080]   like, you know what I'm saying?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.880]   Like, my, I don't, I don't know,
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.760]   like, I literally have a, excuse my language,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   not-give-a-fuck, like, motto, like, that's just,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.640]   I just don't, like, I just, like,
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.000]   unless it's important to me, like,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.120]   if you can't help me, or, like,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.920]   you're not benefiting, like, helping me,
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.280]   or my family, or whatever, like,
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.400]   it's, I don't care about your opinion, like.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.560]   - Yeah, like, yeah, who are you to be,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.920]   all these people talking, stuff, like,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.480]   you never even gonna meet 'em,
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.920]   and they don't even care about you,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.760]   like, you know what I'm saying?
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.440]   And that thing, I realized, like, bro,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.120]   you can be as good, you can be the best player in the NBA,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.960]   and have everything, and then, like,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.800]   if you have a bad game,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.120]   they still gonna talk crazy about you.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.080]   - Yeah. - You know what I'm saying?
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.400]   So, if you, if you feed into that, bro, like,
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.040]   your emotions are gonna be on such a rollercoaster,
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.400]   'cause you can never live up to what people want,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.560]   people want perfection, like, fans want perfection.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.000]   - And you seen guys, you seen guys in the league go, like,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.240]   leave the league, 'cause they just,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.920]   they're so mentally, like.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.760]   - Yeah, they don't know how to deal with the pressure.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.400]   - The pressure is tough, and it's like,
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.160]   some of you, it's a real thing,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.400]   like a real struggle people have.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.480]   - It's a real struggle, and I just,
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.880]   I think, like, what really makes, like,
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.040]   the best the best, the more I'm thinking about it,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.720]   is not, like, how people handle, like, the praise,
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.760]   but it's almost, like, how people can bounce back
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.480]   from the bad games, or the criticism,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.400]   and they get right back on their, like, what they do.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   Like, you know, we've been talking,
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.440]   we've both been talking to Brett, you know,
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.920]   our mental strength guy, help us out with that stuff,
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.960]   but he was just telling me the other day,
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.120]   like, Tiger Woods, like, he's won, like,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.320]   he's lost way more matches than he's won,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.080]   but he's still considered the best ever,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.200]   and it's got me thinking, like,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.320]   what really, like, separates the greatest
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.480]   is really how they handle, like, losses,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.320]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.160]   - Yeah.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.360]   - So I think, like, and for me, really,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.880]   that's why I kind of get off social media,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.760]   because, like, it's easier to stay locked in
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.960]   and not really care what people think
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.400]   when you're not getting all the comments,
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.120]   and not getting all the whatever.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.520]   There's other reasons, too.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   You know, the female, but that's a big reason, so.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.240]   Yeah, bro, like, I was gonna ask you, too,
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.280]   so especially this year, like, in general,
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.880]   like, from the outside looking in,
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.040]   it's been a lot of talk about the way you draw fouls.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.160]   You know, Steve Nash said he wasn't playing basketball
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.480]   or whatever, but to me, it's like,
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.240]   you're utilizing the rules of the game.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.640]   You're doing what they're giving you,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.120]   and, like, in the past, when players have figured out
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.920]   the game and figured out how to, like,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.800]   take advantage of it, then it can cause, like,
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.680]   people, them to change the rules or whatever,
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.640]   but that's not the player's fault.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.680]   That's being smart and having a good IQ.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.040]   So what do you think about, like,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.760]   people criticizing you, like, especially this year?
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.320]   - Yeah, I mean, especially with the foul drawing,
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.960]   like, I'm just, it's kind of frustrating.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.840]   I mean, Steve brought up, like,
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.240]   how smart I am at drawing fouls.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.440]   Like, how good I am at drawing fouls.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.400]   Like, the media took the "that's not basketball"
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.480]   and just blew it up.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.120]   Like, I was kind of frustrated at first when I saw it,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.920]   but then I saw the whole quote and I saw what he said,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.800]   but, like, me drawing fouls, like, that's just--
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.760]   - That's smart.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.600]   - It's just smart.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.840]   - Like, I don't see why people would get mad at you,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.200]   and why they, I see why people might get mad at the rules.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.040]   Like, if you, like--
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.920]   - Don't blame me, like, blame the rules.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.160]   - That's just being smart, like, you just,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.600]   that's being smart, like, if you,
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.360]   if they want to change the rules,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.280]   make it so, like, if you pump fake
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.920]   and then you jump into someone,
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.880]   that's not a foul, or it's an offensive foul,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.280]   but don't get mad at someone, like, utilizing the rules.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.920]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm just, that's the thing.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   Like, I'm not doing anything that the rules
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.800]   aren't saying I can't do.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.480]   - Right, exactly.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.880]   - I'm just, like, if a dude, and the thing is,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.040]   is, like, people already hate that
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.880]   a smaller guy like me is, is, like,
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.240]   doing what I'm doing, and so, like,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.560]   they're gonna try to be physical,
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.720]   and try to be, like, the thing that,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.040]   I know what, like, the game plan against me is,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.080]   be physical, be rough 'em up, like--
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.280]   - So you learn how to use--
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.920]   - So I'm just learning how to,
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.600]   when they go, "Okay, you wanna bump me?
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.640]   "All right, let's just, let me go off the screen.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.720]   "I know you gonna bump me, so I'm just gonna stop
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.480]   "and just let you keep running," right?
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.320]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.400]   Like, there's little things that I just,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.680]   I'm gonna, like, especially when my starting stops,
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.360]   like, like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go off the screen,
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.440]   I'll go full speed, and the natural things,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.880]   if I stop, your momentum is still going.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.120]   Like, you still--
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.960]   - You gonna hit your--
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.800]   - You gonna hit me regardless.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.880]   - It's gonna be a foul, and that's,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.400]   that is a foul, like, that's, that's smart.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.240]   - Yeah.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.080]   - Now, that had me tripping, too.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.160]   Like, how people gonna get mad at you
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.920]   for, for being a smart player?
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.480]   - It's, it's, it is what it is nowadays.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.440]   That's what I'm talking about when it comes to social media.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.120]   It's like, like, now, it's like,
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.680]   I don't, I don't like that.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.520]   Like, I don't care about that no more.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.680]   - Yeah, you don't care about none of that.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.080]   - Like, I don't care about that no more.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.760]   Like, maybe back a couple years ago,
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.800]   like, when I'm in college, and rookie year,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.360]   like, that stuff fazed me, but it don't anymore.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.240]   - So, criticism, like, you would say you don't care,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.880]   or did, like, some people could use it to make 'em better,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.400]   or some people use it, and then they follow it,
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.200]   and they don't know what to do with criticism.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.720]   Do you, you just don't care about it at all,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.880]   or do you feel like it make you better?
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.800]   - I, I think it's, I think you pick and choose.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.880]   I think you, you, you hear every--
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.200]   - You start the criticism, you hear it?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.440]   - You hear everything, you know what I'm saying?
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.360]   Like, I hear everything, you know what I'm saying?
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.760]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick and choose what I let,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.080]   I mean, let inside, and let it affect me,
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.760]   and what I don't, you know what I'm saying, so.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.320]   - That's, I mean, bro, that's what separates you,
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.360]   'cause I'm, like, a lot of players can't do that,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   especially with the attention, and, you know,
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.280]   the criticism, and, like, the love,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.880]   and the hate that you receive.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.760]   Like, a lot of players can't do that.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.420]   How would you say the NBA is different,
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.920]   on the court, and off the court,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.520]   than, like, college or high school?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.360]   - Shh.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   I mean...
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.880]   - On the, we'll start with on the court.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.960]   Like, how, how is the game different?
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.560]   - On the court, I mean, it's just the spacing.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.440]   - Yeah. - Like, the spacing.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.760]   Like, I look at college games now, and, like--
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.600]   - It's hard to watch.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.800]   - It's hard to watch, just 'cause, like,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.760]   the defensive three safeties, like,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.640]   the fact that somebody can sit in the lane,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.040]   and you can't-- - Yeah.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.480]   - You can't drive, and all that stuff, that's,
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.400]   it's hard to watch, and I think that's
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.040]   the most frustrating thing about the college game,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.960]   and the difference from that in the NBA is the spacing,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.360]   and the fact that everybody can hoop, like--
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.200]   - In the league?
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.440]   - Everybody, yeah. - Like, there's no weak link,
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.800]   but if you leave a player open,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   he probably gonna make a shot,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.360]   even if he's the 12th man on the bench.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.520]   - Yeah. - He's still called.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.960]   - Still good, so, I think that's the difference.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.240]   And then, off the court, it's like,
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.800]   I don't know, it's like,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.400]   you don't have to worry about anything.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.800]   - You got the bread, you got the money,
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.120]   you can do what you want.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.400]   - Yeah, it's more about treating this like,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   it's basically, you get the option of treating basketball
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.320]   how you want it, you know what I'm saying?
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.960]   It's like, you have everything,
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.520]   so you have this time after basketball,
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.920]   like, you get to pick, you wanna--
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.760]   - You get to pick what, yeah,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.800]   you get to pick what you wanna do.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.880]   - You wanna, you wanna, how good you wanna be--
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.400]   - You wanna lock in, and use your money,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.440]   like, to buy a chef, to help your body, or whatever,
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.000]   or do you wanna use your money to fly five girls out
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.760]   to the crib, or go out and, you know?
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.600]   - Yeah, spending all the money in bottles and stuff,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.960]   and do all that, or you can do,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   or you can spend that money on, like you said, a chef,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.880]   like, so it's, that's really the difference.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.240]   - It's like, the difference almost then is like,
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.640]   whatever you dreamed that you could do
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.800]   in high school or college, now you can actually do.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.640]   - Yeah. - That's why a lot of people
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.040]   get in the league, then they fall off,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.840]   'cause they have the world in their hands,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.000]   and they don't stay locked.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.360]   Like, their whole goal, I think one of the biggest,
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.600]   like, differences between players
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.680]   that really, like, become really good,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.920]   and players that just get to the league
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.280]   and kind of fizzle out, is like, what was your goal?
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.920]   Like, was your goal just to make the NBA,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.800]   and then you just wanted to live the lifestyle,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.320]   or was your goal to be, like, one of the best players,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.000]   and, like, really, like, you really love basketball?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.280]   You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.200]   It's definitely a difference of mindsets, whatever,
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.800]   of guys, you can tell, like, as you start playing,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.760]   or what guys really focus on, too, yeah.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.280]   - What do you think is the next step for you,
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.760]   and your game, to become, like,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.240]   the player you ultimately could become?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.840]   - Um, I think, for me, I think, for me,
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.160]   it's all just about winning, you know what I'm saying?
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.240]   Like, I mean, I'm always gonna be,
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.280]   I mean, I've done a lot of things a couple years already,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.640]   but, I mean, all the individual stuff is gonna come,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.960]   and, like, I think I'm always,
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.480]   one thing I've always took from Coach P
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.160]   is winning takes care of everything.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.560]   - Back, and if you win, everybody gonna eat.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.400]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.800]   So, like, winning, I know, for me,
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.360]   like, all the individual stuff, like, all that,
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.760]   all that stuff's gonna come, like,
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.840]   it's, for me, like, to be looked at,
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.280]   like, looked at different.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.200]   - As a winner.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.560]   - I wanna be looked at as a winner, so that's why.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.160]   - Like, CP3, like, now, at this point in his career,
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.680]   everywhere he go, like, his reputation now
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.800]   is he's just a winner.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.640]   - Yeah.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.600]   - He can go to any organization.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.400]   - Just stick around the league for years doing that.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.080]   - Turn it around, yeah.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.160]   - So, I feel that.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.760]   What do you, so, how are you gonna spend your off-seasons?
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.920]   Or what do you like to do, outside of hoop?
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:11.160]   - I like being, I like being with my close people,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.200]   friends, family, I mean, vacation, I mean, I play.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.320]   Blackjacks, I don't know.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.160]   - I feel that.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.640]   - We'll be in Vegas.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.800]   - We definitely gonna be in Vegas on the roulette, for sure.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.640]   - Oh, yeah, okay.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.960]   - Or, where did we go, Bahamas?
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.800]   - Yeah, Bahamas.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.240]   - We was on the roulette, losing crazy, bro.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.720]   (laughing)
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.440]   We didn't even go to the beach for real, bro.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.480]   We was in the casino the whole time.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.640]   - Yes, fam.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.720]   All right, this is my last question for you.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.600]   What would you say is your,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.240]   what do you view as your purpose?
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.720]   Like, what's your purpose?
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   - Oh, my purpose is, my purpose is just making sure,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.960]   making sure my family is good.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:04.920]   And then, also inspiring the next generation,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.040]   and making sure the game is better than it's left.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.840]   I mean, for me, I get frustrated sometimes
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   at the older players, not understanding that the game,
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.280]   it's okay if the game is better today.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.120]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.960]   - Maybe, yeah.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.680]   - Like, it's because of y'all.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.920]   Like, the game, y'all made the game better,
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.560]   and, or whatever.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.520]   And so, now it's LeBron came in from Jordan,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.480]   then Steph came in and changed the game.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.080]   Like, the game gets better over time.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.760]   So, for me, I just wanna be one of those guys,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.640]   hopefully, that makes the game a little bit better,
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.160]   and inspire others.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.760]   - Inspire others.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.680]   That's dope, bro.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.600]   Well, I appreciate you coming on this joint.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.760]   This is dope, fam.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.000]   My guy.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.400]   - What's the show called again?
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.880]   - Curious Mike.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.960]   - Curious Mike.

[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.960]   - This episode was sponsored by Lemon Perfect.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.540]   (upbeat music)
