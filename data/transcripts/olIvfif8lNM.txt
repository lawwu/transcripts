[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.420]   - My guy, Trey in the building.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.800]   What's good with you, fam?
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.160]   - My guy.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.720]   Sir, what's good, guy?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.560]   - All right, bro.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.380]   So let's get it poppin'.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.880]   So first I wanna start off at high school.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.240]   Do you remember how we met?
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.960]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.280]   Nike Elite, what is it?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   - You know, at the top of Hunter Camp?
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.400]   - You know, in St. Louis.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.920]   - Yeah, I remember 'cause I remember
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.800]   seeing this light-skinned dude.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.880]   And he was like, you was like what, like five?
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.560]   You was like five, what are you like?
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.880]   - Probably like five, six.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.760]   - And he was just gettin' buckets, you know?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040]   - No, no, no, no, no, I was like probably 10.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.720]   - But everybody was at that camp.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.000]   And that's when I first met you.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.360]   And then we, and then the time when we,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840]   the time I really remember was we was at that gym
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.740]   with Mo Can, you walked in the door.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.700]   Coach Perry was like, man, it's this kid comin'.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.000]   He's like the best point guard in the area.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.880]   And I had no idea who it was, and you walked in the door.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.040]   And I was like, man, this dude, I remember this dude.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.760]   But I didn't remember you being that good from the camp.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.560]   And then we had a practice or whatever,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.040]   and you was like, you was killin', like,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   same game you have now, you was doin' your thing.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.400]   And then that's when we linked up.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.960]   - No, for real, I remember that 'cause that was
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.800]   right after, 'cause that was my first time
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.040]   goin' to practice, goin' to Kansas City.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.160]   I think that was the first time we actually linked
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   after game 100 was that practice was great.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.240]   - Yeah, how did you even, what made you wanna
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.680]   play with Mo Can, though?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.400]   - Reason why I came over to Mo Can,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.320]   Coach P hit me up, Matt Souther,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.200]   told me I was able to come play with you.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.000]   I was playin' in Dallas, and our team wouldn't really like that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.800]   - Oh, I didn't know.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   - I was tryin' to play on the 17U level,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.440]   and then I was tryin' to come over to Nike
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.520]   and play with Mo Can.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.880]   So they gave me the opportunity to play with you,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.520]   so I was like.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.360]   - It was great.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200]   - Yeah.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.400]   - I mean, for the jump, we had like a crazy chemistry,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.760]   like, from the jump.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.120]   And that was our 16s, and we was playin' up 17s, I think.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.360]   - Yeah, it made it easy 'cause we were both young,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.400]   and we were outta town, and we,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.920]   remember we had to stay over at Coach Dave's
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   house all the time?
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   - Yeah, Coach Dave's.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.360]   - So we had a lot of time, we was just in the basement,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.480]   chillin', watchin' games.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.040]   - So that's when we, yeah, that's when we first
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.200]   got real close, we was tryin' to sneak out the crib.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.040]   - Yeah.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.880]   (laughing)
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.640]   - Yeah, I remember that, so.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120]   And then, so that 16s year, we had that year,
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   and we made PGM, we ended up losin' the pool play, right?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.920]   - Yeah, we, I don't even think we won two games.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   - I think we won two out of three.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.200]   - Yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.680]   - And then we was like, but we knew we had the potential
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.640]   to be like, cold.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   - And so, we knew we was gonna come back that next year,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   and then 17s, we came back, and we was dominant.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.120]   I think we lost, what, one game?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.960]   Two games?
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   - Yeah, two games all season.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.320]   - Which one do you think we should watch,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.200]   this one or this one?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   - Nah, bro, the PGM one, bro.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.560]   - This one?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.400]   I ain't seen it.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.520]   We was so tough, bro.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.800]   - Okay, first play of the game was good.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.840]   - That was the first play of the game.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.140]   - Our whole class is pretty much in the lead.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.960]   - Yeah, we were.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.020]   Good, Tae.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.200]   - Lay.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   - Good, Tae.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.980]   Oh, look at you in there.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.800]   - Yeah, we was getting too hyped, yo.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.300]   First half, we were all right.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   Hey, he was not missing, though.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.720]   - Jarrett, where?
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.380]   - That whole PGM?
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.880]   - I know, bro.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.340]   I mean, I be telling people we was, like,
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.220]   the best AU program ever, like, ever.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.940]   - Yeah, I mean, we in the conversation, for sure.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.020]   I think we, I can't argue with my friends all the time,
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.220]   like, players, they always talk about the AU team.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.860]   Like, I don't see a team that can match up with us.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.140]   - Nah, 'cause it was like, we went to PGM,
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.380]   and it wasn't like we was winning by two or 10 or whatever.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.900]   We was winning by, like, 30.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.740]   - Every game.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.700]   - Every game.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.520]   - So, what was your favorite memories, would you say,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.700]   from that whole, from that whole, like,
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.960]   AU side of, side of thing?
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.180]   - I think, really, just what we were just talking about,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.460]   like, the time when we were going
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.500]   and having those three days on Saturdays,
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.380]   and, like, throughout the day,
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.980]   we're always kicking it with each other.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.020]   Like, me and you, with the team, like,
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.060]   we're either going to watch other games,
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.180]   or we're at the crib, or we're doing something.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.380]   Like, we're always with each other.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.900]   - We were always together, every weekend,
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.740]   and I'm up there.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.580]   - Every weekend.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.540]   So, for us, out of state, like, we were always,
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.620]   me and you were always together,
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.980]   'cause we didn't have nowhere else to go.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.340]   Like, I mean, your parents were always busy,
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.260]   like, your family, mine, same way.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.820]   Like, they're doing their stuff,
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.100]   so we were always with each other.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.620]   So, that's what I think, why we were so close.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.660]   - We got close.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.900]   - Crazy.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.660]   - We went, remember, we was trying to make college work, too.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.500]   - Yeah.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.320]   - Trying to make the college thing work,
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.540]   but we could never get it to happen.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.260]   What was your favorite camp we did?
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.100]   Like, any of that?
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.340]   We did so much, we did Chile, the two USA, the...
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.300]   - You think NBA Top 100 was fun?
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.540]   - I thought it was, it was fun.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.860]   It was like, it was informative,
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.380]   'cause we'd hoop, and we'd have the class stuff.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.220]   - Yeah.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.300]   - And everybody was there, though.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.140]   That's what I like about it.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.980]   Every good player was there.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.380]   - That's what I think about it, yeah.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.020]   - But it was cool, you was killing.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.500]   That's really like when you took a leap.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.780]   That, I remember seeing that video,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.820]   I think it was A Baller's Life,
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.340]   that came out of you and Gary going back and forth.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.740]   - Oh yeah, me and Gary went back, yeah.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.580]   - Yeah, that was crazy.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.100]   - No, that was cool, that was cool.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.100]   We had a, yeah, USA, that was just a long, a long trip.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.340]   - Bro, they kept trying to make you say, "Thank you."
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.180]   Remember?
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.420]   (laughing)
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.620]   - Look, you're not allowed to say thank you.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.580]   (laughing)
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.340]   - Bro, I was, bro, I was good like man.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.100]   - Oh wait, that's my teammate now.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.300]   - Who?
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.140]   Who?
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.220]   - Oh yeah, I'm here.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.780]   - Oh yeah, is he, is he playing?
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.620]   - I don't know.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.540]   - Yeah, he's playing a little bit.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.460]   - They were really tripping on saying, "Thank you."
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.420]   - No, that's, it was for the assist.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.260]   - I know.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.100]   - To the mic.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.940]   - Hey.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.780]   - Look, you gotta say it.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.380]   Look, I know you didn't say it.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.940]   (laughing)
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.980]   I knew it, I already knew it.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.740]   - USA was crazy, but the food they gave us was so weak.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.580]   Hey.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.060]   - Look, no you didn't say it.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.820]   (laughing)
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.380]   You didn't say it.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.180]   You didn't say it in fast enough.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.500]   - Bro, that is.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   - They was tripping on that too.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.540]   You had to say it like.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.140]   - I mean, that was the thing, if you was throwing,
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.060]   you had to be the USA, you know what I'm saying?
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.900]   - You were MVP.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.220]   - Yeah, nah, I remember, I don't know.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.540]   - I was back there, Matt Coleman.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.620]   'Cause we had like, it was like, we had a camp,
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.940]   and then we went to Team Europe.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.540]   No, we had Peach Jam, I think.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.940]   And then we went to some camp.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.540]   And then we did Chile.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.140]   And then we went to another Nike camp.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.820]   We was with each other for like a month.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.820]   And like, people, we got so tired of each other.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.140]   Me and this dude got so tired of each other.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.660]   And I remember we was in Chile, and Chile was so crazy.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.500]   Is that how you pronounce it, Chile?
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.820]   - Chile, yeah.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.700]   - We was up there, and we had been with each other
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.220]   for like a month, and then we was like,
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.620]   rooming together the whole time.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.140]   We was so tired of each other.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.860]   And I think that's the only time we really got
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.300]   to like, a real, like, fight.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.020]   We got to like, an argument, you remember that?
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.260]   - Yeah, we were in LA though.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.740]   We were at the Skills Academy.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.740]   - That's when we got in a fight?
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.460]   - Yeah, that was the last place.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.540]   - That was the last place, we was so tired of each other.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.740]   - It was all, all because I was on FaceTime,
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.820]   and he wanted me to turn off the lights.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.740]   - So this is what happened.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.860]   So we had been with each other for like a month,
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.900]   and I'm tired, I'm trying to go to sleep.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.540]   This dude on FaceTime with his girl,
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.260]   and I'm like, "Bro, turn the light off."
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.100]   But he had the light on.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.220]   I'm like, "Bro, you can't FaceTime with the light off."
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.580]   He's like, "Nah, bro, I want the light on."
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.700]   So I get up out of my bed, and I go, "Turn the light off."
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.020]   Soon as I get back from my bed,
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.180]   he turned the light back on, I'm like, "Bro."
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.100]   So I get back up, turn the light off.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.860]   He turned it back on again, and then like,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.380]   literally we both just was so like, irritated with each other,
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.340]   we started fighting, like, actually like, fighting.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.820]   - For real, for real.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.340]   - I think, yeah, I got a picture somewhere, but.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.180]   - I do remember that.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.860]   - That was.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.740]   - Hey, you was, it was a trip, bro.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.900]   - No, that was fun, though.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.460]   - But going, like, from high school,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.220]   so you was ranked like, I think like in the 20 to 30 range.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.060]   But like, every player you played against
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.500]   in your position, you was killing.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.340]   - Yeah.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.780]   - But they still had you ranked, so like,
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.940]   so they didn't have you ranked, like, high enough.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.060]   Why do you think that was?
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.140]   Like, what were people tripping about with you,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.820]   and what was the, like, criticism you got in high school?
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.780]   - I think it was just more like, just my,
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.540]   just my, nobody really thought that my game
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.620]   would translate to the next level, I think.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.380]   And for me, it was just about showing it.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.900]   I think once I got to college, and played on TV,
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.260]   and played in front of all these people,
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.860]   like, my game, you know this,
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.140]   like, my game hasn't really changed since high school.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.100]   So it's like, it's really just since,
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.180]   once I got on a national stage,
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.140]   and played in front of more people, more eyes,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.940]   more people saw my game and could translate.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.260]   So that's really what it was.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.340]   And I think it was just people,
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.140]   and you know, people can, people can boost,
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.900]   and like, you should've been number one player
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.860]   in high school.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.700]   - Yeah.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.580]   - For the longest, but it's like,
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.740]   everything is, it's all politics, like,
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.580]   it's all politics.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.500]   - It's all, and they'll find something, like,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.180]   if they don't, and it's so crazy,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.940]   'cause they'll judge these kids,
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.580]   but like, look at what you're doing right now.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.020]   Like, they wasn't looking at what you was doing right now.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.220]   Every matchup you had against another good point guard,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.260]   you was killing 'em.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.780]   So, but they was basing everything off of potential.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.620]   - Yeah.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.060]   - But like, that's what I don't get about, like,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.980]   some of these rankers, or analysts, or whatever.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.940]   Like, you're doing the same exact thing.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.900]   Your game hasn't changed.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.780]   I remember one of the things they said was like,
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.300]   they didn't think you was athletic enough,
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.420]   or couldn't get your shot off at the next level.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.380]   But like, athleticism is more than just having balance.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.340]   Like, you ain't got no balance,
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.340]   but you got, like, every other athleticism you have.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.180]   Like, you're quick,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.620]   you're one of the fastest players in the league.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.820]   Like, and you get your shot off whenever you want.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.380]   Your body control is crazy,
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.060]   and that's like, they was missing that.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.740]   But like, we always knew that you was like,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.900]   and I used to always tell you,
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.620]   like, you're the number one point guard.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.500]   And then, 'cause we used to debate
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.660]   who was number one and number two.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.500]   You remember that?
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.980]   - For real, for real.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.460]   I was always number one in the class,
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.660]   and you was number two.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.780]   - Who used to win one-on-one?
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.620]   Don't cap.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.260]   All right, if we're not gonna cap.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.620]   All right, you got me,
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.180]   but it don't give the height difference, man.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.100]   You get to your spots, and you just...
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.860]   - I used to kill every one-on-one.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.620]   - Man, we gonna run it back now.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.420]   - But, so we gonna go,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.140]   we gonna transition to now college.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.140]   So you do your thing in high school,
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.940]   all of high school,
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.260]   and then you go to college at Oklahoma.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.620]   Why did you pick Oklahoma?
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.940]   - Just being able to be me.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.500]   Like, for real, like, just being able to go to a school.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.220]   Like, we were talking about that,
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.460]   like, picking our school.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.620]   We wanted to go to places where we could be ourselves
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.060]   and be, I mean, just us.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.420]   And I had trust in Coach Krueger and the staff
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.700]   that they were telling me,
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.580]   everything that they told me was gonna come true.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.220]   And, I mean, it kind of did.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.420]   My whole plan was to be there two years.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.740]   - Yeah.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.180]   So you didn't even think you was gonna do
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.420]   what you did that first year?
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.900]   - I mean, I had thought it, but like,
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.820]   for me, I didn't want to put the pressure on myself
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.700]   to go in, like, for you, it was different.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.540]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.780]   Like, you were gifted, bro.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.620]   Like, you had everything, you had everything.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.020]   Like, for me, I had to go, like,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.940]   I was thinking, like, two years maybe.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.460]   And if it happened, it happened.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.660]   It happened the right way.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.180]   And so, it's a blessing, bro.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.500]   - Nah, it was crazy.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.260]   I used to always tell people, like,
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.540]   from knowing you, when you're put in a situation
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.060]   where you can do your thing and, like,
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.380]   an organization gives you the keys,
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.900]   whether that's MoCan, whether that's Oklahoma,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.980]   whether that's, you know, the Atlanta Hawks,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.540]   you're gonna be dominant.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.780]   But, like, when the team tries to put you in a box,
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.940]   that's when you can't be Trey Young,
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.380]   and then you'll probably just be an average player.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.620]   'Cause I remember, we was playing Team USA,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.100]   and they had all these point guards ahead of you
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.580]   that they wanted the point guards just to distribute,
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.900]   not really look for their own shot,
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.780]   not shoot the deep threes or whatever.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.780]   And you, like, you struggled in Team USA.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.460]   And I used to, like, I just knew the whole time
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.060]   it was 'cause you weren't put in a situation
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.020]   where you could beat Trey.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.860]   - Yeah.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.700]   - But, like--
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.540]   - Yeah, nah, you--
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.180]   Nah, I know, it's like, we was in our room talking about it.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.420]   Like, after games, like, I was hyped, like, everything,
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.300]   and we won, but remember how we was talking?
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.900]   Like, we've been talking about this stuff since then.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.300]   So, nah, you right, like, if you put us in a box,
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.180]   like, it's hard for us to really, to flourish.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.020]   - Right.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.100]   - For our skills to show.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.180]   - I'm glad we in situations now in the league
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.420]   where we can do our thing.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.660]   You've been doing it, you know,
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.340]   I was just starting to kind of find my flow
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.340]   with Nicola and Jamal, but, like, you,
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.780]   from the moment you stepped in, you was balling.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.540]   - Yeah, you've been out with injury.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.700]   Now you're getting back into it.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.100]   You see it, like, as I've been watching you play.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.740]   Like, you're getting more, like, into it.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.580]   - Starting to get into it.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.900]   - Yeah, you starting to get into it.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.820]   You can see the confidence, like, everybody has in you.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.700]   Like, they give you the rock, and it's,
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.140]   the coach has in you, like, that just, it makes,
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.140]   it brings the best out of you.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.580]   - Nah, dude, like, the, like,
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.740]   coaches, man, like, the situation you're in
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.220]   plays such a key role into, like,
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.180]   who you can be as a player.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.660]   And that's why I tell people, like,
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.100]   to talk about the league.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.260]   Like, my friends over there, but, like,
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.620]   there's so many cold players in the league
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.020]   that will never really be, like,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.900]   who they could be just because of the situation.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.580]   But, like, you go put 'em in, like, a,
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.100]   like, a run in the summertime,
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.700]   and they'll, they're gonna look amazing.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.860]   You know what I'm saying? - Yeah.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.580]   - And there's so many players like that.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.420]   Like, the one that comes to mind is Trayvon Duvall.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.780]   Like, remember how cold he was?
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.260]   Like-- - Trayvon was nice.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.980]   - Or, and then, like, he just doesn't,
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.060]   hasn't really found a situation.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.700]   But there's so many players that's kind of like that.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.980]   Like, they just don't find a situation.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.620]   So we're blessed, 'cause-- - Yeah.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.100]   - We're in good, good programs.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.580]   - Yeah, that's tough.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.900]   I was thinking Trayvon, who's another guy, like?
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.140]   - Billy, I think. - Billy?
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:30.980]   - Billy Preston.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.620]   I mean, he's one that, like, was cold in high school.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.580]   I don't know what he's doing now,
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.340]   but, like, I always thought he'd be in the league.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.300]   And then Kevin Knox is another one, I think,
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.700]   who was real talented at high school.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.900]   He's in the league now in New York,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.100]   and, like, he hasn't really gotten the situation,
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.780]   the opportunity to be him.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.700]   You know what I'm saying? - He's there, yeah.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.580]   - But there's countless players in the league
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.700]   that's like that. - Yeah, I agree.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.380]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.460]   Last thing about college, what's,
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.100]   so the situation you was in,
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.780]   what's one piece of advice you would give
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.300]   to a freshman going into college
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.020]   that received as much attention as you,
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.220]   but at the same time is trying to keep team chemistry?
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.740]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.900]   I mean, for me, it was tough.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.100]   Like, I had, like, 'cause I had a bunch of,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.300]   I had a bunch of, like, older guys.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.020]   Like, I had a, it wasn't a bunch of young guys,
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.860]   so it was like-- - The older team?
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.180]   - Yeah, it was more of an older team,
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.260]   the team that the year before didn't do well,
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.700]   they didn't make the tournament.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.940]   And then this team was supposed to be here,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.340]   and, like, you got an All-American coming in,
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.620]   and it's like, and he's getting all the national attention,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.820]   and they're just right there,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.660]   so, you know what I'm saying?
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.900]   They saw a team, and it's like,
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.820]   the only person I really had that was really close to me
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.460]   on the team was a couple of guys that were freshmen,
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.100]   and then my roommate, Cam Augusti.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.020]   And then, besides that, it was all older guys,
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.100]   and they kind of stuck together,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.140]   and it was like, it was hard, it was hard.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.300]   For me, it was just, it was a learning thing,
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.980]   a learning thing for me, just having to talk to guys,
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.820]   and just make sure I keep it team.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.580]   - Try not to step on toes, but still, at the same time,
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.820]   let them know, like, nah, you're the man.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.660]   - Yeah.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.420]   - Like, this is my joint, but y'all, like,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.540]   I feel like that'd be so hard.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.460]   That's why I asked the question,
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.140]   'cause, like, I feel like, especially in college,
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.620]   you get them older dudes, and the freshmen coming in,
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.220]   and he by far the best player.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.180]   Like, how do you keep that case?
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.860]   - Yeah, you just kinda just gotta, like, talk,
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.220]   you just gotta just be, you just kinda just gotta
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.140]   be yourself, like, don't ever let the,
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.780]   don't ever let the national media and,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.620]   - Yeah.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.740]   - You know what I'm saying, all that get to your head,
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.980]   and just make you change, 'cause, like,
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.940]   if you come in one way, and then all this stuff
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.220]   comes at you, and you're a different person,
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.500]   then they see that, you know what I'm saying?
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.580]   But if you're the same person from beginning to end,
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.100]   they see that, too, and I think that's something that,
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.100]   I mean, I didn't struggle with, but it was just,
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.140]   as far as changing myself, but it was just, like,
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.900]   a situation where, I mean, I think it was good,
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.260]   and I just had to learn, and learn that on my own.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.060]   - Right, 'cause lookin' in, like, y'all,
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.260]   like, y'all, look from the outside, y'all was good,
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.900]   but y'all, like, I just wondered that,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.580]   like, y'all were really good, but I didn't know
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.900]   if y'all could be better, if the chemistry was better,
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.820]   'cause y'all were, like, what, like,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.780]   top five for a second, then y'all start losin'.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.940]   - Yeah, we got all the way up to number,
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.860]   number three in the country.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.380]   - Then why y'all start losin'?
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.940]   - We started seein' teams twice in the Big 12.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.780]   - Oh, for real?
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.620]   - So the second time, teams,
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.460]   - They figured y'all out?
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.220]   - Yeah, they weren't, they were teamin' me,
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.020]   and, you know, I just, I just, I just, I don't know.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.020]   - But let's talk to the league then, bro.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.940]   So you, so, so you in the league now,
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.900]   your first year you did really, really good,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.940]   your second year you're an all-star,
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.740]   and then, so, like, now, from now on,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.620]   people kinda view you as, like,
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.820]   oh, he's supposed to be an all-star from here on out,
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.980]   like, and, and that was your second year in the NBA,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.860]   and people expect you to play at this all-star level,
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.220]   which, I feel like you should've been
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.860]   an all-star this year, like, like, no question.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.700]   But how do you, my question for you is,
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.060]   how do you deal with, like, the expectations now,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.540]   going forward, and just not putting that pressure
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.020]   on yourself, but at the same time, like,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:14.860]   you know what I'm sayin'?
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.140]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, for me it's,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.100]   I, like, you just can't worry about it.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.420]   Like, you just, for me, like, I've gotten to the point now
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.780]   where, like, I don't, I don't care about
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.420]   other people's expectations on me.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.500]   Like, my expectations of myself are higher
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.020]   than anybody else's could be.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.220]   So it's like, I mean, nothing they say is,
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.820]   is gonna make me feel some type of way
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.660]   when anybody else puts on me.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.140]   Like, I'm, I know what I, what I want,
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.980]   and you know what I'm sayin'?
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.820]   Like, I know--
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.260]   - And it's higher than any, what anybody else
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.100]   could expect from you, anyways.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.740]   - Yeah, yeah, and so that's, that's, that's how I'm just,
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.740]   that's how I go about it, that's how I think.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.420]   - Yeah, I feel like, like, a lot of young players,
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.180]   especially, but I know, like, me and you used to,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.180]   me and you used to struggle with this, too,
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.620]   'cause we'd look up our name on Twitter,
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.860]   see people talking about, like, as young players,
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.740]   you tend to want to, like, you play a lot of times
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.820]   for the approval of other people,
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.940]   like, you want them to talk good about you,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.300]   you want people to, you know,
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.220]   approve of how you're playing, whatever,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.300]   and then, like, if you're not meeting that,
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.620]   it can really, like, weigh on you.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.100]   But then, as you get older, and you get to the NBA,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.580]   you see there's so many games,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.220]   there's so many highs and lows,
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.100]   then you kinda learn, like, okay,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.340]   I'm not playing for the fans,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.260]   I'm not playing for, for the approval of other people,
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.540]   I'm just playing 'cause I love the game,
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.860]   and because, like, I wanna be the best I can be.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.780]   And then that kinda lets you play free.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.740]   And I know you, like, you be playing so free out there,
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.860]   so I know you kinda have a mindset of, like,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.620]   you're not worried about what other people are saying.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.260]   - Yeah, yeah, but it took me a while to get to this point.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.100]   Like, and I think it's tough,
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.260]   'cause our generation is, like,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.900]   is the first generation that's really going through this,
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.060]   'cause, like, the older people, like, I mean--
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.180]   - They ain't have no social media.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.420]   - They ain't have no social media.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.380]   This is new to them, like, they're, like,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.860]   like, a lot of the older guys in the league,
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.740]   like, they're, they didn't have to go from college,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.540]   and you're on your Twitter all the, like, in high school,
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.740]   and, like, we've been doing this since high school.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.100]   Like, and so, like, to be able to do that
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.260]   through high school and college,
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.940]   and then know when you get to the NBA
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.860]   that all that doesn't matter,
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.420]   and, like, all that looking for approval, like you said,
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.940]   like, that stuff doesn't matter.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.500]   Like, it's hard to, like, shut that off.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.580]   But once you, if you understand that as an early,
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.340]   like, at an early age,
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.580]   I think that can help you, I mean, like you said,
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.460]   the better you're gonna be.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.980]   - Yeah, no facts.
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.340]   And I think, like, I be saying, like, humans in general,
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.780]   people view NBA players like we're not really human.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.860]   Like, we don't have emotions,
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.140]   we don't see certain stuff on social media.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.500]   And I be saying, like, no human is supposed to experience
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.860]   that much praise, and no human is supposed to experience
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.980]   that much, like, hate.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.060]   Like, if you have a good game or a bad game, you know?
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.540]   Like, the way that fans talk about you is just crazy.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.140]   And social media obviously plays, like,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.260]   the biggest part into it, 'cause they just,
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.900]   it's easy for them to just comment
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.340]   whatever they want on your picture.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.500]   But like, but like you said, like, no one,
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.180]   the generation before didn't have to deal with that.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.860]   We received so much, like, praise,
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.100]   which I feel like can be a bad thing,
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.860]   'cause it gets people's head too big,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.940]   and they start changing it,
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.980]   and they start playing for that praise.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.020]   But then also, like, the criticism that we be getting,
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.860]   like, if we don't meet people's expectations, it's crazy.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.700]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.500]   - No, no, that's, that's crazy, bro.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.340]   - No.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.380]   - It's wild, bro.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.380]   - I can go on there for days talking about, like.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.580]   - No, say something about it, then.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.540]   Like, how you be feeling, how you be feeling about that?
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.220]   - I mean, for me, like, I don't,
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.300]   like, I just, I don't talk about, I don't,
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.860]   for me, it took a while to really get away from,
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:51.180]   like, not caring about other people's approval.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.020]   Like, you know what I'm saying?
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   My, I don't know, like, I literally have a,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.900]   excuse my language, not give a fuck, like, motto.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.540]   Like, that's just, I just don't.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.820]   Like, I just, like, unless it's important to me,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.140]   like, if you can't help me, or, like,
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.940]   you're not benefiting, like, helping me,
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.300]   or my family, or whatever, like,
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.220]   it's, I don't care about your opinion.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.580]   - Yeah, like, yeah, who are you?
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.900]   All these people talking, stuff, like,
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.460]   you never even gonna meet 'em,
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.220]   and they don't even care about you, like,
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.060]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.420]   And that thing, I realized, like, bro,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.100]   you can be as good, you can be the best player in the NBA,
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.940]   and have everything, and then, like,
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.780]   if you have a bad game,
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.060]   they still gonna talk crazy about you.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.020]   - Yeah. - You know what I'm saying?
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.340]   So, if you feed into that, bro, like,
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.020]   your emotions are gonna be on such a rollercoaster,
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.340]   'cause you can never live up to what people want.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.500]   People want perfection, like, fans want perfection.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.580]   - And you've seen guys, you've seen guys in the league go,
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.260]   like, leave the league, 'cause they just,
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.900]   they're so mentally, like--
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.780]   - Yeah, they don't know how to deal with the pressure.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.220]   - The pressure is tough, and it's, like, some of you,
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.380]   it's a real thing, like, a real struggle people have.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.460]   - It's a real struggle, and I just,
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.900]   I think, like, what really makes, like,
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.060]   the best the best, the more I'm thinking about it,
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.740]   is not, like, how people handle, like, the praise,
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.740]   but it's almost, like, how people can bounce back
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.500]   from the bad games, or the criticism,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.260]   and they get right back on their, like, what they do.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.380]   Like, you know, we've been talking,
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.460]   we've both been talking to Brett, you know,
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.900]   our mental strength guy, help us out with that stuff.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.140]   But he was just telling me the other day, like,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.140]   Tiger Woods, like, he's won, like,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.340]   he's lost way more matches than he's won,
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.060]   but he's still considered the best ever.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.180]   And it's got me thinking, like,
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.300]   what really, like, separates the greatest
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.460]   is really how they handle, like, losses.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.300]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.140]   - Yeah.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.380]   - So I think, like, and for me, really,
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.860]   that's why I kind of get off social media,
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.740]   because, like, it's easier to stay locked in
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.940]   and not really care what people think
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.420]   when you're not getting all the comments,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.100]   and not getting all the whatever.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.500]   There's other reasons, too.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.700]   You know, the females.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.700]   - But that's a big reason, so.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.540]   - Yeah.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.220]   - Yeah, bro, like, I was gonna ask you, too.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.260]   So, especially this year, like, in general,
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.860]   like, from the outside looking in,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.020]   it's been a lot of talk about the way you draw fouls.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.180]   You know, Steve Nash said he wasn't playing basketball
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.500]   or whatever, but to me, it's like,
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.260]   you're utilizing the rules of the game.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.620]   You're doing what they're giving you.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.100]   And, like, in the past, when players have figured out
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.940]   the game and figured out how to, like,
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.820]   take advantage of it, then it can cause, like,
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.700]   people, them to change the rules or whatever,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.660]   but that's not the player's fault.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.660]   That's being smart and having a good IQ.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.020]   So what do you think about, like,
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.740]   people criticizing you, like, especially this year?
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.340]   - Yeah, I mean, for, especially with the foul drawing,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.980]   like, I'm just, it's kind of frustrating.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.860]   I mean, Steve brought up, like,
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.260]   how smart I am at drawing fouls.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.460]   Like, how good I am at drawing fouls.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.420]   Like, the media took the "that's not basketball"
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.500]   and just blew it up.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.140]   Like, I was kind of frustrated at first when I saw it,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.940]   but then I saw the whole quote and I saw what he said.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.780]   But, like, me drawing fouls, like, that's just--
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.740]   - That's smart.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.180]   - It's just smart.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.860]   - I don't see why people would get mad at you,
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.220]   and why they, I see why people might get mad at the rules.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.060]   Like, if you, like--
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.900]   - Don't blame me, like, blame the rules.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.180]   - That's just being smart, like, you just,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.620]   that's being smart, like, if you,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.060]   if they wanna change the rules, make it so, like,
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.980]   if you pump fake and then you jump into someone,
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.900]   that's not a foul, or it's an offensive foul,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.340]   but don't get mad at someone, like, utilizing the rules.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.980]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm just, that's the thing.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.540]   Like, I'm not doing anything that the rules
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.460]   aren't saying I can't do, you know what I'm saying?
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.300]   - Right, exactly.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.060]   - I'm just, like, if a dude,
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.180]   and the thing is, is, like, people already hate
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.900]   that a smaller guy like me is, is, like,
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.260]   doing what I'm doing, and so, like,
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.620]   they're gonna try to be physical,
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.780]   and try to be, like, the thing that,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.060]   I know what, like, the game plan against me is,
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.140]   be physical, be rough 'em up, like--
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.420]   - So you learn how to use--
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.460]   - So I'm just learning how to, when they go,
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.940]   okay, you wanna bump me, all right, let's just,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.880]   we go off the screen, I know you gonna bump me,
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.060]   so I'm just gonna stop and just let you keep running.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   - Right. - You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.460]   Like, there's little things that I just,
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.700]   I'm, like, especially when my starting stops,
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.380]   like, like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go off the screen,
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.460]   I'll go full speed, and the natural thing is,
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.860]   if I stop, your momentum is still going,
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.140]   like, you still--
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:20.980]   - You gonna hit your--
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:21.820]   - You gonna hit me regardless.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.740]   - That's gonna be a foul, and that's, that is a foul,
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.420]   but that's, that's smart.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.940]   - Yeah. - Now, that had me tripping,
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.180]   too, like, how people gonna get mad at you
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.940]   for, for being a smart player?
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.700]   - It's, it's, it is what it is nowadays.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.460]   That's what I'm talking about when it comes to social media,
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.660]   it's like, like, now, it's like, I don't, I don't like that.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.060]   Like, I don't care about that no more.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.900]   - You don't care about none of that.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.940]   - Like, I don't care about that no more.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.740]   Like, maybe back a couple years ago,
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.820]   like, when I'm in college, and rookie year,
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.340]   like, that stuff fazed me, but it don't anymore.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.220]   - So, criticism, like, you would say you don't care,
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.860]   or did, like, some people could use it to make 'em better,
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.340]   or some people use it, and then they fall,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.180]   and they don't know what to do with criticism.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.700]   Do you, you just don't care about it at all,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.860]   or do you feel like it make you better?
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.780]   - I, I think it's, I think you pick and choose.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.900]   I think you, you, you hear everything.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.740]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.900]   Like, I hear everything.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.740]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.780]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick and choose what I let,
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.100]   I mean, let inside, and let it affect me,
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.780]   and what I don't, you know what I'm saying, so.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.340]   - That's, I mean, bro, that's what separates you,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.340]   'cause I'm, like, a lot of players can't do that,
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.380]   especially with the attention, and, you know,
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.300]   the criticism, and, like, the love,
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.900]   and the hate that you receive.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.740]   Like, a lot of players can't do that.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.420]   How would you say the NBA is different
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.900]   on the court and off the court
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.660]   than, like, college or high school?
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.380]   - I mean.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.900]   - On the, we'll start with on the court.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.940]   Like, how, how is the game different?
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.580]   - On the court, I mean, it's just the spacing.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.420]   - Yeah. - Like, the spacing.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.780]   Like, I look at college games now, and, like.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.620]   - It's hard to watch.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.460]   - It's hard to watch it,
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.140]   just 'cause, like, the defensive three safeties,
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.620]   like, the fact that somebody can sit in the lane,
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.900]   and you can't, you can't drive, and all that stuff.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.260]   That's, it's hard to watch,
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.260]   and I think that's the most frustrating thing,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.540]   like, the college game, and the difference from that,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.380]   in the NBA, is the spacing, and the,
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.100]   the fact that everybody can hoop.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.100]   Like. - In the league?
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.940]   - Everybody, yeah. - Like, there's no
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.820]   weak link, but if you leave a player open,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.820]   he probably gonna make a shot,
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.380]   even if he's the 12th man on the bench.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.500]   - Yeah. - He's still called.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.700]   - Still good, so.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.980]   I think that's, that's the difference,
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.220]   and then off the court, it's like,
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.820]   I don't know, it's like,
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.420]   you don't have to worry about anything.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.780]   - You got the bread, you got the money,
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.140]   you can do what you want.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.660]   - Yeah, it's more about treating this like it's,
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.540]   basically, you get the option of treating basketball
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.340]   how you want it, you know what I'm saying?
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.980]   It's like, you have everything,
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.540]   so you, you have this time after basketball,
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.940]   like, you get to pick, you wanna--
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.780]   - You get to pick what, yeah,
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.820]   you get to pick what you wanna do.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.420]   - You wanna, you wanna, how, how good do you wanna be?
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.380]   - You wanna lock in, and, and use your money,
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.460]   like, to buy a chef, to help your body, whatever,
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.980]   and you wanna use your money to fly five girls out
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.740]   to the crib, and, or go out, and, you know.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.580]   - Yeah, spending all the money on bottles and stuff,
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.940]   and do all that, or you can do,
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.940]   or you can spend that money on, like you said, a chef,
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.860]   like, like, so it's, it's, that's really the difference.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.220]   - It's like, the difference almost then is like,
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.620]   whatever you dreamed that you could do
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.780]   in high school or college, now you can actually do.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.620]   - Yeah.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.460]   - That's why a lot of people get the league,
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.460]   then they fall off, 'cause like,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.820]   they have the world in their, in their hands,
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.100]   and they don't stay locked, like, their whole goal,
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.460]   I think one of the biggest, like, differences
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.700]   between players that really, like, become really good,
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.940]   and players that just get to the league
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.260]   and kind of fizzle out, is like, what was your goal?
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.940]   Like, was your goal just to make the NBA,
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.820]   and then you just wanted to live the lifestyle?
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.300]   Or was your goal to be, like, one of the best players,
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.020]   and like, really, like, you really love basketball?
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.180]   - Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a difference of,
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.420]   of mindsets, whatever, of, of guys.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.780]   You can tell, like, guys, as you, as you start playing,
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   on what guys really focus on, too, you know.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.300]   - What do you think is the next step for you,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.780]   and your game, to become, like,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.220]   the player you ultimately could become?
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.860]   - Um, I think for me, I think for me,
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.260]   it's all just about winning, you know what I'm saying?
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.260]   Like, I mean, I'm always gonna be,
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.300]   I mean, I've, I've done, done a lot of things,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.820]   couple years already, but, I mean,
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.580]   all the individual stuff is gonna come, like,
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.820]   like, I think I'm always, one thing I've always took
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.180]   from Coach P is, win takes care of everything.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.500]   Like, if you win, everybody gonna eat.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.340]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.020]   So, like, winning, I know for me, like,
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.340]   all the individual stuff, like, all that,
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.700]   all that stuff's gonna come, like,
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.780]   it's, for me, like, to be looked at,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.220]   like, looked at different.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.140]   - As a winner.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.420]   - I wanna be looked at as a winner, so that's why.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.100]   - Like, CP3, like, now, at this point in his career,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.620]   everywhere he go, like, his, his reputation now
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.740]   is he's just a winner.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.580]   - Yeah.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.540]   - He can go to any, any organization.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.340]   - Just stick around the league for years doing that.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.020]   - Turn it around, yeah.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.140]   - So, I feel that.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.940]   What do you, so, so, how are you gonna spend
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.900]   your off-seasons, or what do you like to do
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.740]   outside of hoop?
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:11.100]   - I like being, I like being, like, with my close people,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.180]   friends, family, I mean, vacation, I mean, I play blackjacks.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.060]   - I feel that.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.620]   - We'll be in Vegas.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.820]   - We definitely gonna be in Vegas on the roulette, for sure.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.660]   - Oh, yeah, okay.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.940]   - Or, or, where did we go, Bahamas?
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.780]   - Yeah, Bahamas.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.860]   - We was on the roulette, losing crazy.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.620]   (both laughing)
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.180]   - We didn't even, we didn't even go to the beach for real,
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.500]   bro, we was in the casino the whole time.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.340]   - Yes, fam.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.700]   All right, this is my last question for you.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.140]   What would you say is your, what do you view
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.740]   as your purpose, like, what's your purpose?
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   - Oh, my purpose is, my purpose is just making sure,
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.380]   making sure my family is good, and then also inspiring
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:07.660]   the next generation, and making sure the game is better
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.820]   than it's left, I mean, for me, I get frustrated sometimes
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.820]   with the older players, not understanding that the game,
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.580]   it's okay if the game is better today, you know what I'm
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.740]   saying, like, it's because of y'all, like, the game,
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.500]   y'all made the game better, or whatever, and so now it's,
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.860]   LeBron came in from Jordan, then Steph came in,
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.060]   changed the game, like, the game gets better over time,
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.900]   so for me, I just wanna be one of those guys, hopefully,
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.100]   that makes the game a little bit better, and inspire others.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.380]   - Inspire others, that's dope, bro, well, I appreciate you
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.980]   coming on this joint, this is dope, man, my guy.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.380]   - What's the show called again?
