[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   I would really encourage people to make as many mistakes as possible.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.880]   When I'm really getting into learning a language and doing it intensively,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.240]   my goal is today I'm going to make 200 mistakes or more. That's my goal. And that gets you
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.840]   completely away from this academic mindset where every mistake brings you closer to a fail.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.480]   Every mistake is you communicating more. And like I said earlier, you suck a little less every day.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.960]   So that's my biggest takeaway other than speak from day one is I would encourage people to make
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.920]   mistakes. Embrace your inner Spanish Tarzan or whatever you imagine this caveman functionality
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.360]   of the language. Try to just use that. And that's how you push through those A levels
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.480]   to eventually then be communicating in the language. Embrace being a beginner. It's fine.
