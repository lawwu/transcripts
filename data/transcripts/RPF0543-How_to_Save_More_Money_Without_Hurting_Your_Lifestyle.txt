[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.720]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.760]   I am your fellow traveler down this road we call life, working diligently to enjoy my
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.640]   rich life today while also working on my plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.760]   And I'm very gratified that you are a big part of both of those things.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.640]   I find it very fulfilling and satisfying to belly up to my microphone and share with you
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.040]   some words that I trust will be helpful to you and will serve you.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   I find that very gratifying and it also helps me along my own path towards financial freedom
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.960]   by increasing my own personal revenue.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.480]   But today I want to talk about your revenue in an effort to work together with you to
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480]   increase it.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   Today we're going to talk about increasing income.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.240]   Over the last four years that I've been building Radical Personal Finance, I have structured
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.400]   everything on the show around what I call the framework for wealth.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.800]   That framework includes a total of 10 words and 5 points, or perhaps I should say 5 points
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   with a total of 10 words.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.520]   And this is the framework into which I organize every piece of financial advice that I give
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.280]   or that I hear.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.400]   And this is the framework onto which I hang every show that I do.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.520]   Before I record the show I always think through this framework.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.500]   This is original to me, although the concepts of course I'm sure are not perfectly original
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.560]   to me.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.520]   But these particular points have given me an organizing principle.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.100]   Let me give you a two minute introduction to the concept by way of reminder.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.180]   There are only three things that you can control that will determine the level of wealth, financial
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.640]   wealth that you build in your life.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   The first thing is to increase income.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.060]   All else equal, the higher your income, the wealthier you'll be.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.760]   The second thing is to decrease expenses.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.220]   All else being equal, the lower your expenses, the higher your wealth will be.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.160]   And the third thing is to invest wisely.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.920]   All else being equal, the better you are at investing, the wiser you become in allocating
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.400]   your capital, the higher the rate of return you earn from your investments, the wealthier
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.640]   you will be.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.120]   Those are the only three things that you can actually do that are practical.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.120]   You can increase your income, you can decrease your expenses, or you can invest wisely.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.620]   Three points, six words so far.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.740]   The final two layers are not ancillary, but they're not as direct.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.400]   Point number four is to avoid catastrophe.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.200]   This is where you consider a potential risk and how it will affect your life, and you
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.700]   put in place a plan to prepare for that.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.640]   This plan can be as simple as making sure that you have savings in case you lose your
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.900]   job.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.400]   That's a way of avoiding catastrophe.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.320]   You look at your income and you recognize, "If this income stream were to go away, I
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.760]   would have a problem."
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.320]   That's basic but essential, and that's part of avoiding catastrophe.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.540]   Avoiding catastrophe encompasses other aspects of thinking.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.880]   Perhaps it's putting in place an umbrella liability insurance policy to protect you
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.260]   against unspecified risks to your wealth.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.020]   Perhaps it's the practice of choosing creditor-protected investment accounts to accumulate wealth,
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.140]   such as a 401(k), because you don't know when you might be sued or go through bankruptcy
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.900]   and somebody have access to your wealth.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.500]   Perhaps it's buying a board of directors liability policy in case you're engaged in work as a
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.380]   board of director and you're found to be liability, and so you purchase liability policy to protect
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.380]   you from that.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.180]   It's as simple as building a food storage program to make sure that you always maintain
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.340]   one year worth of stored food for your family, so that if something happened and the truck
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.780]   stopped going to the grocery store quite so regularly, you wouldn't run out of food.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.900]   You'd be able to feed your children.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   There are many layers to avoiding catastrophe.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.540]   This week I was advising a consulting client on the importance of segregating and siloing
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.340]   various communications methodologies.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.340]   If you have a business, you should never mix your business and your personal cell phone.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.420]   For example, I have a friend of mine who unfortunately, through business practices that if you or
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.140]   I were to judge, might seem a little bit questionable but would not feel illegal.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.820]   Unfortunately, the FBI marched into his place of business and scooped up a cell phone.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.300]   Guess how many pages of documents were submitted to the court?
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:08.060]   3.3 million pages of documents were submitted to the court, the source of which is primarily
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.860]   cell phone and computer records.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.700]   Now I want to ask you a question.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:21.820]   How big of a risk would it be to your wealth if all of a sudden 3.3 million pages of your
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.140]   life were in the hands of somebody who was looking to put you into prison?
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.340]   That'd be a pretty significant problem, wouldn't you think?
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.220]   Now wouldn't it be better if the only cell phone that was available for the FBI's warrant
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.020]   was your business cell phone that only had your business records on it?
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.900]   Wouldn't it be better if that cell phone were encrypted and not some stupid fingerprint
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.300]   passcode that can be easily bypassed?
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.940]   Wouldn't it be better if you had thought in advance about your data security?
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.700]   We'll leave that show for another day, but it was a rather eye-opening experience for
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.180]   me to watch my friend, who is I would say a good guy, this particular business practice
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.340]   that he is charged with.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.280]   If the charges are true, it's not the kind of thing that you would say is really that
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   big of a deal.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.220]   It's the kind of thing that on a technicality in the law though is costing a huge amount
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.960]   of money and very possibly could result in prison time.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.060]   So avoiding catastrophe has many different expressions, from the thing that we're most
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.900]   accustomed to, asset allocation, to the thing that we very rarely talk about.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.320]   When I've done shows on why you should arrest proof yourself and your children, never talk
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.180]   to the police, things like that, that's all part of avoiding catastrophe.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.000]   And number five, of course, is optimize everything.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.820]   Optimization is where you sit down and say, "Can I get more value for the same money?"
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.780]   I currently drive this car and I like it, but can I drive a car that I enjoy more for
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.460]   the same value?
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.180]   Perhaps I can trade in this mundane, boring Econobox for a vehicle that I enjoy pulling
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.320]   through the gears with.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.460]   Or perhaps I can move from this side of town to the other side of town and the finances
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.460]   will be the same, but I'll have a shorter commute.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.780]   Or perhaps I can adjust my income stream and I may make $80,000 a year from this old job
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.900]   but maybe I'll switch over to this new job where I make $80,000 a year but I actually
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.940]   enjoy going to work or I like the people that I work with.
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:36.220]   Or my favorite saying, "I'm going to be working where I'm celebrated and not merely tolerated."
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.120]   That's optimization.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.620]   Now those five things, 10 words total, increase income, decrease expenses, invest wisely,
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.380]   avoid catastrophe in five, optimize everything.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:53.260]   Those 10 words encapsulate an organizing framework that you can put into place and this is the
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.660]   structure that I use for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.180]   But today I want to talk about increasing income.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.940]   I'm not certain that income is the best place for each person to start.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.500]   And if you are already in the top 5% of income earners, if your income is in the top 5% of
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.340]   income earners for your country of residence, the United States of America, that means that
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.100]   your income is about $225,000 per year or higher.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.300]   If you're already in that top 5% then there's a good chance that income is not the most
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.580]   important area of optimization for you to focus on.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:41.460]   For many people, expenses and decreasing expenses is the easiest area to focus on.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.980]   But the problem with decreasing expenses is there's ultimately a limit as to how low you
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.540]   can go.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.600]   You can cut your expenses today probably by 10%.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.140]   You may be able to cut your expenses today by 20%.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:08.380]   If you have a large enough motivation, you may be able to cut your expenses by 50%.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.900]   If you have a huge motivation and you've developed incredible skill with spending money, you
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.540]   may be able to cut your expenses by 75%.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:26.780]   But you can't cut your expenses by 100%.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.840]   Decreasing expenses gives us big wins.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   It's valuable.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.620]   I talk a lot about it.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.220]   I've developed a whole philosophy around decreasing expenses.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.580]   In the future I hope to sell you a course on that philosophy that you can put into place
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.540]   on decreasing expenses.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.060]   But not today.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:57.300]   Because while expenses can be cut until you arrive at a limit, increasing income does
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.880]   not have a limit.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:06.140]   There is no limit on how much money you can earn.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:14.360]   If you bristle at that statement, I challenge you, take your occupation, take your job,
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.580]   take your career, and go and research it to find somebody else who's involved in it who's
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.660]   earning 10 times as much as you are.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:33.500]   I guarantee you there's somebody in your career who's earning 10 times as much as you are.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.820]   If you were to ask that person, "Is there a limit to how much we can earn in this career?"
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:45.180]   I would bet you the answer would be no.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.820]   There's no limit on how much income you can earn.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.820]   What about investing?
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:54.380]   Is there a limit as to how much of a return you can earn on your investments?
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:01.180]   Well, sort of and sort of not.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:10.940]   Investing is the hardest nut to crack because in theory there really is almost no limit.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:19.020]   There are investments that return massive multiples of the original value, so it can
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.020]   feel like there's no limit.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:29.580]   But if you were to judge the feasibility of finding one of those investment opportunities,
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:38.420]   qualifying it, timing it correctly, and sinking enough capital into it at the right time,
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.580]   if you were to compare the feasibility of that entire process to the feasibility of
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:49.300]   increasing your income by 10x in the next 10 years, the feasibility of the investment
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.580]   process is very small.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.260]   The feasibility of increasing your income is very high.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.540]   And if you were choosing between those and you didn't have income or you didn't have
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:06.380]   assets, you would be well served to first focus on income because without investment
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.380]   capital you can't invest.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.540]   So the capital comes from your work.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:20.500]   Now catastrophe and optimization are things that are done all along the way, scalably.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.380]   You can avoid catastrophe on the small things, but if you're earning a minimum wage income
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.140]   there's no reason for you to be shopping and studying the market for board of director
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.780]   liability insurance policies.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.220]   On the flip side, if you earn a million bucks a year because you sit on 10 different boards,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:43.100]   you better know the market for board of directors liabilities policies and make sure that you
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:49.660]   have fully insured yourself and you probably need to worry a little bit less about your
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.540]   six month emergency fund at that stage of life.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.460]   So first, income is one of the most important areas to focus on.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.420]   It's possible for you to live a great lifestyle and also build wealth.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.780]   Many people feel like they have to give up one or the other.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.140]   They feel like, "Oh, if I want to save more money and build more wealth, financial wealth,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.260]   then I have to decrease my expenses."
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.900]   This is why so many people bristle at the idea of creating a budget or of following
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.560]   a budget or of cutting their expenses because they view it as a form of punishment.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.300]   They view it as a negative thing.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:37.180]   Well, my experience is most people who save more money don't view it as a punishment.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.880]   They view it as a positive thing.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.860]   They would rather have the freedom of being rich versus the misery and bondage of being
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.340]   poor.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.380]   And that's why they cut their expenses in order to save money.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.340]   But many feel like they have to do one or the other.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.300]   But you actually don't.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.900]   You can do both if you increase your income.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.260]   Let's use this example.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:12.820]   Assume for a moment that your household income is $100,000 per year.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.860]   Because you are a prudent person, you always work to spend half of your income and save
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.860]   half of your income.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:27.500]   So your baseline level is to spend $50,000 per year and to save $50,000 per year.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.460]   Now this plan of approach is good.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.140]   You have enough money to spend and enough money to save.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.140]   And if you continue this practice for a couple decades, you'll be financially independent
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.660]   and able to stop working if you don't want to.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.020]   But let's assume that you want to increase your spending.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.060]   Perhaps there are some things that you'd really like to do, you'd really like to have.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.960]   And you decide that you want to spend $75,000 this year instead of $50,000 per year.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.340]   And you think about it, you judge it, you research it, and you say, "No, I really value
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.100]   this additional $25,000 of savings."
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:12.500]   Well the necessary component for you to achieve that level of spending is to decrease your
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.820]   savings.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.940]   So if your income stays the same but you want to spend $75,000 this year, you'll have to
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.940]   decrease your savings to $25,000.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.140]   And your wealth plan will suffer.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:30.240]   Because an increase to spending will result in a decrease of saving.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.560]   On the other hand, let's assume that you've decided, "I want to save more aggressively."
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.600]   Well if your income stays the same but you want to save $75,000 this year, you're going
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.640]   to necessarily have to decrease your spending to $25,000.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   Because an increase to savings results in a decrease of spending.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.120]   That may be challenging.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   Because when you cut your spending from $50,000 to $25,000, you may find yourself in a situation
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.560]   where your lifestyle suffers.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:14.280]   And because we want to live a rich life now, while also working towards financial freedom,
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:20.600]   you might find that there's a tension between these two.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.000]   So what's the solution?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.440]   In an algebraic equation, if income is on the left side of the equal sign and expenses
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:42.880]   and savings are on the right side, if we want both expenses and savings to go up, we increase
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.920]   income.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:57.720]   If you increase your income to $150,000 per year, you can spend $75,000, which was one
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.940]   of your goals.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.520]   You wanted to increase your expenses from $50,000 to $75,000.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.060]   So you can spend $75,000 and live a richer life now.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:15.000]   And you can also save $75,000, which means you'll get richer faster now too.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.600]   Higher income allows you to increase your spending and to increase your savings.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.640]   It allows you to have both.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:36.560]   This is why it should always be a priority for you to raise your income.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.680]   Because the higher your income, the higher your lifestyle now and the higher your wealth
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.240]   in the future.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:51.520]   Perhaps this seems obvious to you, but from my experience working with flesh and blood
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.660]   clients, it's not obvious to most people.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:02.860]   Most people spend more time thinking about their annual vacation than they do about how
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.420]   to increase their income.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.880]   Most people spend more time griping and moaning about what's on their social media feed than
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.980]   they do preparing themselves to be worth more money in their workplace.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.900]   Most people spend more time thinking about how they can get out of work than they do
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:30.300]   thinking about how they can put more into work.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:42.140]   But work is the magic key to a high lifestyle and high wealth.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:50.860]   Don't miss the importance of this point because you're blinded by the simplicity of it.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:58.420]   I ask you today, what are you doing today that will result in your income increasing
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.540]   tomorrow?
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:10.380]   What's on your calendar this week that will result in your income increasing next year?
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:16.700]   What kind of planning have you been doing this year for your income to be higher a decade
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.720]   from now?
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.860]   If you just bump along randomly, your income will bump along randomly, sometimes up and
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.860]   down.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.100]   Sometimes you'll get a cost of living raise, sometimes you won't.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.220]   And you'll always be stuck in a world of scarcity.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:48.000]   But if you'll focus in and be intentional about building your income, you can live in
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.620]   a world of abundance and an ever increasing abundance.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:20:03.860]   The magic key to living a rich life now while also becoming wealthier is to make sure that
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.260]   your income is always going up.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:15.460]   You want to get a little bit richer each and every day and you fund that with income.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.940]   What can you do?
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:23.380]   Well, you can put in place a plan to increase your income.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.100]   That's what I'm here to help you with, but even if you don't want to work with me on
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:33.700]   my plan or on developing your own plan with my input, here's one very simple action step
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.900]   that you can make.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:42.060]   From now on, whenever your income increases from where it is, devote yourself to this
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.520]   simple practice.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.980]   Save half, spend half.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.100]   Save half, spend half.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:00.180]   If you want something else that you don't have, figure out how to earn more money and
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.500]   save half, spend half.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.060]   This is what I teach to my children.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:12.700]   My oldest child has three bags of money.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:23.460]   One bag is a spending bag, one bag is a giving bag, and one bag is an investing bag.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.380]   His financial plan is very simple at this stage.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.740]   One third of every dollar that comes into his life goes into giving.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.740]   One third of every dollar that comes into his life is spending.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.900]   One third of every dollar that goes into his life is investing.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.940]   Now at the moment, those dollars come from me, but we're working diligently with him
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.900]   to help him transform that investment bag into more money.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.060]   Recently he had a toy truck that he wanted to buy, and one of the benefits that I get
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:02.380]   out of giving my children a small steady allowance at this young phase is that I can automatically
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.100]   always say when he wants something, instead of having to decide yes or no, I just say,
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.180]   "Well, do you have enough money for it?"
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.220]   It's very helpful as a parenting tool.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.460]   The answer is no, he didn't have enough money.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.060]   So the question was, "Well, what can you do?
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.500]   How can you earn more money?"
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.700]   Well, the particular plan, we've worked on a number of different plans, but the plan
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:28.140]   for this last week was you could bake some bread and sell it.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.980]   We had found a bread maker on the side of the road that my wife trash picked, and we
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.340]   brought it home, plugged it in, worked great.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.620]   So he's not quite capable of kneading a loaf of bread, but he's at the stage where he can
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.580]   measure out ingredients.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.340]   So we found a bread recipe.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.620]   He measured out ingredients and pressed start, took the bread and sold it to a family friend
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.380]   for $2.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.060]   We charged him 50 cents for the ingredient cost, which left him with $1.50 of profit.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:03.100]   Well, his 50 cents for ingredient cost came out of his investment bag, and then the $1.50
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.980]   of profit was split up three ways.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.940]   So he had another 50 cents towards the purchase of his toy truck.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:16.180]   He had another 50 cents towards giving funds to give to people who are in need, and he
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.180]   had another 50 cents of investment money.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:29.860]   By earning more money and allocating the growth to those categories, he is richer now in both
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:38.820]   money and life because he has money to give to others and he has more money to spend for
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:47.580]   himself, and he'll be richer in the future because his investment funds are growing.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.900]   My hope for him, come back in 20 years or 30 years and let's see how it works, but my
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:24:04.220]   hope for him is every single day for the rest of his life, he will always, always grow wealthier.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.900]   Why?
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.840]   Because that investment capital is never to be spent.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.400]   It is only to be invested.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.820]   It's only there to provide capital to buy ingredients to bake bread.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.900]   It's only there to buy capital to buy things to sell at a higher price.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.380]   It's only there to invest.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:29.540]   Now that's for my four-year-old.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.740]   What's your plan?
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:43.220]   I commend this simple plan to you.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:52.940]   From now forward, put in place a plan to grow your income and for the rest of your life,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:01.660]   make sure that as your income grows, you always save half and spend half.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.340]   Save half and spend half.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.020]   Don't let your spending cost your savings.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.620]   Think back to our algebraic equation.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:19.260]   If I equals S plus S, let me come up with another letter here.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:25.620]   I on the left-hand side of the equation, I as income equals expenses.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:26.700]   We'll go with expenses for spending.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.700]   E plus S, so expenses plus savings.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:42.980]   If you want expenses to go up, don't rob from S. Rather, build a higher I. I, income,
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.700]   equals expenses plus savings.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.620]   Make sure by focusing on the I, the income on the left side of the equal sign, make sure
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:57.220]   that your E and S both go up.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:04.500]   Help keep the I constant and rob from savings to have higher expenses or to rob from expenses
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.380]   to have a higher savings.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.980]   Increase your I and you can live a richer life now and get richer for the rest of your
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.860]   life.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:24.300]   I'm very excited to you to announce that I am opening registration today for my guide,
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:30.140]   my course, to help you with this process of increasing income.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:37.180]   My intent with Radical Personal Finance is over time to build a virtual university of
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.180]   sorts.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:46.100]   I often imagine myself with my children at perhaps the age of 15 or 20 years old.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.820]   So I think of my son and my daughter at 15 or 20 years old and I pretend that I'm dead
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.820]   at 15 or 20.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.820]   I had a big car accident.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.180]   I'm dead and I'm gone.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:02.940]   And I think, "How can I put together a curriculum, an educational program, a university of sorts
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.500]   that will teach them what to do about money?"
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.140]   That's my personal motivation.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:14.340]   That's my personal driving factor and that's what I'm endeavoring to build for you.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.340]   I found this process to be about 10 times harder than I thought it was going to be.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.740]   I thought it was going to be easy and fast.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.820]   Well, it's not been easy nor fast.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.700]   Perhaps that was my own naivete showing through.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700]   But I'm getting better.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.700]   A year ago, I launched the beta course of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:39.420]   And in that beta course, I accepted 100 students to help me go through the first process of
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.420]   this.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.500]   And I promised that to those particular students who joined me at that time, I promised that
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.700]   I would keep working on it and I would make it the very best that I could for them.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:54.740]   That I would try to give everything that they need to do to know how to increase their income.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.180]   I think the beta version was okay.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.780]   I had a lot of good feedback from students.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.820]   I had some negative feedback.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.740]   I had a lot of things in my own, like it was a lot harder to do than I thought.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.980]   So the feedback I got, I think I would judge it as okay.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.820]   But we finished through version one and then I worked through and I've created now version
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:21.100]   two, which I am opening to you for registration for the next four weeks.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.580]   The next four weeks only.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.780]   For this particular course, at some point in time, it might be a standalone thing that
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.660]   people can join at any point in time.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.060]   That'll be the plan for some variations of products in the future.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.340]   But for this course, I want it to go through with a particular time that it is open.
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.700]   My hope is that all the students will be able to go through over the course of 12 weeks.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.740]   But for the next four weeks, registration is going to be open.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.020]   Today is May 9, 2018.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.900]   Registration will close on June 6, 2018.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.940]   So for the next four weeks, this particular course will be open.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:07.060]   There are a total of currently 104 modules in the course.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.700]   It is loosely organized, I mean, rephrase that, it's tightly organized around the things
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.620]   that I think are the most helpful.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.900]   I have a module in there called Income Strategies for Desperate Situations.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.820]   In that particular module, I seek to help somebody who's out of cash, broke, out of
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.820]   work, etc.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.900]   I hope that none of my students need that, but it's there so that they can help other
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.180]   people.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.140]   We have a module called Daily Actions for You to Take to 10X Your Income in the Next
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.060]   10 Years, which is extensive and it's all about how do you take the opportunity you're
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.900]   in right now and develop that.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.380]   I have an extensive philosophical module called Why Your Income Matters, more than just about
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.580]   anything else in your financial plan.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.100]   What you've just heard on today's show was one tiny little section from that about how
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.380]   if you increase your income, you can build more lifestyle and become wealthier.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.180]   But there is a lot of content there because if your motivation is high enough, you'll
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.100]   figure out what to do.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.060]   And so there's an extensive amount there.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.100]   I have information on transition plans, on how to transition jobs, careers, etc., both
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.940]   practical and philosophical.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:16.500]   How to choose work that's right for you, lots of philosophical and practical tools there.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.380]   And then how to earn a high and always increasing income, lots and lots of practical structural
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.380]   things.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:32.740]   My ambition, my ambition with the content that I create is to focus in on timeless principles.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:39.540]   I'm not a big fan of the short-term tactics, partly because, well, my mind just doesn't
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.780]   work in that way.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.380]   I see plans in any context and their tactics will change depending on where you are.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.300]   I'm interested in principles that will stand the test of time.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.020]   My hope is whenever I finish up this financial planning career, I don't know how long I'll
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:00.220]   do it, but whenever I close this down and move on to another phase of my own personal
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.060]   work, my hope is that I'll be able to make an impact with principles, things that will
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:09.180]   stand, not just a few hot stock tips that'll work for today, but rather here are some principles
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.420]   that will stand the test of time.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.620]   That's my personal ambition.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:17.900]   So 90 to 95% of the content in the course is timeless.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:24.380]   It's intended to be applicable at any time and it's intended to be applicable in any
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.380]   context.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:31.820]   I have to modify that slightly to say any capitalist market-driven context.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:38.820]   I say very clearly in the course, I can't help you if you work in a system of bureaucracy.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.740]   If you're a government bureaucrat where you get paid more for simply staying there for
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:49.140]   longer, there's not a lot you can do except stay for longer or leave, or if you are in
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:55.980]   a closed economy, if you live in a communist system where I can help you when you're working
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:01.660]   in the free market, aka the black market, but I can't help you in the official system.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   Those systems are broken.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.940]   They'll eventually fall apart.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.800]   But I can help you if you live in an open free market economy.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.900]   So if you have any interest in increasing your income, I would invite you to come by
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.900]   and check it out.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:17.980]   The website for you to go to is RadicalPersonalFinance.com/IncreaseIncome.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.500]   Again that's RadicalPersonalFinance.com/IncreaseIncome.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.700]   Link also in the notes for today's show.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:33.300]   Here is my desire for you to, or here is my recommendation for you for how to join the
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.940]   course and what I intend to do.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.740]   The launch window, it'll be open for the next four weeks.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.420]   Today again is May 9.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.620]   Light registration will be open through Wednesday, June 6.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:50.100]   However, each week the price will increase by $100.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.660]   Currently the price for this course is $395.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.060]   That is the initial introductory price.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.180]   One week from today it'll go up to $495.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.780]   One week after it'll go up to $595 and it will close out this particular launch cycle
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:10.940]   at $695.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:16.540]   So my desire is to incentivize you to purchase now very quickly.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:22.140]   In the next week until Wednesday, May 16, the price is the lowest that it'll ever be.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.740]   I'll never sell it for less than this in the future and that price is $395.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:32.060]   If you are a patron, log into the Patreon site and there is a discount there for you
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.260]   as a patron.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.420]   So log in there before signing up for the course.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.660]   But if you have any interest in working through this course with me, there are again about
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.340]   104 lessons currently there in the course.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.820]   Also I have weekly and bi-weekly conference calls scheduled over the next 12 weeks.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.500]   So those calls will be extensive.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.460]   You'll have extensive time to interact with me and other students.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.940]   I will be very, very busy there in the comments answering all of your personal questions,
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:03.360]   seeking to help you to take the information from the public pre-recorded lessons and make
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.100]   it personal to you.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.420]   I'll also be taking your feedback along the way as I tell the students in the actual course.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.660]   I'll be taking your feedback and if something is unclear, I'll rework it.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.820]   If you feel like there's something that's a little bit light and you'd like more information,
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.460]   I'll add additional components and modules to the course as time goes on based upon the
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.940]   audience feedback.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:29.140]   So come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome if you have any interest in this.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:33.260]   Oh, also, unconditional 30-day money back guarantee.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.740]   So if you would just like to try it, check it out, come on by and purchase the course.

[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.420]   You don't have to wait on anything from me except those conference calls.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:55.180]   But the first conference call is already scheduled for this coming Tuesday, May 14.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.840]   So it'll be ready to go for you on Tuesday, May 14 for the first conference call.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.240]   So you can buy today and you can be involved in the course for the next 30 days and with
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.100]   no questions asked, no reason, if you feel like for any reason you want your money back,
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.100]   you just send me an email.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.100]   I won't ask a question.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:17.700]   I will just simply make a refund your money within 30 days of the purchase price.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:25.860]   So for the next week from today, May 9 until the end of the day on May 15, the price of
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:33.580]   the course is $395 and it will go up to $495 on Wednesday, May 16.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.660]   Come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome and check out the course.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:43.820]   I would love to work with you and to serve you to develop a plan to increase your income.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:48.500]   As I close, my final pitch to you is this.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.780]   Consider your lifestyle.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.460]   Consider how much money you spend.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:36:00.180]   Consider how much money you save and ask yourself this.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:08.100]   If over the next three years I could increase my income by about 50%, what kind of difference
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:14.380]   would that make to my lifestyle and to my wealth plan?
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:20.740]   I guarantee you, you can put a plan in place to increase your income by 50% in the next
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.740]   three years.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:27.460]   You can go higher, but I want to be modest with my, when I say I guarantee, I want to
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.820]   be modest with the use of that term.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:39.300]   You can increase your income by 50% and along the way, you can also optimize your income.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.420]   So how would that affect your life?
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.380]   Have you ever known anybody else who's increased their income by 50% in the course of three
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.380]   years?
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.220]   I've known a lot of people.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.580]   What if you could double your income in the next five years?
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:01.160]   I'm very confident that you could double your income in the next five years.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:09.660]   What if you could quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, 10X your income in the
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.300]   next 10 years?
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.900]   How would that increase and affect your lifestyle and your income?
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.540]   I'm convinced you can.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.620]   I've done it.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:30.900]   I'm still too close to the beginning of my career to say that I have fully, I've done
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.900]   it sort of.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.940]   I'm almost there.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.540]   I'll be there soon.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.580]   I will have done it a few years from now and I've known a lot of other people who have
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.580]   done it.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.020]   So that's enough of my pitch for today.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:51.220]   If you want to get a great deal on a great course and you want to work with me to put
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:58.100]   in place a specific careful plan to help you increase your income dramatically while also
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:04.660]   simultaneously building your lifestyle, gaining more enjoyment and satisfaction from your
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:12.380]   work, come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome and buy today.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:15.820]   Time to text the group chat because Barbados is now closer than ever.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.660]   A beautiful island adventure awaits and getting here just got a little easier.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.420]   Warm up your winter and escape to our tropical paradise.
