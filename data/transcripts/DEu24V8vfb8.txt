[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   - When you think about entities that's out there,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.640]   something that even is recognizable to us as life?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.200]   Or would they be radically different?
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.480]   - Well, how did we become intelligent?
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.800]   Basically, three things made us intelligent.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.960]   One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.800]   We have the eyes of a hunter.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.880]   Stereo vision, so we lock in on targets.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.880]   And who is smarter, predator or prey?
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.200]   Predators are smarter than prey.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.860]   They have their eyes to the front of their face,
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.080]   like lions, tigers, while rabbits have eyes
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.440]   to the side of their face.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.480]   Why is that?
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.360]   Hunters have to zero in on the target.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.200]   They have to know how to ambush.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.640]   They have to know how to hide, camouflage,
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.800]   sneak up, stealth, deceit.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.600]   That takes a lot of intelligence.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.860]   Rabbits, all they have to do is run.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.440]   So that's the first criterion,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560]   stereo eyesight of some sort.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.440]   Second is the thumb.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.280]   The opposable thumb of some sort
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.760]   could be a claw or tentacle.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.320]   So hand-eye coordination.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.920]   Hand-eye coordination is the way
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.480]   we manipulate the environment.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.720]   And then three, language.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.880]   Because, you know, Mama Bear never tells Baby Bear
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.040]   to avoid the human hunter.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   Bears just learn by themselves.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.720]   They never hand out information
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.920]   from one generation to the next.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.880]   So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.640]   Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.300]   or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.740]   Now ask yourself a simple question.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.080]   How many animals have all three?
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.140]   - Just us.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.880]   - It's just us.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.680]   I mean, the primates, they have a language.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.400]   Yeah, they may get up to maybe 20 words,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.360]   but a baby learns a word a day,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.800]   several words a day a baby learns.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.480]   While the maximum number of words
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.280]   that you can teach a gorilla in any language,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.360]   including their own language, is about 20 or so.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.760]   And so we see the difference in intelligence.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.240]   So when we meet aliens from outer space,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.720]   chances are they will have been descended
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   from predators of some sort.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.120]   They'll have some way to manipulate the environment
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.660]   and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.680]   That's it, folks.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.840]   - So functionally, that would be similar.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.580]   We would be able to recognize them.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.840]   - Well, not necessarily,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.260]   because I think even with homo sapiens,
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.260]   we are eventually going to perhaps become part cybernetic
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.320]   and genetically enhanced.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.200]   Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.400]   Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.960]   but in the coming years,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.160]   our robots will be as smart as a mouse,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.520]   then maybe as smart as a rabbit.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.880]   If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   And by the end of this century, who knows for sure,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.360]   our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.640]   Now at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.400]   You see, monkeys are self-aware.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.960]   They know they are monkeys.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.840]   They may have a different agenda than us.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.220]   While dogs, dogs are confused.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.440]   You see, dogs think that we are a dog,
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.020]   that we're the top dog.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.160]   They're the underdog.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.320]   That's why they whimper and follow us
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.960]   and lick us all the time.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.600]   We're the top dog.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.100]   Monkeys have no illusion at all.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.920]   They know we are not monkeys.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.600]   And so I think that in the future,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   once our robots have murderous thoughts.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   But that's in a hundred years.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.180]   In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.280]   to remove that fail-safe chip in their brain
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.480]   and then watch out.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.520]   we should merge with them.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.420]   We should become part cybernetic.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.120]   So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
