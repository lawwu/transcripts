[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Christian friends, I have, I believe, three briefs.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:18.240]   The first is to be brief, and the second is to say something about Dr. Lloyd-Jones's
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.220]   work in connection with the London Theological Seminary, and the third is to say something
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.640]   about him as the preacher that he was.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.480]   Reference to that has already been made repeatedly.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.000]   In effect, the two briefs that I have to speak about the seminary and Dr. Lloyd-Jones as
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.940]   a preacher, they really knit together, they stand together, because the London Theological
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:06.020]   Seminary, which is only in its fourth year, is, in my mind at any rate, and I feel in
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.240]   the minds of my colleagues on the board and the faculty, the outcome of Dr. Lloyd-Jones
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:24.980]   as a preacher and as his hand of his preaching throughout the past fifty or more years.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.260]   And I believe that it should be possible, therefore, for me to knit these two things
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.940]   together quite simply and effectively, as the Lord helps us.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:45.220]   Dr. Lloyd-Jones was pre-eminently a preacher; I have to disagree with Dr. Davis in that
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.620]   he said that he thought of Dr. Lloyd-Jones as pre-eminently—didn't he actually use
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.820]   that word?—but by implication, a doctor.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.300]   I believe that he was a preacher.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.340]   It was his preaching that made him such a power in the Christian Medical Fellowship,
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.500]   and it was his preaching, as Dr. Wells acknowledged, that made him such an influence among students.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.600]   And it was his preaching that was responsible and is responsible, as we have already heard
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.300]   from Mr. Murray, for the literature, for the books that have now reached a million sales
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.700]   throughout the world, and I believe will go on to do their great work in days to come.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.840]   And the London Theological Seminary was, I believe, a result of his preaching.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.820]   It was because of what he was as a preacher and the way that he preached that we came
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.260]   together to establish this seminary in London.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.260]   The purpose of the seminary is to produce preachers.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:13.020]   It has no other function whatsoever, and its origin lies in what we saw and heard in Dr.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.460]   Lloyd-Jones over these many years.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.980]   We could see something of the decline of preaching in our land and the devaluing of it that was
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.540]   going on throughout the world, and we felt that it was time for us to come together and
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.140]   to do something in order to produce preachers once again for our churches and for the work
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.340]   of the gospel in Britain and elsewhere.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.620]   I well recall, and I am sure that my colleagues on the board will remember with me, the early
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.900]   board meetings we had.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.900]   We had no resources of any kind, no place, no money.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.820]   We had nothing, in fact, except this vision, this aim, this compulsion that we felt that
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.540]   a seminary had to be established.
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:18.620]   And we remember the doctor who was our first chairman lecturing us downstairs, in the room
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:28.020]   downstairs here, on the aims of such a seminary, if it should come into being, and on the methods
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:36.440]   that were to be employed in producing preachers in the years to come.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.980]   He was lecturing us so many times.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.660]   I remember him saying quite clearly and strongly in his own inimitable way that it was not
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.200]   to be a mere academy of learning.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.060]   It was not to be a place for mere intellectual cultivation, and it was not to be a place
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.700]   where the pursuit of degrees, university degrees, would be followed.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.900]   His position was, and we shared it with him, that the degrees provided by a secular institution
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.300]   did not of necessity qualify a man to preach the gospel.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.320]   And that is something that perhaps the people of God still need to come to terms with.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:39.220]   That is not to deride education or to devalue the significance of it in many realms, but
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.700]   it does not of necessity mean that because a man has some qualification or other provided
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.940]   by what is essentially a secular institution that he is able to preach the gospel as it
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.620]   is intended to be preached.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:04.180]   And this is why the London Theological Seminary came into being.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:13.260]   There were some things that the doctor laid down in those board meetings which had come
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:20.140]   together in order to try and bring the seminary into existence.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.700]   The first thing was that the students accepted to the seminary would have to provide us with
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:36.460]   a credible evidence of having been called of God to preach the gospel.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.740]   In other words, the seminary would not be concerned with turning out teachers, with
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.820]   turning out or providing religious education, but rather the only people to be accepted
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.500]   were those who could give us some credible evidence, confirmed by their churches, if
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.180]   at all possible, of having been called to preach the gospel.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.660]   We'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.340]   And the intention of the seminary would be to provide that essential framework of Bible
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:18.660]   knowledge and doctrine and church history and related subjects, principally so that
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:26.180]   the students in the seminary would be taught how to think for themselves.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:34.300]   I well recall the board meeting at which this was discussed, and the doctor telling us how
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:41.860]   he had met repeatedly with ministers in various parts of the country who, when they came to
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.820]   the end of the notes of the lectures that they received in college, they had to look
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.300]   for another call.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.620]   They could not think for themselves.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.940]   They could not handle the Word of God.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.980]   And for that reason, the doctor was concerned that the seminary, the methods employed to
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:10.980]   teach in the seminary, would be such that the students there would be encouraged, would
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:18.180]   be taught how to think for themselves, so that they could go on and on and on.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.540]   And that is what the purpose of the seminary really is.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:33.140]   I said already that all this was the outcome of Dr. Lloyd-Jones himself, the preacher,
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.560]   over and above everything else that he was.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.420]   He believed in the foolishness of preaching.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:47.780]   He believed that statement that we have in the first epistle of the Corinthians and the
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:54.140]   first chapter, that it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save them
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.020]   that believed.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:03.020]   And that needed to be emphasised, it needs to be emphasised in our day and time.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:09.380]   We are in days when there are evangelical people who seem to have forgotten that text
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.580]   and who seem to reject it out of hand.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:20.780]   It is now popular to believe that it is through the foolishness of music or of singing to
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:28.060]   save them that believed, or it is through the foolishness of drama or miming or dancing
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.940]   and goodness knows other things, to save them that believed.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:39.780]   But what the seminary stood for was what the doctor himself stood for, namely that it pleased
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:45.500]   God through the foolishness of preaching to save them that believed.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:54.620]   And that, I believe, was the result of the doctor himself and what we came to know of
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:00.380]   him and heard from him down through those long years.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.540]   Of course, the doctor was an exceptionally gifted man.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.040]   We have heard of some of that already.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.640]   And his abilities were quite staggering.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.340]   Some of us—I don't know whether our chairman is going to say something about it—some
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.900]   of us attending the minister's fraternal here were quite amazed again and again and
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:28.940]   again, a subject being raised and the doctor able to handle it exactly as if he had been
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.460]   studying it for the past month or so before coming to the meeting.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:39.260]   I was not present some time ago when somebody asked a question about acupuncture and he
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:49.020]   proceeded to give a lecture for an hour and twenty minutes on acupuncture.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:57.780]   We have to concede that he was a doctor after all.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.900]   But his vital qualifications were the qualifications of a preacher.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.580]   They were spiritual qualifications, and I want to note those briefly because I do not
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:18.220]   see how we can rightly give thanks to God for the doctor and for his ministry if we
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:26.060]   do not acknowledge and recognize those spiritual qualifications that he had.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.080]   They are quite simple, they are quite straightforward in a sense.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.420]   Some of them have already been mentioned, but they will bear repetition.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   The first thing is that he was called himself.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.060]   He was called of God.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:50.620]   He left the medical school to enter the pulpit as a result of a call from heaven.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:57.060]   That is the only explanation.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:08.740]   I am older than some of the speakers that – well, not the last one.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:18.460]   I am older than some of the speakers, and I remember the headlines of the newspapers
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:31.460]   in 1927 announcing that a man from Harley Street was coming down to a small little church
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:38.220]   in an industrialized community in Wales to take up the ministry of the gospel.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:44.140]   There were banner headlines across the front pages of the newspapers.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:52.420]   My parents were converted in the 1904 revival, so that they were concerned with these things,
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.620]   and I was a young boy.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:02.300]   And for the very first time, the church in Wales and the chapels in our village, they
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.500]   joined together.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.280]   This was before the days of ecumenism.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:13.420]   They joined together to invite this phenomenon to preach in our village.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:21.380]   They took the public hall, and I was preoccupied at that time with a game of football, and
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.660]   it was the oval ball.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.960]   And I didn't go to the meeting, but the playing field was beside the public hall,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:39.780]   and I can still see a young man walking with a local vicar from the afternoon meeting,
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.240]   walking up the road to have a cup of tea somewhere.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.180]   And that was my first glimpse of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:54.420]   Little did I know that at that time that he was going to exercise the greatest influence
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.620]   in my own life.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:05.180]   Incidentally, they never asked him back.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.940]   What was the explanation?
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.420]   The Lord took him.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.420]   That was the explanation.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:21.260]   He was invincibly called to what he described himself more than once, the greatest of all
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:30.620]   tasks, and that was to preach the glorious gospel of the blessed God to men and women.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:38.700]   The second thing I mention is this, his concern for people.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:45.660]   I know from what he told me personally that this was a very significant factor in that
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.140]   call itself.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:56.340]   He told me more than once that he was helping men and women with their physical diseases,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:04.740]   and yet it was staring him in his face that they had souls that were going to a lost eternity.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:11.500]   So that what ultimate benefit was there in healing their bodies and their souls going
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.820]   to hell?
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:23.740]   And that was one of the considerations that the Lord used to call him into the work of
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.740]   the gospel.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.100]   I cannot enlarge on that.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:35.060]   But even after he arrived in South Wales and was now preaching the gospel, he was still
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.140]   concerned about men and women with their physical ailments.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:47.380]   And indeed, from what he told me himself, his time in South Wales became so full, not
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.700]   only with the preaching in his own church and throughout the length and breadth of the
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:16:00.660]   country, but with local general practitioners sending people to him to be examined by him,
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:07.300]   cries for help from every quarter, until in the end, after eleven years, he told me himself
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.780]   he had to call a halt, otherwise he would be a broken man.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:19.380]   So that although his preeminent work was preaching the gospel and his concern for souls, he still
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:25.620]   had a true concern for men and women in their physical distresses.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:33.580]   And of course, as we heard from Mr. McElwright, he had a surgery in the chapel here for thirty
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:39.900]   years every Sunday night, half past nine, ten o'clock on a Sunday night, before he
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.900]   could begin his journey home.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:49.920]   And he also told me when he had finished here that it had been a great problem to him, having
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.060]   to deal with men and women in that way, preaching as he was and so on, how to tell Westminster
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:02.260]   Chapel, and I've been a member here since 1953, how to tell Westminster Chapel that
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.460]   he had to finish.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.820]   He just couldn't tell them.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.780]   And he said that on his way to hospital in the ambulance, the Lord told him, "It's
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.780]   finished."
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.900]   It was the Lord that intervened and helped him at that point.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:25.820]   The whole thing that I'm seeking to emphasize is this, his concern for people.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:34.260]   And finally, his view of the gospel, his view of the gospel.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.100]   His gospel involved the Holy Trinity.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:46.460]   I always noted the way that he referred to the Holy Trinity, the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.340]   inevitably, the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.900]   And again and again I heard him preaching here.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:02.060]   Sunday morning, Sunday evenings, Friday evenings, it was God's plan.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.220]   It was the work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.860]   It was the power and ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:17.300]   He had that high view of the gospel of Jesus Christ, akin to the apostle Paul of old, who
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:26.060]   thought of it as the power of God and to salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.420]   Whether he was preaching to saints on a Sunday morning, preaching to sinners on a Sunday
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:37.900]   night, expounding the epistle to the Romans on Friday evenings, wherever he began, sooner
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:45.940]   or later in his message, he would be emphasizing the glories of the gospel.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:52.580]   Sooner or later, I'm reminded of something I learned in theological college.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.260]   I learned a lot more after coming here than I did there.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.820]   But I remember something that I learned there.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.940]   A professor once telling us—I'm not quite sure that he understood what he was saying
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   himself.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:14.020]   I'm sorry if there is—Professor Collins is here.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:21.120]   I remember the professor saying, giving us some advice as students and saying something
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.340]   like this.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:30.500]   "Whenever you enter the pulpit," he said, "pitch your tent on Calvary's hill," he said,
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.980]   "within view of that cross."
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:41.820]   "Pitch your tent on Calvary's hill within view of the cross."
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.980]   Again and again I thought of that statement down through the years here in Westminster
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.220]   Chapel.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:53.500]   I sat up there always, and the doctor down here.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.540]   And wherever he began his message, whatever his theme was, before very long you knew that
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.900]   he had pitched his tent on Calvary's hill within full view of that blessed cross of
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.420]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.980]   His view of the gospel, I say, was a high view.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.580]   He had no hobby horses.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.060]   Important thing for you and me as preachers, my friends?
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.540]   No hobby horses.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:32.460]   He had no tangents, and he had no confusion in his ministry, no trappings, no pretensions,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.140]   no compromise.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:43.220]   His high view of the gospel, it superintended and controlled him at all times whenever he
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.220]   entered the pulpit.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.500]   I must finish.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:59.060]   A.W. Pink, in his preface to the book on Elijah, gives us a definition of a prophet, and this
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:05.780]   is what he says, "God's man for evil days."
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.820]   And that to me was Dr. Lloyd-Jones.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.740]   He was God's man for evil days.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:21.400]   When I came out into the ministry in 1946 in Wales, I don't know, but I somehow feel
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.900]   that you could have counted the out and out evangelical preachers of the gospel on two
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.740]   hands.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:36.340]   The situation in Wales today is vastly different, and it is vastly different in Britain too.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:43.620]   And I attribute it in the main under God to Dr. Lloyd-Jones, whose sermons turned back
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:51.220]   the tides of liberalism and ecumenism and the pseudo-evangelicalism.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.420]   He turned them back with his great preaching.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.780]   I went to a modernist college.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:04.380]   I was the only converted man on the premises, staff and students, but I happened to have
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:10.500]   a car even in war days, and I could go all over South Wales to hear him preaching.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.980]   And I remember his preaching even to this day.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.100]   Let me give you one or two of his texts.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:22.460]   They laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead, Jairus's daughter.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:28.340]   "This kind cometh not forth except by prayer and fasting."
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:35.460]   I remember his monumental sermon on Dagon and the Philistines, and that great sermon,
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:41.340]   "Thou fool, this night thy soul will be required of thee."
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.660]   I finish with this.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:55.560]   I drove the doctor to a certain place some years ago, and he had some time previously
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:03.660]   been invited to speak to the British Medical Association in its annual meeting in Cardiff.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:10.300]   They have as their custom to invite a prominent man to address them at a breakfast, and the
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   doctor was invited to address them in the Park Hotel in Cardiff.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.700]   And he told me that he had prepared a special lecture to bring to these eminent men, not
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.780]   only British, but from the whole wide world.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.620]   And as he was having his breakfast with them, sitting at the top table with these eminent
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:40.820]   men, he told me that he felt the Lord was telling him to forget his lecture and to preach
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.380]   to them.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:50.340]   And he got up and he preached to them, and his text was, "Thou fool, this night thy soul
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.000]   will be required of thee."
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.020]   I happened to know a doctor from Cardiff who was at that breakfast, and he told me subsequently
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:07.420]   that he saw those men sitting on either side of Dr. Lloyd-Jones with the tears streaming
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:16.180]   down their faces as they heard the gospel being powerfully and convincingly preached
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.740]   by the great preacher, our doctor.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:30.420]   My friends, it was said of John the Baptist, after he had gone, and the Lord Jesus arrived
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:37.540]   at the place where he had been ministering, John did no miracle, but all things that John
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:42.500]   said of this man was true.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.860]   We can say that of our beloved doctor.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.860]   Amen.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.860]   Amen.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.860]   Amen.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.860]   Amen.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:55.860]   Amen.
