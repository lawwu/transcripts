[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I am your host.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.400]   Today, I'm pleased to welcome back to the show, Stephen Harris.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.800]   Stephen, welcome to the show today.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   Hey, Josh.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200]   Great to be back.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.400]   Always a fun time.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.440]   I'm looking forward to this.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.240]   And if you're listening to this, buckle up, hang on, and get ready for a fun ride.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.240]   Absolutely.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   Today, we're going to be talking about commodities and the concept of investing in commodities,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.800]   saving money in commodities.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.800]   But we're going to do it in a little bit of a different way than many people are accustomed
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   to.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.680]   Steve, you're not known for holding back on your opinions, and so I think it's going to
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320]   be fun because I'm also not known for that.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.040]   We get along well in that regard.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.080]   And I think we're going to have an interesting conversation on the subject of commodities
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.160]   in a way that's not usually done.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.780]   And I want to lay about 60 seconds of groundwork by way of introduction, and then we'll discuss
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.040]   some of the specific details.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.960]   Many people think, especially when it comes to thinking about hard times, hard financial
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.000]   times, many people think about the value of owning some form of commodity.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.520]   But usually, that term is used to refer to precious metals, usually gold and silver coins,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.320]   something like that, although there are people who extend things beyond there.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   And there are great benefits in owning things like gold and silver coins.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.080]   But I like to think about the term a little bit more broadly.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   And this has been a common theme on Radical Personal Finance going all the way back to
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.600]   I mean probably within the first 50 episodes, the first 100 episodes, I talked about the
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.160]   old book by John—what's his name—The Alpha Strategy, John Pugsley called The Alpha Strategy,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.040]   where he was facing what he thought was going to be impending inflation back in the 1970s.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.900]   And he thought, "What can I do in order to prepare for inflation?"
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.080]   And the basic idea that he came to was, "Well, if I buy the things that I'll use in the future
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.880]   with current money, and then store those things and use them over time, then I'll have protected
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.720]   my money from the potential ravages of inflation."
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.800]   And that strategy is, in my opinion, one of the simplest strategies for people to incorporate
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.640]   to protect for inflation.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.760]   It's very hard to predict what's going to happen with a financial portfolio, an investment
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.100]   portfolio during a period of inflation.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.720]   There are different times where portfolios are affected differently.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.000]   But it's not difficult to predict what's going to happen with the value of a stockpile of
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.600]   toilet paper that I have in my backyard or in my back shed.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.880]   It's going to be there and it'll be used and it's still going to be just as good until
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.380]   we reach the end of its natural shelf life.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.280]   And that's the problem, of course, with commodities, that there are certain items that you can
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.760]   store for longer than others.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.680]   In the Alpha Strategy, John Pugsley talks about, for example, how long you can store
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   a pair of shoes.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.200]   Well, that'll depend on whether your shoes are made with needle and thread or whether
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.320]   your shoes are made with glue.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.340]   The glue will eventually start to break down.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.320]   He talks about how long you might be able to store canned food, of course, would be
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.040]   an obvious example, or how long you could store an extra set of tires for your car.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   And all of these kinds of things have certain shelf lives that can be extended to a certain
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.200]   degree, but there is a certain shelf life.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   And so you need to be thoughtful when you're approaching this subject as to how you're
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.480]   going to approach it so that you don't lose money.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.960]   Because the two big risks that you face when you're dealing with stockpiling of a commodity
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.640]   is the risk of loss due to something like theft or the risk of loss due to something
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   like a fire.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   A house fire can be catastrophic if you have tremendous stockpiles of stuff in your home,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.800]   and especially if it's not properly insured.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.520]   And then the second thing is the risk of obsolescence, either due to the product no longer functioning
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.160]   as you wanted to, maybe something better came along and this old version doesn't work anymore,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.420]   or just simply the product has become obsolete due to falling apart, decaying, etc.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.100]   And so Stephen is an extremely creative thinker, and he also has a great deal of experience
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.100]   in this field.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.600]   And we're going to talk about stockpiling commodities in ways that a lot of people don't
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   think about.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.440]   We're not going to talk much at all, probably, about gold and silver coins.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.680]   We're going to talk about other metals, other items as well.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.360]   So Steve, there's my introduction.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.920]   I'm looking forward to the conversation.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.840]   Okay, right away, I want to obliterate something that you mentioned about three times in your
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840]   intro.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   All right, go ahead.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.760]   And it's something a lot of people use, and it's used to marginalize experts and those
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.280]   in the sciences, and it's just something that is way too widely used.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.520]   I had someone use it on me the other day.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.080]   And anyways, the word is opinion.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.320]   I do not have an opinion.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   Joshua Sheets, you're not here listening to him on radical personal finance because you
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.560]   go, "Oh, Josh's opinion is so good."
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.740]   Josh does not have an opinion.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.500]   He has experience, expertise, and wisdom.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.560]   Now whether or not you like his experience, expertise, and wisdom, that's up to you.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   You can decide to dismiss it and everything else.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.920]   The guy panhandling on the street corner with the sign that says, "Want money for beer?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   Why lie?"
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   He's got an opinion.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.120]   You can ask him if he likes an apple or he likes an orange, and he'll give you his opinion
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   based upon what he likes.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:19.360]   Opinions come from people who do not have judgment, experience, expertise, information,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.880]   knowledge, wisdom, et cetera.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   It's used to marginalize the experts by those who do not have the ability.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.680]   And it's like, you know, Josh can say something extremely intelligent based upon something
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.080]   that he's done and tested.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.280]   It's like you went for an entire year on cash only, right?
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   I did.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.960]   You don't have an opinion on that.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.400]   You got an entire year of expertise.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.880]   You talk to someone and they go, "Well, that's just your opinion.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   That's just your opinion.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.920]   Why don't we let what other people think talk?"
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.800]   It's like, "Because other people didn't do what I did."
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.960]   And so if you're listening to radical personal finance, you're coming here for severe advice,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.200]   severe expertise, severe knowledge in a subject.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.080]   And that's what I'm bringing to Josh's show.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.640]   That's what Josh brings to the show every day.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:29.160]   So when you're considering, I mean, when you want me to help you with your entire estate
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.680]   and backup system and food and water and power, do you want to come to me for my opinion or
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.800]   you want to come to me for what I've been doing for 35 years with thousands of people?
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.360]   And I'll give just a quick plug, Steve, and then we'll get into the details.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.840]   I'll just give a quick plug for your work that over the years, the reason that I've
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.160]   consumed so much of your work, and I think I've probably consumed, I mean, I'm sure that
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.920]   you've done something I haven't consumed, but I've probably consumed almost everything
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.280]   you've put in publicly at least in the last seven or eight years.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.240]   And I have found you to be one of the most accurate thinkers and creative thinkers with
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.400]   good practical solutions to the problems discussed.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.280]   And it's been great because it's affected my life.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.480]   And then I've been able to take many of your concepts, add some of my own spin, share them
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.560]   with others, share them with some of my listeners and students, and then point people back to
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.200]   some of your resources as well.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.720]   But I admire some of the work that you've done.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.960]   Tell me a little bit about some of your—
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.640]   That's what I want people to do is I want them to listen to what I say.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.360]   Because look, you know, people are always asking me like, "Hey, I want a list of stuff
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.160]   to buy and I want to, you know, I got this whole pandemic shopping video."
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.920]   It's five hours of video broken up into 15 different videos between three minutes and
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.840]   58 minutes each.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.720]   It's me going out and doing shopping before the pandemic or disaster or whatever you want.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   And I say right there, "Look, my list is not your list.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   I'm not you.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.520]   I can't tell you what to get because I don't have four kids.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.880]   I don't, you know, I'm not 68 years old.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.280]   I'm not 18 years old.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.960]   I'm not you, but I can go through and I can show you what I got, why I got, what I didn't
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.880]   get, and why I didn't get it, and why you might get it.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.440]   And then you can use the knowledge and the examples I'm giving you and you can form your
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.140]   own conclusions for you.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.000]   And that's what I think is most – and that's what you did and that's what I think is most
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.440]   important, not following Stephen Harris doctrine.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.860]   It's, you know, listening to what I am telling you I've done and why I did it and forming
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.200]   your own conclusions the same way people listen to you for the same thing on finance.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.240]   And I'll add to your teaching style in terms of one of the things that you say as a teacher
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.800]   that you want people to do.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.280]   If you understand how to do something and you have experience, you can understand why
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:04.520]   something works, then you can be put into different situations and you know the concepts
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   that will work.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.040]   So, for example, Steve, you're probably most known, especially in the prepper world, you're
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.120]   most known for your skills and your knowledge in the area of energy preparedness, although
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.240]   of course your knowledge goes far beyond that.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:24.280]   But when I absorbed your lessons and whatnot on energy preparedness, then I was able to
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.960]   take those lessons and bring them into my own life.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.320]   And so I left the United States a year and a half, two years ago, and I left the United
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.240]   States with – I didn't take, you know, batteries and generators with me.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.960]   I left with about eight or nine suitcases and my children in tow and my family and we
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.080]   left.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.840]   And so I had to set up shop in a new country, in a third location that I don't talk a lot
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   about.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   I don't have Amazon.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.760]   I don't have the ability to say, "Oh, I've got to get this certain particular thing that
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   I need.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.960]   I don't have this certain part, this certain gadget."
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.600]   So what I had to do was when I was time to go ahead and start setting up my backups at
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.840]   my new location, I had to go to the store and start figuring out what's available where
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.240]   I am.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.760]   And because I had the concepts understood of what was available, I was able to go and
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.400]   put together a pretty decent, robust personal preparedness system covering all of the various
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   issues.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.000]   But I did it without ever going and looking at a shopping list of, "I have to buy this
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   certain item."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.600]   I went by what was available.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.720]   And I think that's the goal, that we want to absorb concepts at a deep enough level
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.520]   that you understand them so that you can go out and in almost any country and almost any
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.680]   place and almost any place that you find yourself, you can look around and see, "What resources
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.400]   do I have and then how can I adjust my use of those resources so that I can provide for
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.960]   my basic living needs?"
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:55.480]   Yeah, you sent me a picture the other day of a table outdoor in the beautiful weather
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.720]   and you said your power was out and you had a picture of two waffle makers and a Honda
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.960]   EU2200i generator.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   And it's like, "Well, what's that for?
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   He's going to make breakfast."
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.180]   It's like, "No, a waffle maker is the fastest food production machine you're pretty much
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.760]   going to find."
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:20.580]   Josh could make two and a half pounds of food every three minutes with a waffle maker.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.440]   And no, he doesn't have to use waffle mix and pancake mix.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.480]   There's a whole variety of different things you can make in it.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:34.660]   But he could make, let's see, well, two and a half pounds times 20.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.000]   That's about 42 and a half pounds of food an hour, edible food, ready to go in a Ziploc
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.520]   bag in your pocket, ready to put jam or jelly or syrup or honey or eat plain.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:56.560]   And he could have made that out of ground flour, ground corn, ground wheat, oats, rye,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.040]   rice, you name it.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.400]   It's a food production machine.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.200]   It's not something you'll only get at your local restaurant in the morning.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   Agreed.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.660]   All right, I want to focus us on the financial opportunities or the financial expressions
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.080]   of preparedness.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:21.020]   And let's start with food because I think that what we're talking about is useful, that
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.280]   food itself can be a commodity.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.800]   And in fact, it can be an extremely valuable commodity in many circumstances.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.880]   Number one, benefits of storing food.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.840]   Number one is that we all eat food.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.120]   And so if you store food that you might eventually eat and you put yourself in a situation where,
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.560]   okay, I'm not going to eat this right now, but I'm going to buy several months worth
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.760]   of food, I'm going to buy a year's worth of food, you are protecting yourself on a guaranteed
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.080]   basis from changes in your financial assets.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   And that food...
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   I did it.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   Tell us your story, Steve.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   I did it.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   I did it.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   I did it.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.040]   So, I was a research and development engineer for Chrysler Corporation in scientific labs.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.680]   And I worked on electric vehicles and I was knowledgeable in fuel cells and electrochemistry
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.760]   and the other stuff.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:21.060]   And I was there from '90 to 2000 and I went independent in 2000 and left the corporation
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:29.680]   because dare damn Germans came in of Daimler Chrysler and started ruining everything.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.960]   And I went independent and I was consulting to fuel cell car companies.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.480]   Fuel cells were a big thing back then and still have become a big thing.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.240]   But there were a lot of interests back then, especially with vehicles, and I had experience
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   in both of those.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.960]   And I was doing a bunch of consulting and flying to California and all that nice stuff.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.860]   And 9/11 happened.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.240]   And just like the pandemic, everything got put on hold for 9/11 only in business change,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:07.760]   only it was a different change than what we experienced recently.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.880]   So I had to make my mortgage payments still and everything else for my house.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:20.840]   And I found out about DirecTV installing and I went out and became the most overqualified
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.880]   DirecTV installer you ever saw.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.280]   But back in 2002, it was $100 per house I was doing the install on.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:35.200]   I didn't have to do very many of those to make a payment on a $600 mortgage because
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:43.640]   I bought a $78,000 house rather than the $144,000 house technically that my salary told me I
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   could afford.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.940]   And keep in mind, this was the early '90s.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.560]   So I was living below my means, which I think is something that you would recommend.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:01.360]   So I didn't have to do a lot to make my payment and I could continue to do my own work on
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.880]   the side, which is how I developed my publishing company, Knowledge Publications, but I got
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   really poor.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.520]   I mean, if I was going out and installing DirecTVs to pay my mortgage, I wasn't making
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.960]   a whole lot of money.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.760]   And I ended up eating my own food storage for about five, six months as a regular part
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   of my staple.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.280]   And I had part of my staple was white flour.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.160]   And I have a whole lecture, which I won't get into on white flour, but I had white flour.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.460]   And one of the things I like is biscuits.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.120]   So I made biscuits every day.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:45.720]   And I would take biscuits out with me in my pocket in a wrapper or a bag and munch on
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   them.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.240]   And I can make up dinner out of biscuits, biscuits and honey and butter and jam and
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.000]   jelly and peanut butter.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.840]   And I would make my own bread, but I just preferred to make biscuits.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.160]   Biscuits were nice and simple.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:07.320]   And so, yeah, I mean, a fair amount of my caloric intake was I ate my own food storage.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:15.280]   And at that time, my food storage would have been stored for a good eight years at least.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.320]   And it's not called food storage, it's called food insurance.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.520]   So there are things that you can buy.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.080]   I mean, there's things you can buy that have a very infinite shelf life to them.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.680]   And they're more valuable to you in the sense that you're feeding yourself or you're feeding
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.360]   your friends and your neighbors, because in a disaster, the people that come over, your
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.680]   friends and your neighbors are the resource in a disaster.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.040]   And they're not a hindrance, because you always need extra hands, extra bodies, someone to
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.160]   stay awake at night and keep a lookout and wake you up if something happens, be on watch.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.560]   So that food insurance is good for you and good for others.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.480]   Now, remember, just because you might be eating some of the Mountain House freeze-dried really
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.000]   good stuff and the freeze-dried ice cream every day, that doesn't mean the people coming
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.040]   over and helping are eating the same thing you're eating.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.160]   They can be eating the rice, the beans, and the other things that are cheaper that you
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.800]   stored and put away.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.560]   And if they don't eat it on the first day they're there, I guarantee you they're going
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.760]   to eat it on the second day that they're there.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.540]   And they'll be happy for it.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:41.880]   But as far as the commodity, foods are generally first and foremost to provide you with calories,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   not nutrition.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.560]   If you're worried about nutrition, what I say is shut up and take a multivitamin, and
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:54.000]   you'll have all the nutrition that you need.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.720]   What you're after is calories to do daily work, existing, not being hungry, et cetera.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.760]   But there's a few foods that you can put away that would be a 20-year or 30-year commodity.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.840]   The only one I can think of that would be perfect-- well, there's two of them, actually.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.120]   Well, three of them.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.640]   Sugar, honey, and salt.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   Both last forever.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.920]   And you go, oh, sugar?
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   Sugar?
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.000]   Yeah, sugar stores forever, just like honey.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.520]   It's basically almost the same thing except for a different form.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.360]   Excuse me.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.480]   Honey just has a lot higher dollar value associated, which is pretty good.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:46.600]   I got 10 gallons of honey stored, and the story is I got it for really basically for
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.120]   free.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.680]   But if you're going to put money into something that other people would want, five-gallon
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.560]   buckets of honey, they're like $200, $300, depending upon what type you get.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.680]   And they'll still be worth $200, $300 in 10 years from now on an inflationary adjusted
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.440]   basis.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.280]   Salt is always going to be salt.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.080]   It'll never be anything else but salt.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   It'll never go bad.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.760]   However, salt generally goes for like $50 a ton.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.160]   So it's very, very bulky and heavy, and it's a widely available commodity.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:33.200]   So I wouldn't recommend of it for financial storage, but it's good for-- I mean, there's
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:38.760]   only a certain amount of it you can store, like a five-gallon bucket will last you a
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.760]   lifetime.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.840]   But if we were talking about storage of a commodity, what we're basically talking about
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:54.120]   is we're going to cover different places to park your money that actually allow you to
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:01.600]   keep pace with inflation and/or ways of getting these things so you actually have an economic
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   gain at the end of a period of time, whether it's a preparedness item or not, that you
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.000]   might not have thought of.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.680]   And thus, these things are going to be a little bit more fluffy.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.840]   They're going to be a little bit-- you're going to need to have space for storage.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.240]   You're going to need to have a place to put them.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.920]   If you're living in a two-bedroom apartment, it's not really going to work for you.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.320]   But it might be something you keep in your mind for when you finally get out of the apartment
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.040]   and/or you find a space location where you can put stuff of value.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.000]   Steve, I want to ask you a question about salt.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.760]   In what form factor-- so honey, I think the form factor that's obvious and works great
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.480]   is the five-gallon buckets.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.120]   All my life growing up, we always had a friend of ours who was a beekeeper.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.480]   And I don't remember how often it was, but on occasion, we would buy a five-gallon bucket
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.080]   or two of honey from him.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.480]   And that was the way that my mom saved money, was just buying five gallons at a time.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   And it's great.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   It's just a five-gallon bucket.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.060]   It comes directly, ready to go, and as you say, stores forever.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.120]   What form factor would you use to stockpile salt if you were going to stockpile some?
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.920]   Oh, well, salt likes to absorb water and become hard.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   It's hydroscopic.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.680]   In fact, depending upon the salt you get, it's also called deliasquin.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.720]   But you're not generally eating that salt.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.920]   We're talking about sodium chloride.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:34.280]   So excuse me, something's got in my throat, and it's not the coronavirus.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:40.560]   But no, something completely hermetically sealed, five-gallon bucket, two-and-a-half-gallon
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.360]   pail, one-gallon paint can.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:54.080]   Definitely not the paper item that you buy the salt in the store, either the Morton salt
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.480]   tube or the bag of pickling salt.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:06.240]   I buy my salt from Gordon Food Service, and it's 25 pounds of Morton-type of salt, I mean
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.880]   regular granular salt, that is ready to use.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.040]   And it's $8.25 for 25 pounds.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:20.960]   I just pour that into a five-gallon pail, fill up the five-gallon pail, and you got
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.840]   a darn heavy bucket of salt.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.320]   I make sure it's hermetically sealed.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:32.200]   And depending on how long I'm storing something, I knock down the lid with a rubber hammer,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:38.600]   and sometimes I put a piece of silicone tape all the way around it.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.960]   So that's just the best way to store it.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.600]   - Okay, give a short, as we move through some of these food groups, 'cause I want you to
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:52.820]   cover sugar in a moment, but give a short lecture on how to, if you're gonna, let's
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.040]   say you're gonna get a bucket, right?
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.360]   You're gonna find a supply of buckets, and you're going to fill a few buckets with salt,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.520]   knowing how valuable it is, and I'm gonna spend $50 on salt, I'm gonna fill five five-gallon
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.800]   buckets.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.100]   How do you treat those buckets?
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.280]   Talk about oxygen absorbers and how to make sure that it's hermetically sealed for a long
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.160]   period, and what's necessary for these different foods, please.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   - Well, you know the word "salary" comes from the word "salt," don't you?
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   - Yes.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:27.720]   - At one time, Roman soldiers actually got paid partially in salt, and that's where the
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.960]   term "earning your salt" comes from.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.000]   Salt was a very valuable commodity in the days of old.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.800]   It was carried by camel and other beasts of burden thousands of miles from where it was
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.360]   harvested to the marketplace where it was sold.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.440]   Salt is sodium chloride.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.840]   It is over a billion years old.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.400]   It is not gonna spoil, it is not gonna go bad.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.840]   The oxygen of the air does not affect it.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:07.480]   You take a clean five-gallon pail, not wet, clean and dry, just wipe it out with a towel
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:14.080]   or whatever, pour the salt in, put the lid on, smash it down with a rubber mallet so
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.840]   it's got a good seal on it, and you're done.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:26.400]   There are no oxygen absorbers or nitrogen or CO2 flushes needed for salt or sugar or
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.880]   honey in the least.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.040]   All three of them are preservatives.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.280]   My ex-wife, I drive me crazy.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.960]   Every time I turn around, I go, "Where's the jelly?"
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.600]   It was in the fricking refrigerator.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.920]   And it's like, it doesn't need to go into the--.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   Well, it says refrigerate over opening, and it's like, that's for stupid people.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.080]   It's all sugar.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.520]   It's a preservative.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.240]   It's not going bad.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:09.160]   And people who put peanut butter, jelly, honey, and vanilla, and vanilla is mostly ethyl alcohol,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.040]   into the refrigerator drives me crazy.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.360]   I have a housekeeper that comes over, and she's Chinese.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.520]   Yes, I have a Chinese housekeeper.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.240]   And I say, and she comes and puts everything in, and I go, "Look."
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.720]   And I listed off all the stuff.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.400]   None of this goes into the refrigerator.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   She goes, "Why not?
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   It'll spoil."
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.800]   And I go, "No, it won't spoil.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.200]   Don't fill up my refrigerator with things that don't need to be filled up."
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   And plus, it's harder to get out of the container when it's cold.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   Right.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.520]   How did you get 10 gallons of honey for free, in terms of saving actual money, but getting
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.520]   stuff for free?
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.520]   How did you do that?
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.400]   I became a recycler.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.720]   And I forgot how we found it, but we found this--.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   Oh, I know.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.280]   I got a guy I buy barrels and drums from.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.640]   And he contacted me and said, "There's a bakery, and they got a bunch of barrels and
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:18.200]   drums of honey that's partially crystallized, and they can't get it out.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:23.320]   And I want to know if you can get it out for me so I can have the barrels and the drums."
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   And I go, "What do you got?"
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.400]   And he goes, "10 barrels, 55-gallon drums of honey."
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   And I go, "Well, take it!"
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.280]   And he brought them all over, and we thought they were half full, but they weren't.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.680]   They turned out to be an eighth to a quarter full, mostly more towards an eighth full,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.820]   but still an eighth of 55 gallons is a lot.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.720]   So I got a bunch of my friends together from a Facebook preparedness group, and we had
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.740]   a party at Harris House.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.760]   And we had to buy a drum de-litter, which is like a big can opener for a drum that takes
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.880]   the lid off of a drum.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:10.440]   And we opened it all up, looked at it, and it was crystallized.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.400]   And what we did was we took a great big paint mixer on a heavy-duty drill, I mean the type
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.080]   of drill you have to hold with two hands, and we mixed it all up so it was homogenized
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.360]   and so it would flow.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.280]   Because there was honey and there was crystals in there, and all we did was mix it.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:34.440]   And then we would upend the one barrel upside down, leaning against the fence against a
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:42.200]   clean barrel, and we just let all the honey slowly drain out while we were working on
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.360]   the other barrels.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:51.840]   And then we washed out that barrel, and we got the honey out, we scraped the rest out,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.480]   and we washed it out with water, and so we had a mix of honey and water, and that went
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.440]   into another barrel.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.920]   So we kept upending the barrels, and we ended up getting 60 gallons of honey, and we all
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   split it up.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.640]   So that's how I ended up with 10 gallons of honey.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:16.920]   Now we had about another 25 gallons of honey and wash water, which we knew the concentration
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.440]   of because we weighed the barrels before and after, and we knew the weight of the barrel.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.080]   So we knew the weight of the honey, and I actually measured the amount of water going
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.640]   in so I know the weight of the water.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.760]   Well, now we know our honey and water mixture, and some of my buddies, they like making mead,
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:41.320]   which is basically honey wine or beer made from honey.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.880]   All you do is pitch some yeast and keep it warm and let it ferment, and you got one of
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.240]   the oldest alcoholic drinks ever made.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:57.240]   So they took that home, and they made the mead and left me with the 10 gallons of honey.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.600]   So I found a valuable resource.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.560]   Yeah, it's probably $400 in honey.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.760]   Technically it's USDA organic.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:17.040]   It was labeled such, and I know it came from India/Pakistan, but nevertheless, it's still
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   good honey.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   It's a good story.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.880]   I looked at the pictures and can prove it.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   We had a ball.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   Nice.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.480]   Let's talk now about sugar.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.400]   Your preparedness doesn't need to be miserable.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.920]   Your preparedness needs to be fun.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.840]   And we all re-crystallized it.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.560]   The best way to re-crystallize honey is at about 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:43.480]   I got a Cabela's dehydrating oven, countertop appliance.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   It's kind of tall.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.680]   It's like 18 inches tall.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.560]   It can hold like 12 trays.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:53.320]   I just took the trays out, and I put in the half gallons of honey in half-gallon mason
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   jars.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:01.480]   And I just ran it at 140 with two half-gallons in there overnight until I...
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.240]   Well, actually, I just re-crystallized two half-gallon mason jars.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.720]   The rest is crystallized.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.920]   And when I want to re-crystallize, un-crystallize it back into a raw, syrupy type of honey,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.760]   people go, "Oh, that's freezer-burned.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   It's bad."
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.440]   It's like, there's no such thing as freezer-burned.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.600]   Those are just ice crystals.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   Big deal.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.000]   I mean, heat it, cook it, it's just fine.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.480]   And they say, "Oh, your honey's gone bad."
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.920]   No, the sugar is just combined into crystalline forms as it wants to do.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.520]   All you do is heat it up.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.080]   And you can heat it up in a bath of warm water.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   You can heat it on the stove.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   You can heat it up in the oven.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.040]   You can heat it up in a food dehydrator.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.360]   You just want to get it above 140, and it'll all melt back down together.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.680]   And there you go.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.760]   Let's talk about sugar now.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.440]   I think sugar is an interesting thing to store, because as you say, it stores forever.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.760]   It's a preservative.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.480]   You can use it to preserve fruits and make lovely jams and jellies.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:10.880]   And even in terms of an overall food preparedness regimen, sugar on top of bread makes everything
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.760]   go down easier, and it's useful to have.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   The thing I like about sugar is that, especially if sugar is stored in quantity, and if you
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.840]   have some other equipment, sugar can be transformed into things that are quite valuable, especially
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.200]   during hard times.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   So talk about storing sugar, the methodology, and some of the things you could do with stored
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   sugar.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.480]   Okay, sugar, the big thing about it is, again, it's mildly hydroscopic.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.440]   It wants to absorb moisture from the air and become solid.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.640]   And it's not bad when it becomes solid.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:48.880]   It just becomes a pain in the butt, because you got to break it up and regranulate it.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.760]   And a blender works good for that.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.040]   I mean, a hammer and a chisel, and then you throw the hunks of it into a blender, turn
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.840]   it back into powdered sugar that you then use.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:05.600]   But sugar is really good for jams and jellies.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.840]   It's needed for baking, because you need it for yeast to eat, to make carbon dioxide to
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.560]   make your bread rise.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:23.080]   It adds sweetness and a taste to things that would generally be regularly not as palatable
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.520]   or not as pleasantly palatable.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.320]   I believe you should be a spectator in disaster, like you're a spectator in a football game,
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.680]   sitting there and fans eating hot dogs and drinking beer and talking with your friends
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.000]   and watching the game on the gridiron, rather than being one of the idiots on the gridiron
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.560]   slamming into other idiots with helmets and shoulder pads.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.560]   They're participants.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.760]   You want to be spectators.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.520]   So you want to be a spectator in the disaster, watching everyone.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.960]   You watch a person floating down the river at high speed, barely keeping up above the
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.400]   water, and you go, "Oh, I bet that sucks."
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.160]   And then they're gone.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.560]   Call 911.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.240]   But so you were a spectator.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.320]   That other person was a participant.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.120]   Participants only become one of two things.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.840]   They either become survivors or they become victims, decedents, dead.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.400]   And just because, you know, the second you crawl out of the river naked and make it to
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.680]   the bank, it's like, "Oh, I finally made it out of the river."
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.720]   Well, you're still a long ways away from any help or civilization in the woods.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.520]   You just crawled out of the river naked.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:41.280]   So now, congratulations, you are a participant in another survival experience, making it
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.240]   to help, naked, after crawling out of a river.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.960]   So thus, you want to be the spectator.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:54.880]   Sugar, it does have a need, a trading commodity value.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.400]   One of the things you can do with it, you can easily turn sugar into soft and hard candy,
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.040]   which is going to be small, compact, and dense.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:14.200]   And it is going to have a trading value in a post-apocalyptic or disaster type of situation.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.480]   I carry hard candies in a bug out bag and everything else just to share with other people.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.640]   If I ever wind up in a shelter, I mean, a hard candy will definitely make people, you
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.680]   know, smile for five or ten minutes.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.160]   The other thing you can do with sugar is you can make moonshine.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.320]   And I have an entire instructional video on this.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.600]   It's very easy.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.520]   No, you don't need to have the pods in the still.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.880]   I mean, the device I use is basically a simple, looks like a coffee maker.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:50.240]   And you can distill alcohol directly from sugar after processed by yeast.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.920]   No, you don't need corn.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.320]   No, you don't need mash.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.920]   No, you don't need wheat.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.120]   No, you don't need to be out in the woods.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.200]   No, you can do it on your kitchen table.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:09.560]   In fact, all ethanol is come from, all organic ethanol made by a biological process comes
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:14.040]   from yeast eating a monosaccharide sugar.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040]   Starch is a polysaccharide.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:21.800]   And you turn starch like corn into a monosaccharide by heating it and treating it with malted
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.720]   barley or alpha amylase and glucoamylase enzymes to break it down into a monosaccharide so
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.880]   the yeast can eat it.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.840]   So all yeast comes from sugar, whether that's starch converted to sugar or whether that's
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.000]   sugar to start with.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.400]   The easy button is just buy the damn sugar at Walmart or Costco.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   No one's going to look at you twice for buying 500 pounds or 1,000 pounds of sugar.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:51.320]   Besides, just make up a little company, do a DBA and call it Joshua's Hard Candy and
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   Sweets.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.520]   It's like, buy underneath that name.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.800]   You're buying sugar to make candy, even if you're making ethanol moonshine out of it.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:08.440]   But really, the moonshine, since ethanol never, ever spoils, you are by far better buying
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.000]   sugar and making the moonshine and storing it.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.800]   I advocate you store it in water bottles.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:23.640]   Buy the little, and you want to do the eight-ounce bottles, not the 16-ounce bottles from Sam's
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.920]   Club or Costco or wherever you give them.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:31.040]   Yeah, just pour the water into your mash and make your, actually it's called a wort, and
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:37.480]   make your wort out of it and distill it and then put the ethanol back into the bottles,
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.520]   only you put a little black dot on the cap so you know it's ethanol.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:49.560]   You put it in there about 100 proof, and eight ounces is about three and a half, four and
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.040]   a half shots.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.080]   So basically, eight ounces is one really good drunk.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:02.920]   You can trade that away all day long, anywhere in the world.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.360]   I'll tell you something really interesting.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.320]   I'm a consultant to different elements of government and special forces, which people
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   know.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:23.120]   I got this one entire group and team to, they always carry a multi-fuel stove, a pressurized
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:34.160]   one, and it runs on diesel, kerosene, gasoline, you know, Avgas, Jet A. It runs on almost
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.760]   any liquid fuel, but it doesn't run on alcohol.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:46.000]   And so there'll be like a 12-man ODA, and two or three of them will have the stove with
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.360]   them, but another two or three will have a simple, what you see online as the brass alcohol
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.520]   stove.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:01.000]   All you do is pour in the denatured ethanol or marine fuel, which is denatured ethanol,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.400]   and it's a simple little alcohol stove.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:09.880]   Alcohol stoves are just simplicity, they're just so simple.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:15.080]   It's a little bit more expensive of fuel, but they just work so beautiful.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:20.400]   So they'll carry that, and they were carrying denatured ethanol that you get at Home Depot
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.600]   as a backup fuel, about a pint of it or two pints of it.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.960]   And what it is, it's 98% ethanol and 2% methanol.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:38.040]   It's called denatured, so it's not natural, so you can't drink it because it will literally
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.080]   make you sick or blind or poison you if you drink denatured alcohol.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   And I told the guys, "No, no, stop doing that."
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   They go, "Why?
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   What?"
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.760]   I go, "Go get Everclear."
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:56.900]   In the United States and most states, not all states, you can buy 190 or 195 proof ethanol.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:02.860]   And so that is basically 95% ethanol, and the rest is water.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:09.540]   In some states, it's 150 proof, and it won't work, but if you can get 190 proof ethanol,
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.460]   Everclear, I said, "Carry that as your stove fuel."
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.260]   I said, "And it's actually cheaper than the marine alcohol."
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.900]   Wait, no, the marine alcohol is cheaper.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.900]   But anyways, I told them to carry this, and they go, "Why?"
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:32.980]   I go, "Well, one, you can medically use it to disinfect things, needles, sutures, wounds,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   et cetera.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.540]   Two, you can use it as a stove fuel just beautifully.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:42.620]   Three, you can use it as a trading or barter item.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:49.220]   And four, you can use it as a trading or barter item because you can drink it."
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:55.260]   And I said, "Let's say you get into a bad situation.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.140]   You get a bullet through the leg.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.460]   Your buddies do T-Trips-C on you.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:09.780]   They put a tourniquet on you, bandage you up, and you guys now have to do a three-legged
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.300]   race for the helicopter.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:18.100]   That's three and a half kilometers away, and you are in, oh my God, horrible pain, and
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.100]   your medic's not there.
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.700]   There's usually two medics and an ODA."
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:29.820]   And I said, "Now you got something that has been historically a proven anesthetic for
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.300]   severe pain.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.540]   And it's like you can drink that alcohol, and you can get yourself a little bit drunk
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.580]   or a lot drunk depending upon your medical situation, and it might allow you to overcome
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:45.380]   the amount of pain that you have to get through to make it to your ex fill.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.860]   Otherwise, you're going to become a prisoner or dead."
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   And these are people operating in hostile areas.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.220]   It's not big army or the big Marine Corps.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:08.420]   So there's an example of what you can do with ethanol as a commodity or as a storage device.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.880]   You can use it as dope fuel.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.980]   You can use it trading and bartering.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.020]   You can use it as a medical disinfectant.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.740]   You can use it as an internal analgesic.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.740]   - Right.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:24.700]   That's what I like about the idea of thinking about things that you could store.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:31.900]   So I don't buy much into the idea that the world, there's this idea that some people
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:37.300]   have that, "Well, everything after the zombie apocalypse, then we go back to 1800s technology."
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:43.980]   I don't buy into that idea, but I do know that there can be times when society as normal,
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.820]   it doesn't exist for quite a while.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.540]   And if you want to find one of the historically most valuable things to have, alcohol has
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.900]   always been at the top of that list.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.140]   And so if you think about the value and you say, "Well, maybe I could store some sugar."
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.900]   In a moment, we'll talk about putting money into alcohol itself, like alcohol that other
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.720]   people have made, but the cheapest way to do it is, as you say, you store the sugar,
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:13.580]   you possibly go ahead and distill the alcohol yourself and store it, and that can have significant
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.980]   value, and is really worth considering as one reason to store significant amounts of
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   sugar and also to accumulate the appropriate equipment that would allow you to properly
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   distill it safely.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.580]   >>Ted: I would not do it post-event.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   I would not make alcohol post-event.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:44.220]   The type of alcohol I would make post-event is what they do up in Alaska, because a lot
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:56.900]   of the Inuit city areas up there are dry, is you can take yeast and sugar and water,
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.580]   and you can make a wine.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:06.220]   You just ferment it, and it makes a wine/a beer, whatever you want to call it, and you
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.260]   can drink it straight.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:14.740]   It's going to be about 11% to 16% ethanol, depending upon the yeast.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:20.220]   If you use Red Star Baking Yeast, it's going to be about 11% alcohol, and you can drink
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.420]   that directly.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:30.620]   I would not use my valuable energy for distillation of that post-apocalyptic, because your energy
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:37.420]   is by far too valuable, and don't go, "Well, what if I got a solar panel?"
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.020]   It takes a fair amount of energy to distill.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.940]   It takes a fair amount of energy to distill ethanol.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.700]   I would not use solar power, solar energy, gasoline.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:55.340]   If you had an abundance of hydroelectric, sure, but other than that, no.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:02.500]   It takes a lot more energy than energy you have in your battery bank to distill even
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.860]   one gallon of ethanol.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:10.700]   So, on the same theme of things that store forever, most distilled spirits will basically
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.060]   store forever, and some distilled spirits can actually grow in value.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.940]   I noticed an interesting headline a couple weeks ago, beginning of September.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:24.900]   The headline is, "Son sells birthday whiskey collection worth over $53,000 to buy his first
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.380]   house."
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:32.140]   His father, basically every year, spent about $6,000 total over 28 years, and he would give
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:37.260]   his son a bottle of McCollin single malt whiskey as a birthday gift.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.520]   He did this from the very beginning, and at this point in time, he now has a collection
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.860]   worth about $53,000, which he's planning to sell through a broker, through an auction
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:54.860]   of some kind, and be able to use that money for paying a down payment on his first house.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:46:02.460]   So, Steve, what thoughts do you have around storing distilled spirits as a way of having
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.420]   inflation-proof assets?
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.060]   Sounds pretty bad to me.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:13.220]   Six thousand times 20 is 120,000, and he's selling it for 50,000.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.220]   Sounds like a bad investment to me.
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.220]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.300]   It was $6,000 total.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:22.660]   All of the bottles have cost about $6,000, so the $6,000 spent, because of the time that
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:29.260]   they had sat on the shelf, the $6,000 had grown to be worth about $53,000 in today's
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.260]   dollars.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.180]   No, I wouldn't do that.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:40.100]   The only thing I would buy is, if you want to buy a bunch of Costco vodka really cheap
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.980]   and have it as something, you can't put enough money.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:51.580]   It builds up too much space in terms of volume versus dollars, which is what's nice about
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.860]   gold is that one ounce is small and you've got a lot of monetary value into it.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:01.820]   The problem with it is it's small and you've got a lot of monetary value into it.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:08.500]   You can't make change with a bar of gold, but you're really not going to make money
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.900]   on gold or silver.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:16.220]   It's just an inflationary-proof place to park your money for 10, 20, 30 years or more or
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:22.220]   to pass it on to another generation.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.980]   If you happen to make money on it, great.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.940]   I know a lot of people have lost a lot of money on gold and silver.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.100]   People are losing money on gold and silver right now and people are making money on gold
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.060]   and silver right now.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:39.140]   The whole idea of, "Oh, well, in a disaster, I'm going to go take my gold and silver and
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.340]   trade it for a loaf of bread."
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.780]   No, you're not.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.660]   Stop listening to the idiots on the net.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:53.180]   I know people that have gone through the entire inflationary period and the collapse of Venezuela
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:57.540]   and people who have escaped Venezuela and gone to other countries.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.540]   I dealt with people working for me doing web work and other type of work.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.540]   He was an MD.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.580]   He was a doctor.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:11.860]   He was making more money working for me for pennies than he could make in Venezuela.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:24.340]   You can't buy a loaf of bread with an ounce of gold if there's no loaves of bread.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.180]   Don't think there's anyone that's going to trade you a loaf of bread for an ounce of
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.700]   gold because they won't because they're hungry.
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:35.580]   Hungry is one of the most powerful motivators.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:44.700]   After thirst and breathing, hunger is one of the most powerful motivators of human beings.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:51.660]   When he left and his parents were still there trying to get entry visas into other countries,
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.740]   she would have about one meal a day.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.660]   She'd get two gallons of gasoline every three days.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.540]   That was allotted to her.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   She would wait four to six hours each time for that two to three gallons of gasoline.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.460]   There was nothing in the stores.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:13.380]   There was no currency because the currency was devalued beyond description.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.300]   There was no one buying trading with gold or silver.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.300]   None.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.300]   Zero.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:26.260]   If you don't have it before a disaster, you're not going to get it during or after.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:32.220]   That includes your food, your water, and your other needed supplies.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:37.260]   I paid him electronically through a system called Payoneer.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.100]   It's like a worldwide version of PayPal.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.220]   I paid him through Payoneer.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.100]   He went to a black market person.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.980]   He transferred the money to him in Payoneer.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:58.220]   Then the black market guy transferred his money to his bank account in Venezuela.
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.260]   Everything was purchased on debit cards.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.700]   Everyone used debit cards.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:07.220]   Everything was purchased with debit cards because the inflationary index was already
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:13.260]   accommodated for that day in the bank transfer.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:18.860]   He actually used his debit card so much over a period of two and a half years that wore
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.860]   out.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.060]   I said, "Go get a new debit card."
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:26.140]   He goes, "Yeah, well, I'll have to be in the bank waiting all day."
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.460]   I go, "Take a good look.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.300]   You need to have a working debit card."
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.820]   He only had one.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.380]   You can't buy food or anything.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:42.380]   You can't buy anything without your debit card in Venezuela at the time, which became
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.740]   really bad when they had the countrywide power failure.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:51.980]   Then they couldn't even use their debit card.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.300]   Everything was done by debit card.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.900]   I asked him, "What would you do if you had gold or silver?"
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.620]   He said, "I'd have to take it to the black market guy to get it transferred and put into
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:07.500]   my bank account as monetary units in my bank account to use my debit card to go buy something."
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.460]   He says, "He would charge me more than half."
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:18.660]   If you had $1,000 US dollars in gold, he would only give you $500 for it because it was such
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:24.140]   a pain in the rear end for him to try to turn that back into something that was useful to
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.460]   him as a black market person, some type of fiat.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:35.180]   This myth of, "I'm going to go buy my bread and my stuff with my gold and silver is in
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:42.140]   I'm buying these little pieces I can break off into one gram slices and I'm buying one
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.860]   tenth ounce gold pieces."
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.820]   Bull crap, bull crap, bull crap, bull crap, bull crap.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.340]   It's not going to get you nothing.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:56.060]   In fact, during the pandemic in the United States, you couldn't buy stuff.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.060]   It just wasn't there.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:01.140]   You went to the grocery store and there just was no bread.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.740]   There just was no meat.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.980]   There was no milk.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.300]   There was no eggs.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.500]   Depending upon where you were and what time during the pandemic, there was none.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:16.580]   We are fortunate as hell that we had power and that we had electricity.
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.580]   We had gasoline.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.580]   We had electricity.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.220]   Imagine the pandemic without gasoline and without electricity.
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:28.260]   It would have been a lot more and not being able to go to the store, not being able to
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.340]   go to the pharmacy.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:34.820]   One of the things we were going to talk about, Josh, was other forms of commodities that
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:39.340]   you could store dollars in.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.940]   You're looking for places to park your money.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:47.180]   It's like a slow drizzle that fills up your rain bucket.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.300]   We're not looking at a thunderstorm.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:55.260]   We're not looking at trying to move your life savings of $600,000 into gold or into silver,
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:00.700]   which is absolutely kind of impossible to do at the moment, even if you wanted to, which
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:06.900]   is why you talk about how to survive the upcoming financial problems by using foreign banks
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   and different banks.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.820]   You got a whole beautiful strategy worked out for it.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.260]   But there are things that you can get.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.780]   If you got space, there are things that you can get that are reasonably dense that you
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:25.700]   can park your money in and you can get them for a bargain.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:34.900]   You actually might make money on them in 10 or 20 years when you go to cash them in.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:40.780]   You're not going to be just like cashing these things in on the street.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:45.380]   It's not like you're going to be able to go to liquid instantly, but you're going to be
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:49.580]   able to go to liquid and go to profit.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.660]   But it's not like, "Hey man, I got some silver.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.760]   You want to buy it?"
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:02.500]   You might be going to a company or to a market or to a scrapyard or something and turning
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.660]   it in.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.060]   Some of it might take you a month to convert it.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.060]   Some of it might take you a day to convert it.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:18.860]   But this started, I do a lot of work in the industrial world and I was on Facebook Marketplace,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.580]   which is a great place to buy stuff.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.660]   It's basically taken over Craigslist.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:33.020]   And this guy had billets of a special stainless steel that's used on a CNC or a lathe or a
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.740]   mill to make stuff.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:43.820]   And they were about six inches long by four inches by four inches.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:49.180]   And they were a specific type of labeled stainless steel.
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:56.980]   And anyways, he said they were $144 brand new.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:01.540]   And Detroit is a fairly industrial area where I live.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:07.300]   And he says he wanted $70 for each of them each.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:13.860]   And obviously he was selling them to people who wanted them for their own CNC or mill
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.720]   work.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.820]   And I was looking at it and I was like, "Gee, I bet you if I bought them all, I could get
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.100]   them for 50 bucks each."
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:29.020]   So brand new, 144 in year 2020, selling them at basically half price.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.420]   I could probably get them even cheaper.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.740]   And what you need...
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.100]   And there was like $10,000 of them.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:38.100]   He had 200 of them.
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.580]   And so $10,000 of them at $50 each.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:48.740]   Well, if I had a spare $10,000, that was like a small fraction of my income that I wanted
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   to park.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.580]   And we're talking what, what would you say, Josh, 1% or 2% of your income, 1% of your
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.820]   income that you wanted to park.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:03.380]   So whether that was $1,000 or $10,000 or $150,000, that's up to you.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.140]   I could have bought these billets of steel.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.920]   Now you want the certs with them.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.780]   You want the sheet that comes with them that says what they are.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:15.340]   And usually they're going to be marked with a paint pen that says 3003 on them or whatever
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:21.140]   the type of steel or metal that they are made out of and what their formulation is.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.180]   And you want the certs or the XRFs that come with them.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.180]   But that's fine.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:32.220]   You can take those and you can just put a coating of WD-40 on them and you can put them
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:37.740]   into a plastic tote that you hermetically seal with tape.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:44.100]   So no moisture gets in there and corrodes them past their WD-40 coating.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:50.460]   And if you got a barn or a place to store them, bury them, whatever you want, in 10
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:58.660]   or 20 years from now, those things are still going to be worth $144 times the inflationary
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:04.740]   adjustment for when you go to sell them.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:11.140]   So they might be worth $215 or $250 each in 10 or 20 years.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.180]   But it is a commodity.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.180]   It is steel.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:20.100]   And it is a specific flavor of steel that has a higher value to it because it's used
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:26.180]   in the machining business for the manufacture and making of parts from custom machining
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.180]   shops or something.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:31.820]   Now, can you just go down the street and say, "Hey, dude, I'll trade you this hunk of stainless
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.380]   steel for bread."
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.500]   It's like, "No."
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   But we're not talking about that.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:44.500]   We're talking about parking money for an inflationary proof storage and/or an inflationary proof
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.300]   storage plus profit method.
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:51.780]   Now it's a roll of the dice whether or not you're going to make your money beyond inflationary
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.660]   adjustment on gold or silver, right?
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.660]   Correct.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.100]   It all has to do with demand.
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.100]   Right.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:03.020]   No, I mean, this is a regular commodity that is always going to be in demand even 20 years
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.020]   from now.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:09.740]   And if you got the room, you can buy it and you can store it.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:15.100]   And it's a place to park some money other than gold and silver.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.180]   And this, like I said, this will probably have return on it.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:24.180]   One of the other good things is I deal with scrappers and they go and scrap things and
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.980]   they take it to the recycle yard and get money for it.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:37.260]   Well, I tell the scrappers that I want bar stock copper, like the copper that comes out
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:42.380]   of the back of a big industrial circuit breaker panel.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.620]   Not the thin stuff, not copper wire.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:52.380]   I want stock bar stock copper and I'll pay them 10% over what Great Lakes Recycling will
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.380]   give them.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.540]   And to be honest, I don't want fluffy copper.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.860]   I want dense copper.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.740]   I want copper that's easy to store.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:07.740]   So I'm buying it at recycle price, which is well below commodity price.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:15.220]   And it's in a stocky method and I already have an industrial shop and a storage unit.
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:20.220]   So I got a place to put my copper.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:31.180]   And if you took a priority mail mailer box and filled it full of copper, and I have,
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.380]   you can barely lift it.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.940]   It's like 80 pounds.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.960]   Copper is a dense metal.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:43.500]   Now that copper I can take to any scrap yard in the country and they will give me cash
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.500]   for it.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.880]   And there's scrap yards in every city, everywhere that you go.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:57.060]   So I can turn my copper back into cash and I can have an inflationary proof method of
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.300]   storage for my money.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.540]   That is not gold.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.340]   That is not silver.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.900]   That has what we call a completely different signature to it.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.860]   I mean, gold or silver, you're only going to sell it to a private person or you're going
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.860]   to sell it to a dealer.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.180]   And you're going to have to find a dealer or a private party.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.100]   And depending upon the dealer, if it's a coin deal or something, you're going to lose a
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:24.300]   certain amount of money above spot to get it.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:29.440]   And he's going to pay you a certain amount of money below spot for it.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:35.680]   And depending upon the amount of money, there may or may not be a paper trail behind that
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.060]   that you may or may not want, depending upon how you were doing your business and your
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.080]   personal finances.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.980]   So copper is good for that.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.380]   In the world of copper, there's bright copper, number one copper, number two copper.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.300]   Bright copper is stripped copper wire.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.020]   Number one copper is copper from copper wire.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.440]   And number two copper is like copper pipe.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.080]   And any other type of copper, enameled copper, et cetera.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.260]   And wire is fluffy.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.460]   There's a lot of airspace in wire.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:18.460]   And that's why I wanted the bar stock, because it's already as densified as I'm going to
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.420]   get it unless I melt it and cast it.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:26.340]   Melting and casting copper is a world of difference from melting and casting aluminum, because
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:32.420]   it's melt and pour temperatures up around 2,000, whereas aluminum is between 1,200 and
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   1,400.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:38.700]   Speaking of aluminum, I would not recommend the storage of aluminum, because it becomes
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.020]   what we call too fluffy.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.780]   It is too cheap and it takes up too much space.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.920]   Right now, aluminum is about 30 cents a pound at the scrap yard.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:53.780]   And that is an awful lot of volume of aluminum to be able to store and turn back into the
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.340]   scrap yard in the future.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:01.760]   One of the ones that I do have a lot of experience with is lead.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.100]   Lead right now is between 85 cents and $1 a pound, depending.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.100]   It depends upon the antimony content of it.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:19.220]   You can get lead in all sorts of forms, from tire weights to range lead to lead sheet scrap.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.220]   You can get lead in all sorts of forms.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.900]   But the neat thing about lead is it's really easy to melt.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.700]   It's melt temperature is 620 Fahrenheit.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.940]   And generally, you pour it around 700.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:33.020]   And you can pour it into ingots.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:40.100]   And actually, for some professional work I've done, I got some 80-pound ingots of lead.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.780]   They're not that big, and darn, are they heavy.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:48.420]   But actually, the funny thing is when you get above the 80-pound ingot, you get into
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.060]   1,000-pound blocks of lead.
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:56.460]   They're called sows, like the pig.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.820]   So it's easy to melt and pour.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.380]   And the thing about lead is it's impervious to about everything.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.060]   It just does not want to react.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:11.980]   There are lead roofs on churches in Europe and in the UK that are over 1,000 years old.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.980]   Lead was the first metal that man ever started to work with.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:24.540]   And over time, it forms a layer of lead oxide and eventually lead carbonate on the surface.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.700]   And it's basically like a scab on a wound.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.700]   It protects itself.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.220]   And the layer doesn't go very deep.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.820]   And we've actually talked about-- we got one of the people who works for the lead company
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.820]   has a big farm someplace.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.660]   And he's got like 200 acres.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:50.060]   We literally talked about the idea of just putting a million pounds of lead-- that's
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   a million dollars in money-- out in the farm field, just in a pile.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.900]   That's the storage method for it.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.260]   And it's like, it's not going to go bad.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.620]   It's not going to get bad.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.260]   It's not going to change.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:14.860]   And it is going to be very, very, very hard for someone to, one, recognize what it is,
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:19.540]   where it is, and then to get it out of there.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:22.540]   How are you going to move a million pounds of lead?
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.300]   A semi-truck carries 40,000 pounds.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:36.060]   So you're looking at 25 semi-trailer loads of lead just to move it.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:44.020]   But again, we were hypothesizing that as an inflationary proof storage method of lead.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.820]   Now we think over the next 10 to 20 years, lead is going to become more invaluable than
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:57.540]   valuable because of the rise of the lithium ion battery and the less use of the lead acid
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.540]   battery.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.820]   And we think lead use is going to actually go down rather than go up.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:08.260]   Incidentally, lead is, on a percentage basis, lead is the most recycled metal in the world.
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.180]   The most recycled metal in the world by volume is steel.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.260]   The most recycled by percentage is lead.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.540]   So we talked about actually doing that with lead.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:24.220]   You can take lead down to your scrap dealer and they will buy it all day long.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:29.500]   You're better off, scrap dealer might give you 30, 35 cents for it.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.620]   And an industry person, and I found a couple in Detroit, they're small lead foundries.
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.620]   They melt and pour lead.
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:44.340]   They will give you 70 to 85 cents for the same amount of metal.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:49.060]   And they're going to zap it with their XRF because they want to know what the antimony
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:55.260]   content is of the lead, which determines its hardness.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:01.500]   Or if it's pure lead, or what we call 3% or 6% with the antimony in there.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.460]   And then they're going to buy it from you.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:10.540]   Again, not as easy to dispose of as gold and silver, yet it is another method that is an
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:17.180]   option for you to consider based upon what you have, where you're at, what your priorities
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.660]   are and what your availabilities are.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:24.340]   I mean, if you've got a front end loader, you can load, put bars of lead into your field
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:27.700]   all day long and get them in and out easy enough.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.340]   If you don't, it's a pain in the rear end to do it by hand.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:39.380]   So again, this is information from Josh and me that you can utilize for what you have
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.580]   and what's available to you.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:46.420]   If you're in a two bedroom apartment, you're not storing ingots of lead in the closet.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:50.500]   You're going to do something that is available to you.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.380]   So lead, it was an interesting commodity.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.860]   Aluminum, we said it was too fluffy.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.540]   What else is there that you're thinking of, Josh, that we can talk about?
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:04.900]   Oh, I have, I got kerosene.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.220]   I got in the 1990s.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:15.180]   I got it for $1.35 a gallon from the gas station and I stored it because I decided kerosene
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.580]   in the 1990s was going to be my amount of fuel.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.940]   I wanted one fuel that would do the most.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.380]   I can heat with kerosene.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.740]   I can cook with kerosene.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.900]   I can illuminate with kerosene.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:31.620]   I can even do some transportation, a vehicle on kerosene, which is a longer story.
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620]   So I bought kerosene.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.660]   Well, that kerosene is now $4.50 a gallon.
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:42.820]   So from 1995 to 2020, did I have an inflationary balance or gain?
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.100]   Yeah, probably.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.100]   Yes.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:50.620]   But really it was meant for my own usage rather than for trading.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.700]   Yet it could be a good trading item.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:04.060]   But I have a saying from my 35 years in the energy field, never go long on energy, ever.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.420]   Decade by decade, average basis, energy is always cheaper.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.300]   So what do you mean, Steve?
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.860]   Gasoline used to be $0.32 when I was a kid.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.260]   That was 50 years ago.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.260]   Okay.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:23.420]   Josh, you want to do the inflationary adjustment from $0.32 on a gallon of gasoline to...
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.260]   I'll look it up, but I'm tempted.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.940]   I was like, "Oh, we could bring in some peak oil conversation."
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.740]   I bet Steve would have some quite salacious words to say considering what you're saying
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.140]   right now on that topic.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.940]   There is no such thing as peak oil.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.580]   Peak oil is bullshit made up by people who want to motivate you.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.780]   They want to motivate you by fear.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.540]   It's always the sky is falling.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.740]   I mean, literally I have books from 1910 that talk about when are we going to run out of
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.740]   coal.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:02.180]   I kid you not, 1910, 1920, we're going to run out of coal.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.540]   It's always the same thing.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.540]   We're always going to run out of something.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:06.540]   We're going to run out of air.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.860]   We're going to run out of water.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:09.220]   We're going to run out of oil.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.660]   We're going to run out of whiskey.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.580]   We're going to run out of something.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:20.260]   It's like Ron White was doing a comedy routine and he's talking about going back to his doctor
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:23.300]   in California to renew his marijuana card.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.980]   The doctor goes, "What are you taking marijuana for?"
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.380]   He goes, "Anxiety."
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.620]   He goes, "What do you get anxiety about?"
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:34.740]   He goes, "Not having any pot to smoke."
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.740]   I ran the numbers.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:43.340]   I mean, it's just a continual always thing of someone trying to motivate you by fear
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.660]   that has no experience in the field.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:46.660]   Right.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.140]   I ran the numbers for you.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:58.100]   In 1950, if I purchased an item for 35 cents, then in 2020, that same item would cost $3.77.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.140]   I mean, that's almost an exact analog for gasoline.
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.140]   You can't store gasoline that long.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.460]   That's a long conversation.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:10.540]   You can diesel and kerosene, but that's an exact analog for almost what we got.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:18.340]   In fact, right now, diesel fuel is $2.15.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.580]   I got a bunch of diesel fuel stored because actually I got it for free.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:29.780]   I had to have a big generator moved and it had 450 gallons of diesel fuel in it.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.060]   It's like, "We got to get rid of the diesel fuel."
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.700]   It's like, "I know how you can do that.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.700]   How's that?
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:40.940]   We got to pay the guy to show up with the truck and pump it and everything else."
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.420]   It's like, "I'll take it for free."
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:49.140]   I mean, so there you go.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:53.900]   I remember gasoline being 85 cents in the early '90s when I was working at Chrysler
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.660]   and I had a Geo Metro that got 55 miles to the gallon.
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:06.580]   Now we're talking about gas being $1.75 a gallon to $2 a gallon.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.820]   You do an inflationary adjustment between, "Oh, it was 89 cents when I was working at
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.620]   Chrysler in 1992."
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.940]   Do an inflationary adjustment between 85 cents and $1.73 in 2020.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:23.300]   I bet you that 89-cent gasoline was not so cheap as you think it is.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.540]   It's cheaper now than it was then.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.740]   Natural gas crashed in price.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.260]   Oil crashed in price.
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:36.740]   I mean, there's always going to be spikes, but I'm talking on a decade-by-decade average
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:44.420]   basis or a decade-moving basis, energy is always cheaper.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.260]   There's always that oil spike to $150 a gallon.
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.980]   Well, that was artificially induced reasons, et cetera, and a bunch of other things.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:57.980]   And you notice the price of gold went up because the price of gold is directly tied to the
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:03.860]   price of diesel fuel because it takes their remote mining and everything and all their
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.500]   equipment runs on diesel fuel.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.940]   So the more they pay in diesel fuel, the more the price of gold is going to be because the
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:14.300]   cost of mining has gone up.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.900]   But you can talk about that later.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:20.660]   That's a whole other paradigm of the way things work.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:26.900]   So don't ever go long energy in any form economically.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.180]   Now, there's something intelligent you can do with energy.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:36.100]   I have a friend, and he had trouble with a propane company, and he said, "Screw it."
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.540]   He went out and he bought four 1,000-gallon tanks, and he bought them used reconditioned
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:46.500]   from a reconditioned place, so basically as good as new.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:52.100]   And he has the propane company come and fill them up every year in the summer at 95 cents,
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:58.060]   and he uses it all through the winter when propane is above $2.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:03.820]   And he's made his money back on the price of the tanks in like four years.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.100]   So there's a short-term thing you can do with energy.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:10.380]   It's like I tell everyone, "Look, you're on Facebook Marketplace.
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:14.260]   Buy your air conditioners in the wintertime, and buy your heaters and your wood stoves
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.580]   in the summertime.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:19.300]   You will buy them all for bargains at each time, and so what?
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.460]   You got to wait six months, but that six months will happen.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.860]   That six months will occur."
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:31.180]   And there was a great wood stove, beautiful $1,500 wood stove with the glass in the front
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.500]   and the legs and everything.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:39.180]   And it's just premium stove like you'd get a tractor supply store for $150 on Facebook
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:44.260]   Marketplace from someone who just said, "I just want to get rid of this thing."
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:51.340]   They spent the $1,500, you spent the $150 and got it for a bargain.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:55.380]   But yeah, so you can be smart with energy and you can like your propane because propane
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.380]   never goes bad.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:01.860]   So now he's got two years, literally, more than two years of propane on his property,
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:07.300]   which in his generator runs off of propane, his stove runs off of propane, his furnace
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.380]   runs off of propane, his water heater runs off of propane.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.620]   They all run off of propane.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:19.500]   So he went monofuel with propane and he buys it cheap in the summer.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.980]   He got the tanks reconditioned used.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:28.300]   And so he's making money all day long on that aspect of propane.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.300]   I think these are good examples.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:39.140]   And I want to talk for a minute from the financial perspective about what you will, if you think
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:46.540]   about people often have significant opinions around things like gold and silver.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540]   And it's…
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.880]   There's the old word again.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.340]   People have hot feelings around gold and silver.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.060]   Some people say, "I believe in gold."
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.860]   Some people say, "I don't believe in gold."
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:02.300]   And I remember the first time I went to go and buy…
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:07.020]   I was trained as a professional financial advisor in a fairly mainstream viewpoint.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:11.140]   And I remember the first time I went and decided I was going to buy a gold coin, I felt like
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.060]   I was committing some heinous crime.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:17.900]   I felt I was looking over my shoulder going into the coin shop and I just felt like, "Wow,
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.900]   I don't know what am I doing here."
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:22.620]   And it was all a totally opaque world to me.
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.020]   I didn't understand.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.300]   And when I left, I looked at this little coin and I thought, "I spent $300.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.500]   I think I bought a 10-ounce gold eagle.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.980]   I spent $350 on that."
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.340]   And then in time, I became more comfortable with the topic of investing.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:42.860]   But what I've often identified and seen is that if you understand a marketplace, you'll
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:47.580]   see that that marketplace has distinct advantages and distinct disadvantages.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:54.260]   So as a way of example, gold and silver being commodities really should perform just about
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:16:01.300]   like copper and lead being commodities, which means that they should in time keep pace with
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.540]   inflation generally speaking.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:08.300]   Now because of the emotions that are charged with it, because of the market, so for example,
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.740]   you have arguments, you know, Stephen's talking about the lead marketplace, people using lead.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.060]   Well, there's all these arguments about the silver and the silver, you know, people using
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.060]   up silver in the industrial system.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.660]   There's arguments about gold.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.180]   Gold is extremely-
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:24.540]   I hate that on TV.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.060]   It's like, "Silver, we can't make silver.
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.700]   We can't make solar panels without silver.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.140]   Silver is going to go up.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.260]   Alternative energy, your cell phone uses silver.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:40.820]   Now silver is advertised as being antiviral and antimicrobial and we're in a pandemic
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:49.660]   and buy silver and I'm screaming at the TV, 'Shut the F up!'"
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:52.780]   I hope that your blood pressure is okay, Stephen.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.420]   Either that or you're going to turn off the TV.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.420]   Oh, no.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.420]   No, no, no.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:03.900]   You know, Jack Spierker always said that, you know, Harris should go on medical marijuana.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.140]   No, no, no.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.140]   No, no.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:14.580]   It's just, you know, I have passion and enthusiasm for what I talk about and I speak about it
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:19.780]   in a passion-enthusiastic method because a lot of the stuff I'm dealing with is life
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.540]   and death, okay?
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:26.980]   When I'm teaching different elements of the military, special forces, I'm teaching different
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:27.980]   things about batteries.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:32.700]   Look, if their battery dies and they can't make that call and they can't get their evac,
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.100]   they're captured or they're dead.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:39.420]   When I'm talking to you about preparedness and about food storage and food making and
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:45.260]   different tools and everything else, you know, if you go, "Oh, Steve, I thought you said
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.420]   blah, blah, blah."
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:50.460]   No one ever says, "Steve, what did you really—what do you really think?
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.740]   What did you really mean?"
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:52.820]   No one ever says that.
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:57.580]   I come across clear as a bell because your life depends upon it.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:03.020]   It's like, "Oh, I thought you—I got, you know, you wanted me to buy bleach.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.580]   Oh, well, I bought ammonia.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.380]   Won't that purify my water?"
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.380]   No.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:13.980]   You know, I'm talking about life and death subjects here, that, you know, literally your
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:22.620]   life could be dependent upon what I say based upon a situation that gets thrust upon you
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:23.620]   in the future.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:28.620]   There's an old saying that says, "Leadership has never found one or acquired.
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:33.780]   It is always suddenly and violently thrust upon you throughout history."
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:36.300]   George Bush, 9/11, good story.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.300]   He was elected president.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.220]   He was the president of the United States.
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.580]   You think of him as a leader.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.420]   No, he was never a leader until 9/11 happened and leadership was suddenly and violently
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.100]   thrust upon him.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:52.860]   No matter what your feelings or stories are about 9/11, I'm using that as an example of
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.820]   how leadership is suddenly and violently thrust upon you.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.620]   Well, you can be in a situation—it could be the pandemic, it could be a hurricane,
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:04.020]   it could be an earthquake, it could be a blizzard, you weren't monitoring the weather, and all
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.580]   of a sudden it's suddenly and violently thrust upon you, and you're going to fall back on
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:14.180]   your lowest level of training, and your lowest level of training is Harris yelling at you
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.020]   because you don't forget it.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:26.780]   And that's why I am extremely verbose, communicative, boisterous, loud, straightforward, blunt,
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:32.100]   you know, and to the point on things when it comes to preparedness because, you know,
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.660]   this is a life and death subject.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:39.700]   I mean, you're talking about stuff with—in radical personal finance that dramatically
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:45.180]   affects the quality of a person's life now and in the future, okay?
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.580]   It's not really life and death.
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.820]   It could be when it comes to, like, using money for, like, medical treatment and everything
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.420]   else and stuff like that.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.780]   It could be life and death, but you're talking about stuff that affects more of a lifestyle,
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:04.900]   and I'm talking more of things that go along with what you're teaching.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:09.100]   You know, we're being smart financially.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:15.140]   You should be smart with food and water and power and self-reliance and independence.
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:19.780]   You know, financial independence, food independence, water independence, energy independence, those
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.300]   are all just different types of independence.
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:28.100]   But when that event happens, when it is thrust upon you and you go, "Holy crap!
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.020]   How did that happen?"
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:37.820]   I'm talking about something that, you know, very well might mean life or death to you.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:44.300]   Literally, if you don't take my advice or you didn't have my counsel, you might end
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.180]   up being dead.
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.180]   This could be everything.
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.140]   It's like I carry a tourniquet.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.300]   I carry a RATS tourniquet everywhere I go.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:57.060]   I have for, like, the last six years, ever since I had a T-TRIP-C class, which stands
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:03.340]   for Tactical Combat Casualty Care, which teaches you how to use tourniquets, and they use live
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.340]   animals.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:05.340]   They're anesthetized.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.820]   There's a vet there and everything else.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.220]   And sometimes it's called the goat lab.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.260]   Sometimes they're pigs.
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.460]   Sometimes they're different things.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:17.300]   But they're given in certain places around the world, and you learn a lot very quickly.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:24.100]   I mean, I have stopped three pumping arteries from a six-inch long, four-inch deep wound
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.500]   into the flesh of an animal.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.700]   I have stopped the bleeding within 20 seconds.
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:34.260]   That is a very, very, very powerful thing to learn, especially when you go out on the
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.940]   battlefield as a warfighter, which I have never had.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:43.420]   But the people I was working for, they're all SEAL Team guys, and they're all about
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.420]   cross-training.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:50.780]   And I came into the environment of teaching battery and power and energy because you used
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:54.580]   to only have to have bullets and water to complete your mission.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.700]   Now you need bullets, water, and batteries to complete your mission because you got to
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:04.620]   take a soft lamp, put a laser marker on the top of the hill, call up to the orbital cafe
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:10.660]   above you, and have them pickle a 2,000-pound JDAM that goes right onto that spot that you're
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.660]   looking at.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:18.860]   Well, that requires batteries, both for the Special Operations Forces laser acquisition
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:24.340]   marking device, the soft lamp, and for your radio to talk to the satellite, to the bird
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:33.580]   or to the bombers of whatever type, from F-18 to B-1 to B-52s, the B-2s above you, to drop
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:36.140]   that bomb and hit it onto the target.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.780]   If you don't have batteries, you can't complete your mission.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:42.380]   So the military got serious about batteries and power, and all the next thing I knew,
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.180]   I was roped in.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.820]   And the team guys are going, "Hey, you been in the military?"
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.820]   "Nope."
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:49.820]   "You ever done this?"
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.820]   "Nope."
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:51.820]   "Ever done that?"
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.820]   "Nope."
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:53.820]   "Nope."
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.580]   And he's yelling, "Hey, Gunny, throw the frickin' engineer in the class with the guys."
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.780]   It's like, "Where am I going?"
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.340]   He's like, "You're going to the machine gun class."
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.340]   I go, "What?"
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:13.020]   He's like, "Yeah, there's a five-day machine gun course on the .50 cal and on the M60."
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:22.780]   And I was with a bunch of Marines and other people, and I got to take a part and put it
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:29.900]   together and shoot thousands and thousands of rounds of .50 cal and .30 cal out of a
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:30.900]   M60 machine gun.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:34.740]   And it's like, I like this cross-training.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:41.660]   They just did it so I would have more familiarity with what my students had to do.
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:46.060]   And so that's how I got into the T-Trip-C class.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:54.380]   We were teaching a government law enforcement group, and they were deploying to Iraq.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.420]   And it looked at me, it's like, "You got three days?"
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:58.420]   I go, "Yep."
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.540]   I got thrown into the T-Trip-C class.
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:04.100]   But anyways, so I forgot.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:09.540]   Ever since then, I carry a tourniquet because, one, if you're a concealed carry holder, you're
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.420]   more likely to use your tourniquet on someone else than you are to use your firearm.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:20.900]   You're more likely to be near a shooting, around a shooting, not there at the time of
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.260]   the shooting to engage the bad guy with your firearm.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.340]   You might be there at the aftermath.
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:31.820]   Then I was in law enforcement for five years, and I always carried a tourniquet because
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.820]   I can get shot.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.620]   My vest only covers a certain area.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:42.800]   And so I actually might have to self-administer a tourniquet to myself.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.980]   We just had two cops shot, sheriff deputies shot in San Diego.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.260]   And she actually, the guy had a head wound.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:54.780]   It was a strike across the forehead, not into the cranium.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:01.460]   And she was shot in the jaw, and she could barely call in Officer Down, which was a 998
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:04.620]   code in Los Angeles.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:09.100]   She could barely say 998 into the radio to get the calvary coming to her.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:14.660]   But she actually used her tourniquet as a pressure dressing to stop the bleeding on
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:15.660]   the guy's head wound.
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:19.660]   There's a joke about using a tourniquet around someone's neck to stop the bleeding, and it
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.020]   solves the problem.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.900]   You don't use tourniquets around the neck.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.980]   Use tourniquets on extremities.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.640]   But in this case, it's actually a perfect use for a tourniquet.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:36.140]   She had something to stop the bleeding, which could be a T-shirt, a rag, a paper towel,
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:41.220]   a Curlax, sanitary gauze, could be anything.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:47.340]   She put that onto his head laceration, and head lacs bleed like sons of bitches.
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:53.220]   Smalls head wound looks like it's a bullet strike, blood falling in your eyes and everything.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:59.780]   So anyways, he had a bad head wound, and she put a compress on it, and then she used her
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.960]   tourniquet, which you can pull tight on it.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.260]   She just pulled it tight around the top of his head to put pressure on the bandage to
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:17.020]   hold it against his head because she may have been using her pistol, the radio, or applying
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.660]   first aid to herself.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:28.900]   So if those people who taught me, and they're very distinctive in the way they teach as
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:34.160]   well, it's a little bit less than a drill sergeant, but a lot more than your college
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.080]   professor in terms of intensity.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.240]   Because if they failed to teach me how to use that tourniquet, and it was not permanently
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.320]   in my mind, in my muscle memory, the lowest level of training that I'm going to fall back
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:55.480]   into when I'm shot, when I'm bleeding, when I'm in pain, when I'm cold, and I'm hurting.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:01.360]   In moments of stress like that, you will forget your mother's own name, literally, let alone
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.680]   their phone number.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:11.000]   If you cannot repeat that exercise under stress, then you may very well die because you have
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   failed to put that tourniquet onto your leg, and your femoral artery was hit, and you'll
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.300]   bleed out and die within three minutes.
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:27.120]   So that's the level of seriousness, life and death seriousness that I've been taught with
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.500]   since 2004.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:37.460]   And so by reputation and nature, and by stealing the best practices that I've been taught with
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:44.620]   in teaching, I have naturally adopted that into my preparedness teaching, because I believe
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.180]   it's a life and death subject.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.100]   I believe it's deadly serious.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:49.420]   I get myself in trouble.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.620]   10% of the people out there hate me.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:52.620]   Oh, they loathe me.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:55.300]   They'd walk a mile to piss on me if I fell down.
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:28:00.620]   The other 90% are rabid followers of Harris.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.380]   They want to hear what I have to say.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.220]   They want to hear what I'm talking about.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:05.980]   They want to ask me questions.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:11.460]   And they take what I'm telling them as dead ass serious that they then utilize.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:16.900]   And like I said, take what I say and apply it to yourself.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.460]   Maybe you only have-- maybe you're missing an arm.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:22.340]   It might be a little hard for you to use a tourniquet.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:25.380]   You might have to do one arm.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.380]   I don't know.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:29.700]   That's a poor example.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:34.180]   When people actually try-- when someone's trying to do preparedness, and they say, oh,
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.180]   that's stupid.
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.180]   You shouldn't do that.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.180]   Oh, why do you want to do that?
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.180]   You're a survivalist.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.180]   That's crazy.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:44.660]   Why would you ever-- someone's trying to protect their family with preparedness-- food, water,
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.020]   energy, medical, everything else.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.900]   And someone else is trying to talk them out of it.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:54.580]   I am rabidly aggressive against that idiot trying to talk him out of it.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:29:04.100]   In fact, I personally consider it attempted involuntary manslaughter.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.860]   There's no question that it definitely matters.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:08.860]   And I agree with you.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:15.500]   It's funny that it-- I-- Beat me up, Josh.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500]   Come on.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.500]   No, no, no.
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500]   I don't disagree with you.
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.700]   I just-- obviously, it's sobering words when you just say that.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.860]   Obviously, it's why it takes a moment to think about whether that's true.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:31.780]   But certainly, I think that preparing for-- protecting and providing for yourself and
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:36.300]   for those that you love is a primary responsibility that we all have.
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:41.740]   And anything that we do that diminishes that can have very significant and dire consequences,
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.420]   as you say.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:47.440]   And I never want to be in the situation where I look back on the other side of a tragedy
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:53.820]   and say, "Well, I could have done more and I was just too dumb or too lazy to do more."
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:57.420]   Rather, if I look back from the other side of a tragedy and say, "I did everything I
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:58.420]   could," fine.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.420]   We'll deal with the results.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:07.300]   But we owe it to ourselves and to those we love to do everything that we can.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:11.780]   Let me talk for a moment-- big picture-- about comparing these commodities.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.580]   And we'll close with a few final examples.
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.340]   But what you see when we talk about these commodities is-- I was thinking about the
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:20.340]   tourniquet.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:24.820]   A tourniquet is an extraordinarily valuable thing at a certain time.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:29.280]   And it shows how-- it's cheap and easy to find a tourniquet.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.780]   It's not that hard-- 20 bucks for a decent one and it's probably shipped to your door.
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:35.300]   It's not that hard to come across a tourniquet.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.500]   But when you need one, its value is inestimable.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:43.780]   When you're actually in a situation where there's blood pumping out of an extremity
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:47.900]   and you need to apply a tourniquet, it's invaluable.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.660]   And I think that that's often how it is with many physical items.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:58.020]   That physical items, for the most part, are generally in abundant supply for most of us.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.660]   Most of us don't worry about is there going to be food at the grocery store.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:04.940]   Most of us don't worry about is there water going to come out of my tap.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:08.260]   Most of us don't worry about these things.
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:11.400]   But what happens is markets change.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.940]   And when markets change, then all of a sudden those things can dry up.
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.900]   The power can go out to your house for--
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:18.900]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.980]   I got one more for you, Josh.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.100]   We got to cover this one more item I forgot.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:24.620]   You just triggered me onto it.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620]   Hang on.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620]   Hang on.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.620]   Bullets.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620]   That was going to be on my list because that was going to be a shortage I was going to
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620]   talk about.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.620]   So hang on.
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.260]   Let me finish my commentary and then we'll go to things like that.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:40.980]   So when you look at things that are-- so all of a sudden what you're used to having can
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.060]   disappear.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:46.220]   And when it disappears, its value increases enormously.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:51.620]   And so the question is, are you prepared to provide for somebody when they're in that
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.300]   time of need?
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:58.380]   In general, a six pack of beer costs six bucks-ish.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.500]   But when there's a hurricane and you're trying to get somebody who's a crew working across
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.900]   the street at the end of the day, you've got one tree that's down in your yard and you've
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.940]   got a crew across the street that's working.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.620]   If you can walk over and you can say, "Hey guys, listen, I got a cold six pack or a cold
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:14.620]   12 pack of beer.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.380]   Would you be willing to come over and just real quick cut down this one tree for me?"
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:21.060]   That's something that you would be charged a couple hundred dollars for.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:26.360]   But in the right set of circumstances, that cold six pack of beer buys you the world.
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:30.240]   And almost all of these items that we talk about have those characteristics.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:34.160]   Now when we put this into financial planning, that's where things become difficult because
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.860]   I like that we talked about gasoline and how the gasoline hasn't really grown that much.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:44.420]   And when we talked about if you store a million dollars worth of lead in a field, we're not
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.200]   saying, "Oh, it's going to become worth $10 billion."
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.400]   It's just going to be a million dollars plus whatever generally the rate of inflation is.
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:57.040]   And so that shows the downsides and the upsides of stockpiling things.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.780]   When you stockpile physical goods, you have certain inherent benefits.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:04.600]   You have big benefits such as, "Hey, this is available.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.560]   Hey, this can't be manipulated by currency fluctuations.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.160]   Hey, I'll have this if the whole financial system falls apart.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:16.040]   I'll have this if a corrupt dictator goes into power and destroys the economy or there's
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   a global pandemic.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.560]   I'll have this."
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.720]   But there is a downside.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:24.920]   The downside is, "I'll have this, but it's probably not going to be worth all that much
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.520]   more except by the rate of inflation probably."
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.920]   And so we accept that.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.000]   So when you think about gold investing, and people talk about how Warren Buffett says,
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.600]   "All the gold in the world wouldn't fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool and I'm not investing
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.600]   in gold."
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.480]   Well, he's right because if you compare investing in gold, which can't really grow by all that
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.600]   much because it's just sitting there, and you compare that to investing in something
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:55.120]   that may be able to grow at 6%, 8%, 10%, 20%, 200% per year, well, you'd be a fool to put
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.580]   all your money in gold.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:34:03.520]   On the other hand, the fact that gold just sits there has a huge value to a lot of people
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.080]   in a lot of circumstances.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:10.720]   And so when financial markets collapse, when companies go bankrupt, when you need the ability
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:15.280]   to get money and transport money to other places, then all of a sudden that gold is
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.280]   really valuable.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:20.440]   And what I love talking about some of these commodities is it even helps you to see why
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:24.360]   are things like precious metals, which we're not discussing in today's show, why are they
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360]   so valuable?
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.320]   So let's talk about, you know, Stephen's million pounds of lead example.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.320]   Right.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.320]   Go ahead.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.080]   Let me back you up for a second.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:40.120]   But if you live in a two-bedroom condo, okay, and you have no space and you have nothing
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:45.360]   else you can do, and you need to park some of your money for inflationary purposes, you
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:51.320]   can put a quarter million dollars worth of gold into a safety deposit box and be reasonably
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.400]   assured that it's safe.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.920]   It's not going to be stolen.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:01.720]   The cost of the box versus the cost of the gold is very low and that you have an inflationary
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.720]   proof head.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.920]   Now, if you ever bought $40,000 in gold and $40,000 in silver, you find yourself saying,
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:12.560]   "Oh my God, where am I going to put all this damn silver?"
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   Right.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:17.280]   You know, so the density of gold is the good thing and I'll let you go on to the lead,
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.320]   but when has anyone other than Josh Sheets and Radical Personal Finance ever talked to
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.120]   you about a commodity you could put in a field for 20 years?
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.120]   Exactly.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.440]   So let's, like, the lead is a good example.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.920]   So if you think about, if I'm going to buy $800,000 worth of lead, I'm going to put 800-
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920]   And guess what?
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.920]   Guess what?
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:42.600]   I can actually, right now, Josh, I can actually have you call a place.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.080]   And one of the places is called Dole Run.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.360]   I can actually have you call Dole Run.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.000]   You can wire them $800,000.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.100]   They will send you 20 semi-trucks full of lead.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.100]   No joke.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.100]   Right.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.100]   This week.
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.100]   Right.
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:58.400]   I mean, that's actually, I mean, can you do that with gold?
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.400]   Can you do that with silver?
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.800]   Not at your local pawn shop.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.800]   Delivered on a truck.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.800]   Right.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.640]   So, delivered on a truck this week.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.680]   It's like, fine, guys, pull it.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.680]   I got the forklift.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:11.680]   Pull it up to the barn.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:13.480]   We're going to put the lead in the barn.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.480]   Go ahead.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.480]   Right.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:23.040]   So, to finish this example out, if you compare lead to gold, you want to invest $800,000
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.040]   in lead.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.480]   You can wire $800,000 to the company.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.320]   They'll send 20 semi-trucks.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.360]   You can dump the lead in the corner of the barn.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.680]   You can dump the lead in the field.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:35.920]   On the other hand, you can, if you can get your hands on one, you can purchase one, the
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:41.080]   standard good delivery bar, the 400-ounce bar of gold that you see pictured in a movie
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.820]   when you see a stack of gold.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.800]   That's the basic commodity of gold.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.120]   There's no seniorage expenses.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   It's just gold.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.120]   It's a bar of gold.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.420]   Well, in today's world, that has a market value of something like $800,000.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.360]   But that 400-ounce bar is about 27 pounds.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.360]   Right.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.340]   So, you could take that 27-pound bar.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:05.480]   You can stick that into a backpack on your back, and you will walk around with $800,000
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.440]   of physical money or something that can be turned into money in any corner of the country
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.640]   or the world.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:17.720]   On the one hand, it's untold more valuable than the lead because of its portability.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.480]   On the other hand, you can look at that portability, and you could say, "Anybody in the world can
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.640]   put a gun in my ribs and can say, 'Give me your backpack,' and now I've lost that,"
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.140]   whereas somebody is going to have to work really hard for them to come and get the million
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:34.360]   dollars, the $800,000 of lead that's stacked out in the back 40.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.360]   So any—
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:42.400]   And that's why I want people to take what you and I are saying and make it their own
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.560]   and utilize it for their own personal situations.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.040]   I'm not telling you what to do.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.240]   We're just giving you examples.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.720]   Modify as you so desire.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:52.720]   Right.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:59.160]   So, any physical item has certain benefits, certain characteristics, and those—sorry—any
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:03.080]   physical item has certain characteristics, inherent attributes.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.240]   And in one circumstance, they can be benefits.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.960]   In another circumstance, they can be drawbacks.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:15.200]   And so portability is an inherent attribute, but it's either a benefit or a disadvantage
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.360]   based upon your perspective.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:24.480]   And that's the mindset that many people have—that do not have about all kinds of investments,
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:31.880]   be it gold bars, gold coins, boxes of ammunition, boxes of stock certificates, mutual funds,
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.880]   insurance policies.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:37.400]   These things have attributes, and it's these attributes that when you understand them,
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:42.680]   you can see how in some circumstances, these attributes are positive and they're benefits
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.680]   for you.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.400]   In other circumstances, these inherent attributes are negative and they're drawbacks.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.520]   So what I want to do is list out a few more things.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.880]   We talked about some interesting things.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.080]   We started with salt and sugar and honey.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.080]   These are valuable—
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.080]   And ethanol.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.080]   And ethanol.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.880]   These are valuable for you and your family, but you're not going to put a million dollars
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.880]   in salt, right?
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:04.880]   You're never going to do that.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.600]   You're not going to put a thousand dollars in salt.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.200]   But yet, these things are very valuable.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.660]   And so you can see that these attributes are useful, but they have a limit.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:16.120]   Now you move on to something like—
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120]   But—
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   Go ahead.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.400]   But you could put $5,000 in honey.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.400]   Right.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:22.400]   You could, certainly.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.960]   Maybe not $10,000, but if you had a barn and stuff, you could put $5,000 in.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.160]   That's a pretty powerful statement.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.160]   Sure.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.160]   Sure.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:37.440]   And if you think about it right, what I hope to do in today's show is to get people to
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.560]   appreciate physical assets.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:46.400]   Now I'm a globe-trotting, suitcase-towing person, and so physical attributes, physical
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.600]   things for me are very difficult because I'm moving around and I'm changing things all
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.600]   around.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.200]   So physicality, which is an attribute, is now for me something that's difficult.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.440]   I still have physical assets, but I have to engage—I have to think more creatively about
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.080]   the storage and the maintenance, and they become difficult.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.920]   But for somebody who has physical space, somebody has a house, somebody has a garage out back,
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.280]   somebody has a barn, all of a sudden now these physical assets are important.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:17.440]   And physical assets have the attribute of being less affected and/or unaffected by the
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:20.400]   vagaries of the stuff that happens on TV.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.240]   So if you've got a pallet of honey out in your back shop, when you walk out there you're
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.400]   going to see the pallet of honey.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.840]   And something like that, it would be an unusual thief who comes and says, "I'm going to take
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.240]   this pallet of honey."
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:36.160]   And so physical things are very, very useful.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.320]   And so then you could take it.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.480]   And so, you know, you were talking about bullets.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.720]   Almost any physical thing has benefits—or sorry, has attributes that can be advantageous.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.680]   So in the past when I've talked about commodities, certainly—we haven't talked about salt and
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.640]   sugar and honey—but those are genuine commodities that are useful.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.640]   But usually you think of metals.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.140]   We've talked about different approaches of metals.
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:02.480]   But then things like bullets, it's a commodity.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.680]   I've talked about storing commodities such as AR-15 lowers.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.800]   Well, if you had done that when I talked about it three or four years ago and you'd bought
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:14.740]   a box of 10 or 20 lowers, and then maybe you were cooped up in your home during the lockdowns
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:22.240]   for the pandemic, and you went ahead and built 10 lowers into genuine rifles and sold those,
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.400]   now you've got genuinely a high profit return with a basic commodity, an AR-15 lower.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.620]   Bullets have their own markets.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:35.600]   My experience, guns around the world are not that difficult to find, even in places and
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:39.000]   in countries where they are not legal.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.680]   So people are always worried about laws.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.420]   My experience traveling is that I think I could come up with a gun in just about any
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.700]   country in the world if you give me at least a few days.
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:50.140]   But what's hard to come up with is bullets.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:53.340]   Bullets on the other hand can be very, very difficult.
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:57.620]   And so stockpiling those can be very useful.
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:02.740]   Right now, if you had just, a couple years ago, you just systematically gone to the gun
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:08.460]   shop once a week and purchased 1,000 rounds of 9mm, you could easily flip those boxes
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:14.500]   of 1,000 rounds of 9mm ball ammo on Craigslist for a significant healthy profit if you had
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.900]   stocked up when they were a bargain.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.260]   Actually, ammo is not allowed on Craigslist, but people do do ammo.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:29.860]   I mean, there's ways around it, but 9mm right now is going for 80 cents to a dollar a round
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.260]   in the United States right now.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.260]   That is stunning.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.260]   If you can find it.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:34.260]   Yeah, that's stunning.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:37.260]   And you can't find it in any decent quality, in any decent quantities at this point in
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:40.540]   time in retail gun shops anyway, right?
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:41.540]   That's right.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:46.700]   Now, I actually have a friend of mine who is a weapons professional and he has, through
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:54.660]   his career, he has made money through a lot of hard work and a lot of talent and perseverance.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:43:02.460]   And he has a large space and he actually has a semi-trailer sitting on his property and
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:07.620]   it's innocuous, secured in more ways than you would imagine.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:14.360]   And he will literally spend half a million, three quarters of a million dollars on ammunition
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.400]   over a short period of time.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:22.980]   It's like two years ago, you know, after Trump was in office, we're going ammunition is just
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.980]   way too cheap.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.740]   Everything is just way, guns are cheap, ammo is cheap.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:34.220]   And he did this pre-Obama, post-Obama, pre-Trump, post-Trump.
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:42.900]   And he literally had like 30 million rounds of 22 and 223 and nine millimeter, all in
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:46.340]   multiple, one or two semi-trailers.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:56.140]   And when Obama ran the prices up, and Obama was the best gun salesman in the entire world.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:44:02.020]   So when the prices went up during Obama, he sold all of his, most of his ammunition that
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:06.340]   he had for sale, he's got his own, he's got his ammo for sale.
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:11.020]   He sold it at two to four times what he paid for it.
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:16.700]   And then he took that money and he waited and Trump was elected and everything got so
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.700]   cheap.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:22.060]   I mean, we're talking like, you know, 12 cents a round for nine millimeter or something like
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.060]   that.
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:28.980]   And he bought another couple of semi-trailer loads full of ammunition and he's been selling
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:33.780]   it all during pandemic, the riots, and now the upcoming elections.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:42.820]   And so, you know, he's making 50%, a hundred percent, 200%, 300% on his money.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:47.940]   And yeah, it takes five, six, eight years to do it, but you know what, where can you
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:50.260]   get bank interest like that?
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:57.900]   - Right, and sometimes those kinds of markets are clearer to people, especially someone
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.660]   like that who's involved in the business, your knowledge of the market.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:04.300]   - He's an industry professional, most definitely.
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:07.780]   - And so what I think many people should do, I mean, I used to know electricians, right?
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.100]   Electricians, they keep wire and they know the market and they just stockpile it in the
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.460]   back of their shed or whatever copper scrap they come across.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:16.500]   And then when the price gets high, they go and sell it because they understand, hey,
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.900]   the price is back up now.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.080]   This is common.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:24.020]   And so what I think we should do when it comes to physical items, there's lots of things
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.300]   that have their benefits and sorry, have their attributes.
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.740]   And again, those attributes can be an advantage or a disadvantage.
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:38.740]   So that the attributes, if you have a decent pistol or if you have a decent AR-15, that's
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:41.500]   a very, very compact form of wealth.
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:47.420]   That's always going to be very, very desirable and will never lose its desirability.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:52.660]   And just like a gold coin, it can be put someplace and it doesn't talk, it doesn't have any registration
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:57.980]   associated with it, it doesn't send out digital signals that the IRS collects, it just sits
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:58.980]   there, right?
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:45:59.980]   It doesn't have that.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:02.780]   But on the other hand, it's very hard to take that thing across the border.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:07.020]   It's very hard to put it in your back pocket and walk onto an airplane, very, very difficult.
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:08.020]   And so on the other hand-
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.020]   - The gold, gold coins.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.780]   - No, I'm talking about the gun.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.780]   The gun doesn't work very well.
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:12.780]   On the other hand-
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:13.780]   - Oh yeah, the gun, yeah.
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:15.180]   - The gold coin can.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:21.780]   And so now if you'll capture this way of thinking and you'll say, "I see the benefits of these
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:26.620]   things that I may not previously have seen," you can now come back to your life and you
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.340]   can say, "What makes sense for me?"
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:31.620]   And for somebody it makes sense that for the first time in your life you buy a five gallon
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:33.980]   bucket of honey and you'll never sell it, right?
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:37.180]   What you'll do is over the next three or four or five years, you'll use it, you'll put it
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:41.300]   in your bread, you'll put it on your pancakes or whatever you do and you're like, "Hey,
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300]   I saved some money."
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:46.700]   And that's the thing about physical things is that you can buy them when they're on sale.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.580]   And so when you move into bulk buying, which is often what you do when you move into when
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:53.820]   you're stockpiling things, you'll save money.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.020]   And if you buy things for your use and you develop a diversified portfolio of physical
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.940]   items, then at any point in time you can go and you can say, "Okay, this thing I'm gonna
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:06.900]   sell over here and I can access this market over there.
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:08.660]   So I need to make a mortgage payment.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.980]   I need a thousand bucks.
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:13.180]   What I'll go ahead and do is I've got a thousand bucks worth of stainless steel.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:17.020]   I'll go ahead and flip this on Craigslist or on Facebook marketplace right now or I'll
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:19.780]   take it to the machine shop and I'll see if they'll buy a thousand dollars worth of my
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.820]   steel."
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:24.620]   And you go and you liquidate something and you move it and you solve your problem.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:29.540]   The last thing I wanna point out, which is something that I'm intensely conscious of
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:35.900]   is how advantageous physical items are from a financial planning perspective because they're
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.400]   unusual.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.180]   And so imagine a guy who's just a general trades guy and he's purchased some physical
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.180]   items.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:45.180]   He's got some cash saved.
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:50.260]   He's got some money in his 401k, but for whatever reason, something went wrong and now he's
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.160]   headed for bankruptcy court.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:57.020]   Do you really think that the bankruptcy judge is gonna come out to his house and say, "Hey
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:00.660]   buddy, listen, I see those five things of stainless steel over there.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:03.140]   Those are worth $600.
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:04.600]   Those need to be on your statement.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.140]   And over here I see you've got two buckets of honey.
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:10.100]   And that's worth $400 and that's gotta be written down.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:15.260]   And I see over here that you bought a chest of tools, of machinist's tools on Craigslist
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:18.860]   when some guy just had to move or mechanics tools, he had to move.
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:21.820]   And so you stocked up on these tools and by the way, those gotta be there."
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.500]   That's just not the world we live in.
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:29.540]   And so even in a financial situation, having physical assets that can be bought and sold
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:35.540]   easily without paper trails, that can be stored easily, that can be strewn around can allow
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:40.940]   you to generate significant levels of wealth that protect you.
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.700]   And you can walk into bankruptcy court and come out the other side with your buckets
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:44.700]   of honey.
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.180]   And you've still covered your honey supply.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:53.680]   And so that's one area where these physical items have a tremendous value.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.580]   And now when you mingle that with a mixture of a knowledge of financial planning laws
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.980]   and the value of having money in a 401k and the value of cryptocurrency and the value
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:08.500]   of this and that and the other, now you can build a very, very robust financial life that
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:12.300]   sees you through almost any kind of imaginable situation.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:21.420]   And I want to comment on that because I think the financial, I'll back up a couple of things.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:25.620]   One, there's an old saying that is the counterpoint to what you just said.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:27.740]   And again, I'm not criticizing what you said.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:32.540]   I'm just putting the counterpoint for other people out there to consider as they're listening
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:38.060]   to you and I and developing their own personal strategy is there's a saying that's very true.
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.300]   You don't own your things.
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.780]   Your things own you.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:47.780]   And so having a lot of things can be a detriment and it can be an asset to just what you said.
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:51.740]   And in some of the cases, what you're talking about with the buckets of honey, it's a metaphor
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:59.700]   for whatever that item or that vehicle is that you want, which is a very good one if
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.860]   you're facing bankruptcy.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:07.940]   But the amount of personal, I think the wealth, the sound financial strategy you're teaching
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.980]   some people, there's some teenagers listening to you, you know that.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:14.700]   And there's some people who are like 80 years old going, "Damn, I wish I knew that when
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:16.300]   I was 18."
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:23.180]   And there's people in their 20s and 30s and me in my 50s and you're helping us build our
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:25.900]   platform for our railroad.
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:32.380]   I mean, you're helping people cut down, map out, cut down the trees, then you got to build
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:37.060]   up the railroad bed, then you got to put gravel down, then you put down the ties, then you
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.780]   put down the rails and now your train can run on it.
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:45.860]   And the financial basis and the financial education you are giving people is what is
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:49.500]   enabling them for their train to go down the tracks.
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:53.220]   And if you don't have that, you can't drive your car down the road, your train can't go
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:58.860]   down the tracks, you can't walk down the trail, you're immovable.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:03.860]   And the financial freedom and security you are teaching people is letting them walk down
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:08.340]   that trail, drive the car down the road and their train down the tracks and fly their
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:12.620]   airplane through the air, all of which are metaphors.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:17.460]   And that allows people to have the freedoms, like the old saying, you know, what's the
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:20.820]   hardest thing to make in your financial future?
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:25.980]   And the answer is the first million dollars, the rest comes easy.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:32.020]   And I got a good story for you of where your personal teachings have personally benefited
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:35.220]   a really good friend of mine.
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:39.780]   He's what I call a classically repressed genius.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:44.700]   He didn't go to college, he didn't get PhDs and everything else, you know, but society,
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:50.380]   there's a war against smart people out there by the normies and by society to repress genius
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:54.740]   and to repress intelligence, which is a whole nother lecture.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:52:00.460]   So anyways, he's a part owner of a company, it's mostly a blue collar job.
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:05.100]   The guy can basically fix anything, understands anything, learns anything quickly.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:12.940]   And I saw this and when the pandemic started, I said, "Hey, Sean, there's a shortage of
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:13.940]   freezers out there.
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.540]   You can't buy freezers, they're gone in the United States.
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:19.420]   You can't get them in the store, you can't buy them online.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.780]   When they are used online, they're very expensive.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:28.460]   I mean, your $170 freezer is $350 to $600."
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:34.620]   Well people would just put freezers up for sale on Facebook and it's like, "Oh, $100
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:35.780]   freezer, don't need it, come get it."
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:39.940]   Well, he'd come get it, turn around and sell it for $300 to $400.
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:45.900]   And then he taught himself appliance HVAC, how to fix freezers and refrigerators.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:51.660]   He went online to a YouTube HVAC university, taught himself HVAC.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:57.620]   He bought all of his tools used, the really good ones off of Facebook and Craigslist.
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.100]   So he didn't pay the high dollar for them.
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:04.620]   He recovers his refrigerant from people down the street that need to have the refrigerant
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:09.260]   recovered out of the appliances that they have to scrap before they can scrap them.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:13.100]   So he's picking up the refrigerant for basically free.
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:21.460]   Now he's going out and he's getting freezers, chest freezers and upright freezers, not refrigerators,
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:22.860]   freezers.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.500]   And he's fixing them.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.580]   Sometimes it's a starting capacitor.
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:28.040]   Sometimes it's a starter.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:31.340]   Sometimes it's a new compressor, rarely is a new compressor.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:34.660]   Sometimes it's find a leak and suck down and recharge the thing.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:38.580]   So he's paying people 50 bucks to haul it away.
[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:44.540]   Or they're saying haul the way doesn't work and he has a tall van and he's got, he bought
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:51.620]   a really nice appliance dolly so he can move anything himself upstairs as one person, even
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:54.860]   a heavy freezer.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:54:01.260]   And he takes them home, fixes them sometimes in five minutes, sometimes in like five hours,
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:08.060]   lets them run for two weeks, puts them up on Facebook and sells them for 300 to a thousand
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:10.420]   dollars each depending.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:16.580]   And he says, Oh three, you know, 90 day warranty guaranteed to work and you know, delivery
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:19.940]   available and people love that delivery available.
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:24.580]   So anyways, he calls me up and he goes, Steve, I averaged out everything I was doing.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:25.580]   And I go, yeah.
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:33.620]   He goes, I'm making $750 a week on the side above his job of, you know, he's a part business
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.380]   owner above his job and his salary.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.260]   And he goes, this is stupid money.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.820]   I go, yeah, it's only going to last so long.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:42.980]   You need to reinvest it.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:45.340]   And we got other things for you to do.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:47.720]   And we do, but that's another story.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.740]   So anyways, you're going to love this.
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:55.500]   I taught him about the coin inflation website, which I'm sure you know.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:00.420]   And I taught him about gold and silver and buying silver on Craig's list and what he
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:04.900]   wants in silver, which is, you know, basically, I mean, starting out, you want junk silver
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:10.580]   or silver Eagles, and those are two most recognized forms of silver in the United States.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.940]   And but silver Eagles are going for $10 over spot.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:19.420]   And he found people on Craig's list that were selling, you like war, nickels, Kennedy, half
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:22.980]   dollars and a regular junk silver.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:27.260]   And they were just wanting spots or very close to spot.
[01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:29.700]   And he started buying silver at 17.
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:30.700]   Now it's 27.
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:32.380]   But I mean, that's not the point.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:38.900]   The point is that I want you to put 20, 25% of the cash that you're making into an inflationary
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:44.780]   proof method of storage, either for when you go to go buy land or your son has to go to
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:49.420]   college, whatever, an inflationary proof method, he goes, okay.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:53.060]   And so he goes off on Craig's list.
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:58.740]   He starts buying, you know, silver that people are selling that, you know, basically at spot.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.340]   And he goes, Steve, well, what should I do with the rest of my money?
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.700]   It's like, well, we got to do something better than bank interest.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:11.020]   We need to find something that we can buy cheap now that will sell, sell for a lot more
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:14.420]   soon and that's relatively dense.
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:16.400]   It's not big and fluffy.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:23.540]   So we came up with propane and kerosene torpedo heaters, especially the really nice ones like
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:28.220]   you use on construction sites or in your garage, because they're, you know, they're, they're,
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:35.060]   they're fairly compact, you know, compared to a furnace and he's buying them for 40 to
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:36.780]   $50 each right now.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:41.500]   I mean, he's only, he's cherry picking the nice ones off of Facebook marketplace and
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.220]   he's stacking them up in his garage on shelves and everything else.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:48.860]   And he cleans them, makes them look nice, checks them all out.
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:51.340]   They all work or he fixes a few of them.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:52.340]   No big deal.
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:57.180]   Some of the ones he's got for 40 bucks are worth $400 brand new.
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:03.980]   Some of the ones he's got for 50 bucks are worth 150 on the use market in the winter.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:13.580]   But the point is he is going to double and triple and quadruple his money that he's paying
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.020]   for now.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:22.820]   And we started this in July, August, in January, February, when it's frigid cold in Michigan
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:28.620]   and everyone wants a heater for whatever reason, he is going to be getting way better than
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:33.180]   bank interest on that six month turnaround.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:40.260]   And that's all because of the teachings that you teach people on radical personal finance
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:44.500]   that we took and modified for our own purposes.
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.500]   So thank you, Josh.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:46.500]   My pleasure.
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:47.500]   I love it.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:55.020]   I would say to any listener listening that don't, so first, awesome for him.
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.420]   He's going to do great.
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:59.940]   And what will happen is let's talk about the life cycle that he will go through in his
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:01.000]   life.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.360]   Right now, $750 a week is life-changing money for him.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.140]   And his ability to do this with heaters will grow and he'll be able to grow it.
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:16.180]   If he continues doing that, he will run out of heaters to buy.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:19.060]   He'll saturate the market, the numbers will get too big.
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:23.920]   And so you'll take then now the same method of thinking and you'll apply it to something
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.940]   else, to a bigger market.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:31.540]   But if you are already in the bigger market, let's say that you already have an income
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:37.540]   higher, et cetera, make sure that you recognize how easily you could teach a 15-year-old,
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:43.300]   a thoughtful, intelligent 15-year-old how to do what that man is doing.
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:50.040]   And if you teach that 15-year-old how to do it, just think from now on when they're offered
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:53.660]   a job and someone says, "Hey, listen, come over here and I'll pay you $12 an hour," and
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:59:00.700]   they look and realize, "Well, I can make $100 to $300 profit per freezer that I flip," all
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.500]   of a sudden you've dramatically transformed the ability of a 15-year-old to generate income
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:06.500]   for themselves.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:10.420]   And that sets someone free for life when they know how to buy and trade and sell.
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:14.220]   So do it yourself and teach your children to do it.
[01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:22.100]   And Sean went and learned HVAC for appliances online on YouTube, bought the stuff, second-hand
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:23.900]   surplus used online.
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:26.100]   But I mean, it was the quality stuff.
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.380]   It wasn't the Harbor Freight stuff.
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.900]   It was like the really good stuff.
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:34.060]   So he bought it for $0.30 on the dollar and then he tested it, played with it, and taught
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:37.580]   himself further just on a unit that he got.
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:40.500]   And it's like, "Okay, I'm going to suck this thing down and recharge it.
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:41.500]   Okay, I did that.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:43.340]   I'm going to find the leak and repair it."
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.100]   This is all stuff you can teach yourself.
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:48.620]   You don't need to go to a trade school or a university to do this.
[01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:53.540]   This is stuff that you can do that is under your own control.
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:58.100]   And that is the important lesson.
[01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:04.780]   And when I went to an abbreviated law enforcement academy because I was in the sheriff reserve,
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:08.340]   not a full-time sheriff deputy, I was law enforcement.
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:12.140]   I was uniformed and badged and had a gun and arrest powers.
[02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:17.660]   But I was only a sheriff deputy when I was on duty versus a regular LEO, law enforcement
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:21.300]   officer, as a law enforcement officer all the time.
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:26.060]   So I went through an abbreviated academy because we don't have to do traffic stops and everything.
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:32.460]   We're doing crowd control and other civic engagements and stuff like that.
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:35.340]   So anyways, I had really, really great instructors.
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:41.300]   Some of the best instructors always took their time to come and teach the reservists because
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:45.300]   they wanted us to have the best training because we were backing up and helping the regular
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:47.740]   police officers.
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:51.820]   And you're never going to forget this, Josh, and no one ever here listening is going to
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:53.820]   forget this short story.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:58.100]   There is a lecture that he called "Turning the Wheel of the Boat."
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:06.060]   And the premise is, what if the guy behind the rudder wheel of the Titanic moved it just
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:11.740]   a smidgen to the left three days before they hit the iceberg?
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:13.680]   They would have never hit the iceberg.
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.780]   They would have gone south out of the iceberg area, a little bit more southern route to
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:22.860]   New York, and they would have never entered the iceberg field just because they turned
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:27.020]   the rudder a little bit three days previous.
[02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:29.820]   Well, the same concept applies to people.
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:31.740]   And this is done in law enforcement.
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:37.300]   It's like, what if I take an extra 30 seconds with this young man and talk to him?
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.220]   What if there's a kid in trouble, did something bad?
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:44.580]   Well, I'm going to take the extra 30 minutes and I'm going to handcuff him.
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:49.380]   And he's going to be cited and released.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:56.340]   But I take the long way and I walk him through the worst portions of the jail or the prison
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:01.980]   where the people are hooting and hollering and yelling at the young kid and saying awfully
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:08.220]   mean sexual things to him and letting him feel like the piece of meat he's going to
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:15.940]   be as a fresh fish going into the incarceration field of a prison or a jail.
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:18.600]   And it scares the living crap out of him.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:26.000]   What if I did that in an effort to change the wheel a little bit for that young person's
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000]   future?
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.760]   Will I ever know what he avoided because I did that?
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:32.600]   No, I never will.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:39.600]   And hopefully he avoids a life of crime and goes into something that's not a life of crime
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:42.720]   and has a wonderful, prosperous life.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:49.840]   So that's the analogy in spending an extra three minutes with a woman who's being abused
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.480]   who does not want help.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:58.340]   I mean, what can I do with an extra three minutes to change her life and her children?
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:04.360]   What if I get a shelter on my cell phone and it's called Marjorie, I got a lady you need
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:07.600]   to talk to, hand her my cell phone, they talk to her.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.800]   And so she talks to her woman, the woman for three minutes, and she goes, okay, I'm going
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.640]   to come on down.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.160]   That's what we call steering the wheel.
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:20.720]   You're doing the same thing with us financially by teaching a 15-year-old how to buy something
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:27.720]   cheap or learn a new skill or do something that they've never thought of before.
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:31.480]   A lot of people don't do things in this world because people don't tell them, you can do
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.480]   that.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.040]   I was told that all my life, you can do anything you want.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.760]   Just go learn and go do it.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:44.080]   And that's what you and I and in your regular class and in my preparedness classes, I'm
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:46.200]   telling people, you can do this.
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.840]   It's under your own control.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.840]   Go do it.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:51.360]   You have nothing to lose.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.000]   Even if you fail, you're going to learn.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.800]   Steer your own wheel.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:01.360]   Change the direction of the boat for your children, for your grandchildren, for your
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.400]   20 and 30-year-old kids.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.560]   The guy I'm talking about is 32 years old.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.560]   I'm 52.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.000]   He's a kid.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.960]   I'm changing his life dramatically with what he's doing because I'm actually turning his
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.840]   wheel pretty radically.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.680]   He's putting sails up and everything.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:22.440]   He's going full speed ahead, which is a rarity in people.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:29.480]   I think that is one of the great values of what you are giving to your people and I'm
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:35.000]   giving to my people is we're getting them to turn their wheel a little bit so they never
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.040]   have to deal with the Titanic hitting the iceberg, sinking and lifeboats and flares
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.040]   and radio calls and everything else.
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:50.360]   That bad thing never happened because they steered the wheel 10 years, 3 years, 1 year
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.520]   before they would have hit it.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:05:00.280]   Now that you got that financial security, you got the freedom to actually do more things.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.200]   Your son wants to learn HVAC.
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.360]   He needs $450 worth of equipment.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.800]   He needs a used set of gauges.
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.120]   He needs a vacuum pump.
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:14.640]   He needs a refrigerant recovery bottle.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.760]   He needs a bottle of refrigerant and everything else.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:21.240]   It's like, "Oh, grandson?
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.320]   Yeah, go find it on Facebook.
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:27.440]   I'll buy it."
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:28.920]   You don't care about $450.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.040]   You just throw him the $450 and say, "Go have fun.
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.520]   That's your education."
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:38.120]   I used to tell people in the 1990s and early 2000s, they go, "Steve, what's the best
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.400]   thing I can do for my child's education?"
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:44.000]   I go, "Buy any book they want."
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.040]   At the time, the website was called Half.com.
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.040]   It was used books.
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.040]   They're gone.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:54.400]   But there's still Libris and Abooks and Amazon.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:57.440]   We didn't have as much digital media.
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:00.840]   Now YouTube didn't exist then either.
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.720]   It was like, "Buy your child all the books that they want."
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:09.000]   It's like, "Well, just let them loose on the used bookstores."
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000]   "Well, there's a library."
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:15.680]   "Yeah, the library's not on your shelf at 2 a.m. that you can go look at and read."
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:17.520]   I have a saying for a long time.
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:21.760]   A person's wealth is not measured by the numbers in their bank account.
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:27.840]   The person's wealth is measured by the size of their personal library.
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:31.120]   But that was something I used to tell people back then.
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:32.560]   "Buy your children books."
[02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:36.600]   Whatever, $100 a month, $50 a month, $30 a month, whatever they want, buy them the books.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.680]   It's the best thing you're going to do for them.
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:42.520]   The other thing I got into was someone they were talking about.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.520]   They wrote to me.
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:44.840]   It's like, "Oh, I lost my job."
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:46.240]   I go, "You didn't lose your job.
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:49.040]   You just got set free."
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:54.320]   He made the excuse that, "Well, it's my Christmas present to buy my USB drive," which we'll
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:57.720]   talk about in a second, "full of preparedness knowledge."
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:58.720]   I go, "What do you mean?
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:02.600]   You can take what's in there and you can start making battery banks and inverter kits and
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:03.600]   everything else.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:07.800]   You can sell them to people using the California wildfires.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:09.160]   It's an investment in your future.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:14.880]   Why are you making an excuse?"
[02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:19.340]   In this world, you don't make money by pursuing money.
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:23.820]   You make money by pursuing knowledge and ability.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:32.560]   If you pursue knowledge, information, knowledge, ability, experience, and eventually wisdom,
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:38.800]   which you only get when you're into your 50s, if you pursue those rather than trying to
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:44.300]   pursue money, as in the slave to the wage, the money will follow you.
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:49.840]   If you have the knowledge and the ability, people will try to throw you money to get
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:53.960]   you to do things for them, and good amounts of money.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:56.600]   Okay, I'm done lecturing.
[02:07:56.600 --> 02:07:57.600]   It's true.
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:03.580]   I was earlier going to mention, and I think we'd be remiss in talking about commodities
[02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:06.760]   and investing in storing stuff if we didn't.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:13.500]   What are your thoughts on storing nickels?
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:15.520]   I think it's an internet thing.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:23.720]   I mean, technically, it's illegal for you to melt them down and to turn them into a
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:27.000]   commodity, and they actually watch and look for that.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.400]   The same thing with copper pennies.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:36.280]   You can't convert them into a commodity because they're already in a different form that's
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.840]   illegal to convert into a commodity.
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:50.600]   The famous Pawn Stars on the History Channel, the old man who died of Parkinson's recently,
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:09:00.960]   he had 55-gallon drums full of pre-83, pre-82 pennies that were all copper.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:06.840]   You're just waiting for the time when he could melt those down and turn them in because copper
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:13.400]   was four or something, or $5 a pound on the commodities market.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:22.080]   He died before he ever could do it, and he did it for decades and decades and decades.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:27.640]   I think it's worth talking about.
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:33.560]   Let me make the positive argument for investing in nickels.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:39.040]   The basic idea is, when Steve talks about going on Facebook and buying junk silver,
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:46.080]   what he means is buying pre-1965 US dimes, quarters, and half dollars.
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:50.320]   Prior to 1965, those coins were made of 90% silver.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:54.120]   They've since been adulterated, so they don't have any silver content, right?
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.920]   I don't think they have any silver content now.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:56.920]   None.
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:57.920]   None.
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:58.920]   None.
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:09:59.920]   Zero.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:00.920]   In fact, pennies are mostly zinc.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:01.920]   Right.
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:02.920]   Agreed.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:06.920]   So, very quickly, people started to recognize when they changed what was in the coins, and
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.880]   they debased the metal value that was in the coins.
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:15.280]   Very quickly, people recognized the value, and they pulled those coins out of circulation.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.500]   So now, if you want to buy silver coins, one of the simplest ways to do it is just to purchase
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.400]   that US currency.
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:25.800]   It has some advantages, some significant advantages.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:30.600]   The first advantage is that it's very recognizable as currency.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.240]   If you can just simply look, you know what a quarter looks like, you know what a dime
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.560]   looks like, and you look at the date, and it says before 1965, you know, okay, this
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.200]   is 90% silver.
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:42.200]   But they trade in value based upon their silver content.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:50.240]   However, because they are so small in both size and in value, it's really not worth anybody's
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:52.960]   time and hassle to try to counterfeit it.
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:56.560]   People will try to pass off a counterfeit one-ounce Krugerrand, but I've never heard
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.200]   of anybody trying to pass off a counterfeit US dime.
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.680]   And so you get basically a counterfeit proof, although it's not necessarily proof, but you've
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:10.680]   got a very hard to counterfeit coin that has a certain metal value in it because of it.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:14.080]   So that's US dimes, quarters, and half dollars.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.760]   And I think that that's worth it.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:18.280]   I think it's a good argument.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.080]   It's an easy way for someone to purchase some silver at a low cost where they can recognize
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:24.480]   it, etc.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:27.800]   The problem is, of course, the denominations are rather small.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:32.800]   And so if you're going to have $1,000 of this stuff, I mean, it's not that big, but when
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:37.160]   you get into the tens of thousands of dollars, it becomes really, really significant in terms
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:38.280]   of the storage space.
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.040]   That's just the case with silver.
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:44.360]   Now if we fast forward, you have still two other things.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.440]   So first you have old pennies, which is what Steve just mentioned, that had high copper
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:49.440]   content.
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.380]   That is no longer the case.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:56.400]   But the one thing that you do still have, the one single US coin that does still have
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:00.880]   its base metal being very high, is the US nickel, which has a high percentage of nickel
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:01.880]   in it.
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:08.160]   And so you can calculate the melt value, which is something like 80-ish percent of the coin
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.560]   is made of nickel.
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:15.320]   And so right now, a current melt value, if you took a US nickel that you can buy for
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:20.960]   five cents and you melted it down, in theory it would have just over four cents worth of
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.120]   melt value of nickel in it.
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:28.440]   And so the argument is that if you purchase nickels, and by purchase I just mean you take
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:34.000]   a dollar and they give you 20 nickels, you can store nickels and those nickels will have
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.400]   the face amount of the currency.
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.520]   So you're not going to lose anything with your investment amount because it's always
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.520]   going to have the face amount of the currency.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.640]   Five dollar roll of nickels is worth five dollars, whether that's today or five years
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:49.640]   in the future.
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:50.640]   It's worth five dollars.
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.760]   It's never worth less than five dollars.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.680]   But if you move into an inflationary period, and if that inflation adjusts the value of
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:04.760]   nickel, then in theory the nickels would start to trade.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:08.520]   You would guess that the mint would change the composition of nickels, and then the nickels
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:14.880]   would start to trade based upon their metal value, not based exclusively on their face
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:15.880]   value.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:16.880]   So that's the positive argument.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:19.480]   Well, they're not made out of pure nickel.
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.880]   They're 75% copper and 25% nickel as of right now.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:30.960]   Okay, so but they still do have the melt value of the nickel is still four cents.
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:37.080]   So I was reading the melt percentage of the nomination figure from coinflation.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:41.000]   So whatever the actual formula is, they do have the nickel value.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:47.760]   And so the argument is that it's a basically a can't lose proposition because either you
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:55.400]   always have the face value of the coin, which is a totally fungible coin, or you have the
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:57.120]   melt value of the nickel.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:58.120]   That's the argument.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:00.000]   Now there are a number of downsides, right?
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.240]   So the point you made, Steve, is that it's illegal to melt them down.
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:09.600]   So and nickel is not nearly as valuable in terms of cost per weight as something like
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.600]   silver is.
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:14.880]   And so you wouldn't really expect someone to melt them down, try to purify it, etc.
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.440]   They're also extremely bulky.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:23.960]   You know, if it's hard to store silver dimes and quarters, it's even harder to store nickels.
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:28.280]   But it's an interesting thing to think about when it comes to commodities, and I think
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.720]   an interesting argument.
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:41.320]   The 1946 to 2014 nickel, the five cent nickel is worth right now as of September 17, 2020,
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:44.440]   it's worth 4.1 cents.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:45.440]   Right.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:53.240]   And I can't even, I can't find the value of the 2015 to 2020 nickel on coin inflation
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.240]   right now.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.240]   Right, right.
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:15:00.000]   Yeah, so the argument is that it's never going to be worth less than five cents.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.440]   And you have a 20% range between the face value of the coin and the melt value of the
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.440]   nickel.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.480]   So, you know, if you have a 20% increase in values, then now you're in depositive territory
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:12.480]   with the nickel.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.840]   So anyway, we don't have to spend too much time on it.
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:16.840]   It's an interesting thing.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:23.480]   The biggest problem with it, as with any commodity, is that it's hard to store the things.
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.360]   And the nice thing is it's easy, it's not so easy to spend nickels, I guess though in
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:32.400]   the current coin shortage, maybe it's easier than it once was, but you can spend nickels.
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.400]   It's hard to spend ingots of lead at a store, but still at the end of the day, you know,
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:42.240]   you're filling ammo cans or something with nickels, and it's pretty, pretty heavy stuff.
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:44.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:50.440]   I think the best thing we've talked about is the inflationary proof methods of storage
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.200]   of money other than gold and silver.
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:16:02.360]   And the actually the ways you can buy things on the used market surplus and actually have
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.540]   something that is going to be worth more money.
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:06.600]   It's worth more money right now.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:11.840]   If I bought all those pieces of tool steel at $50, I could go someplace else and sell
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:14.320]   them for probably a hundred dollars.
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:16.640]   But I mean, you're starting off to the positive.
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:22.240]   And the other thing about, you know, being a world traveler like you are, you got a Honda
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.560]   EU 2200i generator.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:30.160]   Now those are about $1,100 to $1,200 brand new here in the United States.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.760]   You actually couldn't get them for a while because of the stupidity of Honda and recall.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:41.200]   But let's say you went to a Latin American company country and you bought one of those
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:47.600]   very good condition used and you paid $700 for it.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:55.960]   Well now let's say you're going to move down to Peru for whatever reason, and you can't
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:58.840]   take your stuff with you because you don't own your stuff.
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.300]   Your stuff owns you.
[02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:06.120]   You can't really take it and drive that distance with it through those countries to get there.
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:15.520]   So you go and it's like you go on to your, you go to the, what's it called?
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:21.000]   The bazaar or the flea market or whatever you have, or whatever your equivalent of Facebook
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.920]   marketplace or Craigslist is down there.
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.800]   And you sell your $700 generator.
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:31.120]   Well you will, you'll sell it for $650 or $700.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:32.720]   So you got your money out of it.
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:37.960]   And at worst you lost 50 bucks on it because that Honda generator is always going to have
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:39.400]   a value for it.
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:43.320]   That Honda generator is sought after around the world.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:48.480]   You know, if, if, if anyone is going anywhere out into the wilderness and Alaska and they're
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:54.720]   all using the Honda generators, it's recognized around the world as being pretty much the
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:57.040]   most reliable generator there is.
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:01.880]   That's a gasoline or propane or natural gas based generator.
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:05.840]   So if you buy it used and it's like, yeah, now you've got that bulk.
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:11.400]   I mean, you got that thing that you need at your location that you're in and you know,
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:14.640]   it's there for when you need it and you needed it at the other day.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:27.160]   But yet when you go to move or travel again, you can reconvert it back into a Fiat, travel
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:33.360]   to your new place and buy another one on the use market and very, very good condition.
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:38.200]   And now you, now you got your generator back and it was by far cheaper than all the expenses
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:43.520]   you would have gone through of shipping or hauling it, you know, to the other location.
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:44.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:50.200]   And I think that's the value of physical items and where if you get comfortable, I mean,
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.920]   I think a basic skill that we should help everyone to develop, whether they always use
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:56.440]   it or not, that's up to them.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:01.480]   But a basic skill that we should help everybody to develop is the skill of buying and selling
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:03.480]   things in the local markets.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:07.520]   And this has become so much easier with Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist and whatever other
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:09.280]   versions there are.
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:14.880]   I mean, my little quip that I've used for years is simply store your stuff on Craigslist.
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.760]   That if you just simply store your stuff on Craigslist, you can always go back and get
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.840]   it up, but get it back if you need it.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:23.520]   And I have several times given advice to people.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.480]   Recently I was talking to somebody who was trying to move.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.400]   They were trying to move from Florida to North Carolina and they were trying to figure out
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:32.880]   how they could split a moving truck with somebody.
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.440]   And I just said, "Look at the stuff that you have, okay?
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:37.560]   None of this stuff is worth moving.
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:41.680]   Just simply sell all of it and move in your car, right?
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:45.960]   Load up your small valuable items that you can move with in your small car, sell all
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.960]   of this stuff, move in your car, and then when you get to North Carolina, replace it
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:50.960]   little by little."
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:54.400]   And you're not dealing with sales tax.
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:55.400]   You're not dealing with...
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.880]   I mean, you can do it very easily.
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:01.680]   And even if you lose a few hundred bucks, you still are better off than paying a lot
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:03.360]   of money for a moving truck.
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:04.360]   And so...
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:06.400]   Seventy-nine cents a mile.
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:07.400]   It can be done.
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:10.760]   And it's cheaper to take your car and pay a little bit extra.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.840]   And what you'll do the next time through...
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:16.880]   Some people often think, "Man, what a relief it would be if my house burned down because
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:17.880]   then I could start again."
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:21.120]   Well, a move can be that chance that you can start again.
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:25.520]   And the next time around, you buy better, you buy smarter, you buy more patiently, and
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.520]   you get better deals.
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.960]   It's a skill that you can build and develop.
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:29.960]   So I think that's...
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.120]   And you get the newest version of whatever you had.
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:33.120]   Yeah, it's true.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:34.120]   All right, Steve.
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:36.120]   I think that's two hours and 21 minutes.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.940]   It's a pretty mammoth show, and I think we got some good stuff.
[02:20:38.940 --> 02:20:42.200]   Anything that we missed or anything that you'd like to cover before we close?
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.560]   Yes.
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:52.000]   Steven Harris Preparedness is available through a link that helps support Josh.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:58.680]   And I got a couple of things up there, and I'm changing everything around with the way
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:01.000]   I sell things and deliver things.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:09.800]   But if you want to go see the best of what I have, and you go to RFP for Radical Personal
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:17.760]   Finance, you go to RPF1234.com.
[02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:38.480]   That will automatically drop you onto the right page on my site via what Josh is doing.
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:44.480]   And you can take a look at all the stuff that I have and decide what part of my educational
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.600]   system you want to go into.
[02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:49.600]   There's plenty of stuff up there for free.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:55.120]   Basically, you can listen to almost everything for free if you want to see the videos, and
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:59.080]   then you end up purchasing the videos from me.
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:04.320]   But I mean, some of my videos, stuff you're going to learn from me, I'm very detailed
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.320]   on my videos.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:08.680]   And do you think, how does three bucks an hour sound, Josh?
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:11.120]   Is that like too expensive for a quality education?
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:14.560]   Josh Cote I guess what I should say that will be a louder
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:18.320]   testimonial of your stuff than anything else is very simple.
[02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:23.320]   I think I have bought previously, like I told you, I think I've bought every product you've
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:24.960]   ever sold.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:28.880]   And I think I've consumed, at least of everything I've ever found on your websites and stuff
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:32.680]   that you've found, I think I've consumed all of the public stuff that you've said.
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:37.480]   And so if we were to total that up, let's see, I bought all your earlier videos, your
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:41.160]   bug out bag video, your battery backup video.
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:45.880]   And then when you launched a membership site, I joined that as I was one of your founding
[02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:48.040]   people with your initial membership site.
[02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:53.760]   And then I lost my credentials and we got mixed up with all of that.
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:57.000]   And so then when the pandemic came around, I saw that you were doing more stuff and I
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.880]   went up and bought another, I don't know what I paid for.
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:04.080]   Anyway, I think I've sent you at least probably four, I don't know, five, $600 over the years.
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:09.440]   So the point is that I have never regretted any of the money that I have spent with you.
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:15.480]   And I consider you to be a very thoughtful, intelligent teacher who is able to focus on
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:19.080]   systems that work rather than specific solutions.
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:22.540]   And to me, that's a powerful way of thinking.
[02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:28.760]   When you understand systems and you understand that knowledge can be applied in many circumstances,
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:31.400]   it has basically allowed me with other stuff, right?
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:33.520]   I spend lots of money on education.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:36.400]   I take a certain percentage of my income and I always spend it on education.
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.240]   So I'm in some ways an easier sell than some other people.
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:44.980]   But what it's helped me to do is it's helped me to feel incredibly confident in almost
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:45.980]   any circumstance.
[02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:49.800]   I mean, you did stuff on food preparation, right?
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:54.240]   And a while ago, you did a thing about making corn into food and you did this whole big
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:55.240]   video about it.
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:59.400]   And so what that gives me the knowledge of is as a father of four children, I know that
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:05.880]   if I'm in the United States and I am running low on money, I can take my car, I'll go find
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:11.480]   a grain elevator somewhere where I can buy sacks of corn and I'll buy sacks of corn and
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:15.480]   my children will never go hungry because I know how to take it and how to make it into
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:18.160]   food that they can eat and that they'll enjoy eating.
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:23.000]   And so that knowledge, if for no other reason, having the confidence of knowing how to do
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:26.880]   stuff is extremely valuable and well worth paying for.
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.080]   So I've never regretted any of the money that I've spent with you.
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:30.080]   Yep.
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:37.400]   I bought in the pandemic shopping video, I went to Tractor Supply Store, which is a little
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:40.000]   bit more money than buying from the grain elevator.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.300]   But I bought 800 pounds of corn.
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:50.960]   They even loaded it into my truck for me and I bought it for $105.
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:53.800]   That is awfully, awfully cheap food.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.600]   And the number of things you can make out of corn is extensive.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:01.280]   I mean, it's huge.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:12.280]   I mean, the food that fed the slaves and the poor in the 17 and 18 and 1900s was corn.
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:14.520]   That's what they ate on a daily basis.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:22.240]   From hoe cakes to Johnny cakes to polenta to cornbread.
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:24.580]   It was the grain.
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:30.560]   People would raise and they would raise and grow wheat and they would sell their wheat
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:35.160]   because it was three times more expensive than corn.
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:40.600]   And then they would go buy corn for their family from a different person.
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:45.040]   And that was their food for the rest of the year.
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:49.440]   But even when they grew the wheat, they sold the wheat and bought the corn.
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:53.200]   And I'll tell you why that kind of stuff is so important to me.
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.880]   Just like you, I don't want to eat corn every day.
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.320]   Although I could and I could make it good.
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:25:58.320]   I don't want to.
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:02.560]   I eat a lot of meat and my freezer is packed full of meat.
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:07.000]   That's my primary food method, preparedness plan is a freezer full of meat.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.720]   But what I use the corn for is of course to know and I would eat it if I were hungry.
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:17.920]   But what I use it for is an inexpensive way of me supporting people that I care about
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:20.420]   that I can't get to take care of themselves.
[02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:25.720]   And so I have a very, very large network of people that I care about that I would never
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:27.820]   turn away from my door hungry.
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:35.520]   But how on earth do I afford to provide for dozens of people if there are shortages, if
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:36.760]   there are needs for food?
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:43.720]   I can't afford to have fancy food for them, but I can afford giant piles of corn.
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:44.720]   It's not hard for me.
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:49.200]   Okay, I spent 500 bucks on corn, but I could feed 100 people for weeks and weeks on that.
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.500]   Okay, I'm sold.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:54.280]   And so to me, that's one of the reasons why things like that are so valuable is it allows
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:58.880]   me to be prepared to care for people in my network that I need to care for who are not
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:02.680]   going to, either they're not going to or they're not going to be able to care for themselves.
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.160]   And I can do it by mastering these methods.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:06.160]   Yep, yep.
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:08.680]   And like I said, people are the resources.
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:12.480]   Well, you and your wife are sleeping peaceably all night.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:16.240]   You know, you're the people that are helping you that you are feeding and everything you
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.240]   go.
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:24.680]   Dave, John, Steve and Joe, you're on watch all night, you know, two hour shifts, you
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:29.560]   know, 12 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8.
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.140]   You got the night vision goggles on and you're sitting out there on the porch with a shotgun
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:37.920]   just being quiet, keeping an eye out.
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:42.360]   You know, if any if anything happens, you push the button on the bow thing and you go,
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:44.520]   wake up, wake up, wake up.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.520]   And you know, I'll wake up and we'll wake everyone up and get armed up and you know,
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:55.720]   watch what's going on or it could be the same thing if you're on a farm.
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:02.040]   Now you're out there watching the cows like someone's coming in to steal your beef.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.420]   You know, someone needs to be on overwatch all night.
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:13.180]   You're dealing with harder methods of food and water and labor and you need strong backs
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:17.620]   and skilled minds and everything for all of that.
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:22.100]   And it's a lot easier with a lot of people and all you had to do was buy $100 worth of
[02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:28.340]   corn and you got help for all the help you need for months with it.
[02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:32.020]   So that's a pretty powerful currency.
[02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:40.380]   I mean, that's a very cheap way of hiring labor when you need it the most is with food
[02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:41.380]   like that.
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:43.600]   Because I guarantee you, what did I tell you?
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:45.640]   Your first priority is breathing.
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:48.160]   Your second priority is hydrate.
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:50.440]   Actually your first priority is breathing.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:55.860]   Your second priority is temperature, either staying cool or staying warm.
[02:28:55.860 --> 02:29:01.960]   Your next priority is thirst and your next priority is hunger.
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:09.060]   And for most people as base needs in human beings.
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:11.740]   And so all those things will happen to people.
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:17.020]   They're going to, you know, if they're cold, tired, thirsty and hungry, they'll be showing
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:18.020]   up at your door.
[02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:25.420]   And if you can satisfy any part of cold, thirsty and hungry, you got people who will be very
[02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:28.780]   happy to you because they don't want to go back into those states.
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:32.420]   It's like, "Hey, can you help me with this?
[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:33.420]   Oh yeah, you bet.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:34.420]   You name it.
[02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:35.420]   I'll help you all day long."
[02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:36.420]   Right.
[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:38.620]   And people are the biggest resource that we have.
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:43.660]   All of your and my problems are always going to be solved by people and all of humanity's
[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:46.260]   problems are always going to be solved by people.
[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:49.740]   And so the more people you can have on your team, the better.
[02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:55.180]   And so sometimes stockpiling those basic supplies, if they go short, those can make all the
[02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:56.220]   difference in the world.
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:01.900]   And when you have the intelligence of a group of people and you can meet a few basic needs,
[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:03.300]   you're well set up.
[02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:06.900]   So RPF1234 is an affiliate link.
[02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:11.700]   So if you'd like to do that, I would highly encourage you to go to rpf1234.com.
[02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:13.940]   Check out all of Steve's products.
[02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:15.580]   Again, I think I own everything you do.
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.180]   If I don't, I'll buy it.
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:20.100]   And I have benefited immensely from it.
[02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:22.020]   I've tried to get Steven to get more stuff.
[02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:25.900]   Recently we were talking and I tried to get him to start creating more stuff because he's
[02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:31.620]   got more, as is my problem, you know, both of us have more knowledge in our head that
[02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:35.860]   we had struggled to get out because of the difficulty of getting it out in a form that
[02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:37.220]   it can be consumed.
[02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:41.660]   And so it's really, we've got to keep on streamlining that and getting more stuff out so you can
[02:30:41.660 --> 02:30:44.860]   get the knowledge out into a form that it can be gained by other people.
[02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:48.260]   Yeah, I'm going to die with 20 lifetimes.
[02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:52.220]   20 lifetimes of inventions never, never done.
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:56.220]   Well, at least get a few of them out.
[02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:58.700]   Well, Steve, thank you for coming on.
[02:30:58.700 --> 02:30:59.700]   RPF1234.com.
[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:02.820]   Any closing thoughts as I wrap this up?
[02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:04.260]   No, no.
[02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:08.420]   Again, take what we have taught you and make it your own.
[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:12.540]   Modify it for your own purposes and by all means do it.
[02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:13.540]   Okay.
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:16.100]   I don't care if you just do one step today.
[02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:21.580]   As long as you take a step forward every day or every week that you can.
[02:31:21.580 --> 02:31:27.180]   And don't say you don't have time for it because you do have time for it.
[02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:29.340]   You can make time for it.
[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:35.620]   And even if it's 10 minutes this week, that 10 minutes of taking what we've advised you
[02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:39.220]   on making it your own and doing it.
[02:31:39.220 --> 02:31:47.900]   I have become so belligerent in the pandemic, literally berating people.
[02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:50.780]   We're dealing with a life and death situation.
[02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:55.940]   They ask me a question and then they immediately find a reason to not do it.
[02:31:55.940 --> 02:32:01.660]   They immediately talk themselves out of doing the advice that I'm giving them.
[02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:05.780]   And they find it, I call it, they find a reason not to do it.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:11.100]   Start finding reasons to not do it and start finding reasons to do it.
[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:12.100]   Agreed.
[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:13.380]   Totally agree.
[02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:19.900]   And if you capture the knowledge, then if you are behind, if you're behind, I mean,
[02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:25.820]   you sell at the, you know, rpf1234.com, you're selling the USB stick, right?
[02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:28.300]   That is available with all the stuff.
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:34.860]   The nice thing is that even if you find yourself caught behind the curve and you promote a
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:40.860]   lot, Steve, when there's a hurricane coming, the hurricane has several days of lead time.
[02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:44.180]   And if you know what you would need to do if a hurricane were coming, even if you have
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:46.260]   a few days, you can take action.
[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:47.540]   But even so, you don't want to do that.
[02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:48.540]   You want to take action quickly.
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.060]   So, all right, we've preached enough.
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:55.660]   Steve, thank you for coming on and rpf1234.com, rpf1234.com and I'll be back with you very
