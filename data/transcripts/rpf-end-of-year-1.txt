[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Hey, radicals, welcome to the podcast today.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Today's episode will be very short.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.800]   This is essentially an audio Christmas card from me to you.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.120]   Just wanted to simply say thank you for being here.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.720]   Thank you for listening to the show.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.400]   I am in the process of shutting things down for the year.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.360]   As I record this, it is Friday afternoon, December 18 at 1 o'clock PM, and I'm shutting
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.240]   down the computer and I'm going to go and spend some time helping my wife clean up the
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   house.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   I'm going to come over tonight, going to hang out and sing some songs, play some music together.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.760]   So I'm going to go help my wife clean the bathrooms.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.000]   The very glamorous life of a podcaster, right?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.160]   But as we close the show today, I had intended to do a kind of state of the show for you
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.680]   and tell you about the changes that are coming next year.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680]   I'm not quite ready to do that today.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.240]   So you can expect that early next year.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.080]   But I just wanted to record a thank you message from me to you.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.160]   The last year of my life has been a truly amazing year.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.760]   I love to sit down and think about the year in retrospect.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.720]   My life is in some ways very orderly in this sense.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.700]   My birthday is in June and New Year's is in January.
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.360]   So every six months I have a beautiful opportunity to assess my progress, assess how things are
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.400]   going and see what things need corrections.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.760]   And considering the calendar year of 2015, it's really been an incredible year.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.560]   We sold a house, continued growing a business.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.880]   The business has started to really gain traction and some attention.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.620]   Just last night I got a link from a reader letting me know that Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.680]   had been mentioned on Lifehacker, which was cool.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.600]   That's a good week for publicity of the show, a New York Times article and Lifehacker.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   So that was exciting.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   The show was starting to gain traction.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.440]   It's been a great year, over one and a quarter million downloads of the show over the however
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.960]   many episodes we did.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520]   It's been a great year personally for us.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.280]   We had another baby, which was awesome.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.800]   Also it was a very challenging year because she was sick, sick, sick for the first three
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   months and that combined with selling my house at the same time and all of those things made
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   for a very challenging three months.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.800]   I appreciate all of you who've stuck with me.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.760]   The fourth quarter of 2015 was my least productive quarter in terms of show content and it was
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.480]   primarily due to taking care of my daughter.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.920]   I'll share more about that in the future.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040]   But it was a challenging time.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   But she's doing great now.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.140]   She's been doing very well for the last month.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.360]   So things are really looking up around the Sheets household and I tell you, just being
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   free of the house in the last couple of weeks has made a world of difference, like a giant
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.300]   weight lifted off my shoulders and allows me to plan and execute without having to deal
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   with that component.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000]   So 2016 is going to be a very exciting year.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.760]   I've got big plans, big dreams, big plans, all kinds of ideas.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.960]   I've got to keep discipline to actually execute on the ideas.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.040]   I'm very good at coming up with ideas.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.320]   But like many people, executing on all my ideas is much more challenging and ideas are
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.600]   a dime a dozen and execution is incredibly valuable.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.080]   But by making some exciting changes in my personal life, exciting changes in the business
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.360]   life as far as streamlining some of the â€“ getting rid of some of the bottlenecks that have really
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.880]   affected the show.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.160]   So I'll share those with you in the new year.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.560]   We're going to be doing new formats, new types of shows, lots of plans.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.780]   So that will be coming next year.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.280]   For now, I just want to simply say thank you.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.400]   Thank you to each and every one of you who listens to the show.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.640]   I can't tell you how much it means to me.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.680]   Your time is valuable and I recognize that.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.120]   And frankly, I walk away from every show and I think, "Man, was that worth it?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   Was that good?
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.920]   Did it make sense?"
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.360]   And thank you for those of you who email me with your little notes of encouragement and
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.520]   tell me the things that were helpful.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.120]   And I just want to do a good job for you.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.360]   I want to share with you ideas and content that is going to make an impact in your life.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.240]   So thank you for listening.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.440]   Thank you for your dedicating your time to me and to the ideas that I have to share with
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   you.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   I hope they have been impactful.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   I hope this last year for you has been a year of growth.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.600]   I hope you're making measurable progress or how did Jim Rohn used to say it, "Meaningful
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.640]   progress and measurable time or in reasonable time."
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.080]   I hope that you're experiencing growth in every aspect of your life.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.880]   As we go into the end of the year, just a couple tips for you.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.440]   If you have some time over the holidays, if you haven't done it yet, spend some time reflecting
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.640]   on the past year.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.600]   Spend some time reflecting on the next year and consider some little changes that might
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.960]   further help you to move towards your goals.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.280]   The most important thing is spend some time thinking about your goals.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.240]   If you've not taken the time ever to sit down and write down goals, just do it very simply.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.920]   Make a list of 10 goals you'd like to accomplish in the next year.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.400]   And then here's the key to actually making things happen.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   Start figuring out what types of actions, specific actions and ideas and specific things
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.520]   you would need to do to make progress toward those goals.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.040]   This is a really great time of year to do it because you can map it out.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.280]   Now if you're like me and you enjoy the hardcore process of having every little detail written
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.120]   down on paper, then go for it.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.000]   But if you're not a nerd like me, then just do it big picture and think about some goals,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   write them down and put them on a paper and just look at them from time to time.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.400]   If you want to take it up a notch, think about the projects, try to break them down into
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.480]   quarterly projects for example.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.080]   If you have a goal of accomplishing something, break it down into the steps that you can
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.480]   accomplish in a quarter, break it down into a month if you can and then those things,
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.360]   make sure they're on your to-do list for each day when you get started working.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.800]   But this really is a great time.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.740]   I get sick and tired of the jokes that people make about New Year's resolutions not working
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.640]   and you're going to see a flood of those articles.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.800]   Making resolutions on things that you don't actually intend to follow through on, yeah,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.920]   it doesn't work.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   But setting goals and creating a plan and then working on that plan until they happen,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   that does work.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.280]   And this is a great time of year to do it.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.000]   Specifically financially, here are just a couple of quick tips for you.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.120]   Financially take a look through your budget.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.800]   Review your transactions for the past year.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.680]   You need to do that for taxes anyway.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.360]   If you haven't done some end of the year looking to see if any final tax transactions that
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.600]   you can make, make sure that you do that before the end of the calendar year.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.240]   Or even if you're not worrying with end of the year tax planning, just sit down and take
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.400]   a look and see.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   Try to review your budget.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.520]   If you don't have detailed records, don't worry.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.200]   Try to look at your credit card statements.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.000]   Many of the credit card companies will itemize your credit card expenditures for you in some
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.640]   kind of way that you can see them in the aggregate.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   If nothing else, sign up an account with personal capital or Mint.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.240]   Use my affiliate link for personal capital at radicalpersonalfinance.com/personalcapital.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.920]   Both of those are totally free.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   But set up an account.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.520]   Enter your accounts and what they will do is they'll auto populate the transactions
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.840]   back a certain amount of time.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.320]   Just take a look.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.460]   Try to get a grasp on what you're spending and see if you're happy with it.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.560]   One thing that you can do is pick one category that you want to work on in the next year
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.300]   and try to see if you can trim some expenses.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.860]   Think through what's the best place for you to focus on first.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.760]   Is your income low?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.540]   I was just this morning working on my budgeting for 2016 and the major goal for me, the major
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.040]   hiccup in my financial plan is not my expenses.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.540]   My expenses are very tight and very low.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:52.240]   The major hiccup for me now in achieving my financial goals going forward is my income.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.540]   For me, 2016 is not about how can I cut expenses.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.920]   I did that this year with getting rid of the house and that brought a lot more certainty.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.560]   Now it'll be time for me to be launching projects and products and things that I can
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.900]   sell to you so that I can increase my income and finishing through on some of the projects
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.460]   that I've already got started.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.160]   So that just simply comes from me sitting down and taking a look at my finances and
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.800]   saying what's really the key.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.100]   So remember the Radical Personal Finance five-part framework.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.780]   These are the only things that you can do to massively affect your results.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.320]   Number one is increase income.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.140]   Number two is decrease expenses.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.900]   Number three, invest wisely.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.020]   Number four, avoid catastrophe.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.760]   And number five, optimize lifestyle.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.700]   So consider those five things and even now if you're driving in the car listening to
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.220]   me, I'll be done in just a couple minutes.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.980]   Flip it off and just have some time in silence and think through that.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.520]   You should be able to remember those five things.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:59.620]   Increase income, decrease expenses, invest wisely, avoid catastrophe and optimize lifestyle
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.300]   and think them through.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.220]   If your income is anemic, if it's just not getting it, then focus there.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.600]   That's usually an area where you can make some wins.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.580]   If your income is just not all that great, think about how you can increase it.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.800]   Is this the year that you want to switch to a new job?
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.940]   Is this the year that you want to start a side business?
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.060]   Is this the year that you want to pick up an extra job just to be able to break free
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.940]   a little bit?
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.860]   Come up with some ideas and just see if you want to follow through on any of them.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.300]   Number two is decrease expenses.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.980]   So do you earn well but you don't have a great handle on the expenses?
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.060]   Well in that case, start building a system.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.980]   Build a system of some kind for yourself.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.200]   Start tracking your money.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.420]   Just go back and listen to the budgeting show.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.500]   I won't repeat it here.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   Number three, invest wisely.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   Let's say that you're in a situation where you have a good income and you have low expenses
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.100]   and you have a good rate of savings.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.060]   Well now the key is going to be for you to focus on your investments.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.980]   It's silly to focus on investments and what rate of return you can get on your 401(k)
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.100]   when you're making $35,000 a year and spending $34,500.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.220]   It doesn't make any difference what rate of return you earn on your 401(k).
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.060]   Your big wins are not in investments.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.180]   But if you're doing well with income and your expenses are substantially below your
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.980]   income, now is the time to look at investments and ask yourself, "Is my investment plan
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.860]   appropriate for me and my lifestyle?"
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.780]   I've shared with you in the past on past shows, this is where I've made dramatic
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.060]   changes and even here at the end of the year I'm making more changes in my own personal
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:42.360]   finances to align my investments and investment accounts with my changing investment philosophy.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.500]   So do you need to do something similar?
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.300]   Number four is avoid catastrophe.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.420]   Think through your risk management plans.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.740]   What are the risks that you're likely to face in the coming year?
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.860]   Do you have people that are depending on your income?
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.500]   Well in that case, make sure that you're properly insured.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.860]   Do you need to get some life insurance?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.580]   Probably the majority of you do.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.380]   If so, make that a goal.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.020]   Get some life insurance and make some calls and here's a great way to kickstart your goals.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:18.560]   Make a couple calls to some insurance offices or insurance agents now and set up an appointment
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.200]   for January.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.700]   Insurance agents, inside knowledge here on the business, the big push for insurance agents
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:30.520]   is always end of the year because what happens is at the end of the year, that's when insurance
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.580]   agencies close their books and so your rankings in the office for your production numbers
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.100]   are always going to come end of the year.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.260]   Unfortunately, insurance agents can't give you a discount.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.980]   It's illegal to rebate commissions and things like that.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.420]   So they can't give you discounts on stuff at the end of the year.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.460]   But insurance agents hustle, hustle, hustle through the end of the year so that they can
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.540]   get good business on the books.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.440]   And then January's are usually very slow.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.220]   So if you know somebody who's in the life insurance business or maybe you need to review
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.140]   your property and casualty business, something like that, make a call and set up an appointment
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.140]   for January.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.220]   They're very happy to hear from you and you'll get lots of time and lots of attention.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.500]   So think through your risk management planning.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.780]   Do you need to check out your homeowner's insurances?
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.660]   Do you need to focus on some emergency funds?
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.020]   Do you need to review your investment allocation?
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:27.060]   So it's my opinion that this next calendar year could be challenging for many of you.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.100]   So do you need to review your investment allocation in the next year?
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.140]   Finally optimize lifestyle.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.100]   This is the blanket statement that goes across everything where you need to consider every
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.240]   aspect of your life and say, "Is this optimal?"
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.400]   And here's the example I always use.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:48.680]   You can earn $50,000 at a job you hate and you can earn $50,000 at a job you love.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:55.000]   The net impact on your financial plan from a $50,000 income is identical.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.700]   But the quality of life, working at a job that is well suited to you versus a job that
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.200]   is poorly suited to you is dramatically different.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.560]   So do you need to optimize your income in some way?
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.180]   Some of you probably need to leave your for-profit job and go work for a not-for-profit.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:19.040]   Some of you probably need to leave your not-for-profit job and go work for a for-profit job.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.800]   Optimize your income.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.140]   Optimize your expenses.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.200]   Frankly, you can spend $1,000 a month on rent in Chicago and you can spend $1,000 a month
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.580]   on rent in Aruba.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.580]   Guess what?
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.560]   The net impact on your financial plan is identical.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.160]   But you know, the lifestyle is very different.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.740]   Some of you need to leave Aruba and move to Chicago.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.820]   Some of you need to leave Chicago and move to Aruba.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.700]   That's not my business to tell you what to do.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:51.100]   I just simply point out to you that even when the net effect on your financial plan is identical,
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.780]   it's not actually identical in terms of quality of life.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.140]   Third, optimize your investments.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.220]   Here's the deal.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:05.280]   You can get rich putting money into publicly traded stocks inside of your company 401(k)
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.140]   and you can also get rich starting a horse farm and training and breeding championship
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.140]   horses.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.140]   Now, is that risky?
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.540]   In fact, the IRS has a special classification for horse farms indicating how risky they
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   are.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:26.740]   My point is, you expand the vision of your investments and invest in a way that's optimal
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.620]   for you and for your lifestyle.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.380]   Some of you are really well suited to working a job for a large corporation, investing money
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.580]   through your 401(k) and mutual funds and going home and forgetting about them at night.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.700]   And some of you would be much more suited by taking money out of your 401(k), signing
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.080]   a lease on a corner store there on Main Street in your town and starting that little business
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.800]   that you're convinced is going to really succeed.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.980]   Some of you are well suited by taking some money from your mutual, your stock account,
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.260]   your mutual fund account and going and buying a camera and starting to take pictures of
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.980]   your friends and building a skill as a photographer or doing videos or expressing some artistic
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.260]   interest.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.060]   Only you are going to know that.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:19.020]   But I'm convinced that if you consider that framework then as an outline for this next
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:25.220]   year then you can coach yourself to make regular meaningful progress and towards your goals.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.260]   I just gave you my best stuff.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.260]   That's what I got.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.200]   If you'd like a more detailed version that framework for wealth, that is the outline
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:42.380]   of the book, that is the core organizational format of what I'm writing, that's my deal.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:48.040]   And I'm convinced it's a great solution for you, a great way of thinking.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.960]   If you'd like more details on that, the video that's a bonus video for patrons of the show
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   has more details and then we'll be doing lots more in this next year.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.400]   And then as soon as I can I'll get the book written and finished so that you all can read
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.280]   it.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.960]   So special thank you as I close here, special thank you to each of you.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.680]   Big thank you to each of you who listens.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.720]   Special thank you to those of you who support the show on Patreon.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.760]   Special thank you to those of you who patronize the sponsors of the show.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.280]   Big thanks to the sponsors.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.400]   I'm excited for this coming year.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.800]   If you'd like to connect with me through the holidays, this will be the last episode of

[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.320]   If you'd like to connect with me through the holidays, connect with me on the social media

[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.040]   I'm going to be spending some time with my family.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.080]   We're going camping for a week here over Christmas and New Year's and we'll be back at it in
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.920]   January, first week of January.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.280]   So Merry Christmas.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:59.720]   I hope that 2015 was a tremendous year for you and may 2016 be a year of incredible growth.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:06.560]   May it be a year that you look back on for the rest of your life with fond memories and
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.600]   just a clear understanding of how great a year it was.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.740]   Life is a gift.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.740]   Life is short.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.240]   I know people that I know died recently and not people that are close to me but I just
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.640]   was thinking about that recently.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   Life is short.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.520]   Take time this holiday season.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   Turn off the phone.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.400]   Turn off the distractions and spend time with those you care about.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.560]   It's a beautiful time of year to do that and I wish you all the best.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.160]   Be back with you in 2016.
