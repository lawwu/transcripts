[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   "Could you tell us why psychedelics can be useful?"
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.880]   And here I'll give the caveats that maybe you'll feel obligated to give as well, but
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.480]   this we're talking about use safely and responsibly, age appropriate, context appropriate, ideally
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.280]   with some clinical or other type of guidance, legality issues obeyed, et cetera.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.440]   All that stated, psychedelics to me are an experience of altered perception, internal
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.320]   and external perception, altered space-time relationship, somewhat dream-like.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.260]   I think it was Alan Hobson at Harvard for a long time talked about the relationship
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.440]   between psychedelic-like states and dream-like states because of this distortion of space-time
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.080]   dimensionality.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.560]   And I haven't experimented with them much.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.560]   I've been part of a clinical trial, three doses of MDMA, which certainly altered the
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.240]   quality of my conscious experience in ways that led to a lot of lasting and at least
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.480]   for me valuable learning.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.680]   So what are your thoughts about psychedelics in terms of how they intersect with the discussion
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.480]   that we've been having and what utility do they play in recognition of the self or in
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.560]   other sorts of brain changes?
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.080]   Well, so yeah, let's just price in all those caveats that people can anticipate.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.040]   These drugs are not without their risks.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.120]   And one problem is that we have this single term drugs or psychedelics, which names many
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.240]   different types of substances, and they're not all the same.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.440]   So like MDMA is not even technically a psychedelic.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.840]   I think it has an immense therapeutic value and it actually was my gateway drug to this
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.920]   whole area of concern.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920]   Amphetamine pathogen, right?
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.720]   It's a sort of an amphetamine and a pathogen at the same time.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   I mean, it's often called-
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   M pathogen, excuse me.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   Not pathogen.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   Not pathogen.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   M pathogen.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.240]   An empathogen or an intactogen, it's been called.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.440]   But it doesn't tend to change perception in the way that classic psychedelics do.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:17.560]   And it's also serotonergic, but it has to be in some part differently so than even LSD
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.520]   and psilocybin, which are much more similar and classic psychedelics, both are also serotonergic,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.880]   but they're not merely so, and they're also different.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.200]   And the higher dose you take of these drugs, the more you...
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.000]   At lower doses, everything can kind of seem the same.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.240]   At higher doses, they begin to diverge.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   And we can talk about the pharmacology if you wanted to, but I would just say that for
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.420]   many of us, I mean, certainly for me, psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning in proving
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:05.040]   to me that a first person interrogation of the mind was worth doing, because I was somebody
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:18.080]   who at age 17 or 18, before I had any real experience with MDMA or LSD or psilocybin,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.240]   if you had taught me how to meditate at that point, I think I would have just bounced off
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   the whole project.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   I think my mind was...
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   I was so cerebral in my engagement with anything.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.200]   I was so skeptical of any of the religious and spiritual traditions that have given us
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.480]   most of our meditation talk, that I think I just would have...
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.560]   I know many of these people, like I have tried to teach Richard Dawkins to meditate and Daniel
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   Dennett to meditate.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.800]   I've ambushed them with meditation and both in a group setting and one-on-one, not Dan,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   but Richard, I ambushed on my own podcast with a guided meditation.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.720]   And he just, from his...
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.560]   He closes his eyes, he looks inside and there's nothing of interest to see.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.440]   He doesn't have the conceptual interest in him that would cause him to persist long enough
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.560]   to find out that there's a there there, right?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.920]   Now, this is not a problem with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.760]   I know that if I gave him a hundred micrograms of LSD or five grams of mushrooms or 25 milligrams
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.840]   of psilocybin, that's probably not the analogous dosage to the five grams of mushrooms.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   Five grams of mushrooms would be more than that.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.440]   I forget what it is of MDMA, maybe 120 milligrams.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.680]   I think the MAPS dose, which is the one that's under clinical trials, is 125 milligrams with
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.640]   an option of a 75 milligram booster.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   Funny I would remember that.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.800]   It's strange, the facts that come to hand.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   But there's just no possibility that nothing's going to happen right now.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.880]   Something with a psychedelic, with MDMA, most people tend to have, certainly under any kind
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.960]   of guidance, tend to have a very positive pro-social experience.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:42.360]   But with a psychedelic, you might have a somewhat terrifying experience if you have, we'll quote,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.360]   a bad trip, and I've certainly had those experiences on LSD and to some degree on psilocybin.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:58.400]   But the prospect that nothing is going to happen is just nearly a million cases out
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.560]   of a million just not in the cards.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   Just neurophysiologically, something's going to happen with the requisite dose of one of
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.040]   these drugs.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:17.360]   And if that thing that happens is psychologically at all normative and pleasant and interesting
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.680]   and valuable, which it is so much of the time, and certainly under the appropriate set and
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.800]   setting and guidance, it can be a lot of the time for virtually everybody.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.560]   Again, there are caveats.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:40.360]   If you're prone, if you think you have a proclivity for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.720]   this is almost certainly not for you.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   And anyone doing the studies at Johns Hopkins for the therapeutic effects of any of these
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:59.080]   drugs, they're ruling out people with first-degree relatives with any of these clinical conditions.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:09.440]   But so for somebody like me at 18 who didn't know that this was an area of not only interest,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.960]   but would it be the center of gravity for the rest of his life if only he could pay
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.200]   attention clearly enough to see that it could be, right?
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.600]   I was someone who very likely-- again, I don't have the counterfactual in hand.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.480]   I don't know what would have happened if someone had forced me to meditate for an hour at that
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   point.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   But I know I wasn't interested in it until I took MDMA.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.040]   I know I wasn't having these kinds of experiences spontaneously that showed me that there was
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.600]   an inner landscape that was worth exploring.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.720]   I was a very hard-headed skeptic who was very interested in lots of things, but there was
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.560]   no alternative to me just thinking more about those things, right?
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:02.480]   I mean, the idea that there's some other way of grasping cognitively at the interesting
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.600]   parts of the world beyond thinking about the world, right, I just-- that just wouldn't
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.640]   have computed for me at all, right?
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.880]   And if you had-- so I just-- and I literally have-- no one ever gave me a book to read
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:23.520]   or a-- I don't-- if you-- the noun "meditation" very likely meant absolutely nothing to me
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.600]   before I took my first dose of-- in this case, it was MDMA.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:38.520]   So what the drug experience did for me is it just proved-- I mean, so one of the limitations
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.120]   of a drug is that, you know, obviously, no matter how good the experience, the drug wears
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.800]   off and then you're back to, you know, more-- in more or less your usual form.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.360]   And now you have a memory of the experience.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.700]   And it can be a fairly dim memory.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.760]   I mean, some of these experiences are so discontinuous with normal waking consciousness
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.360]   that it can be like trying to remember a dream, you know, that just disappears-- it degrades,
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840]   you know, over the course of seconds.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.360]   And then it could have been the most intense dream you've ever had.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.440]   And for whatever reason, you can barely get a purchase on, you know, what it was about.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   And, you know, there's some psychedelic experiences that are analogous to that.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.040]   But for most people, most of the time, there's a residue of this experience.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:29.480]   And with something like MDMA, they can be quite vivid, where you recognize, okay, there
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.120]   was a way of being that is quite different than what I'm tending to access by default.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:47.020]   And it is different in ways that are just, you know, obviously better and psychologically
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   more healthy.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:55.900]   And it's possible to be healthy psychologically in a way that I never imagined, right?
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:02.860]   And then when you link it up to the traditional literature around any of this stuff, again,
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:08.460]   so much of it is shot through with superstition and otherworldliness of religion.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.200]   And, you know, as you know, and I think your listeners probably know, I've spent a lot
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.220]   of time criticizing all that.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.020]   But there is a baby in the bathwater to all of that, right?
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:25.580]   So, I guess it's not that somebody like Jesus or the Buddha or any of the matriarchs and
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:32.020]   patriarchs of the world's religions, it's not that they were all conscious frauds or,
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.580]   you know, temporal lobe epileptics, or like there's a pathological lens that you can put
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.980]   on top of all that.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.940]   But once you have one of these experiences on psychedelics or on a drug like MDMA, you
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.860]   know that there's a there there.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.020]   You know that unconditional love is a possibility, right?
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.980]   You know that feeling truly one with nature, right?
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:03.860]   I mean, just so one with nature that you could spend 10 hours in front of a tree and find
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.180]   that to be the most rewarding experience of your life, right?
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.580]   That's a possible state of consciousness.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.900]   Now, it may not be the state of consciousness you want all the time.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.660]   You know, you don't want to be the crazy guy by the tree, you know, who can't have a conversation
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.020]   about anything else.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.900]   But once you have one of these experiences, you recognize, okay, there's some reason why
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.140]   I'm not having the beatific vision right now.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.140]   And I can't even figure out how to aim my attention so as to have anything like it.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.540]   And that's a problem, right?
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.500]   Because it's available, right?
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   And it's the best, you know, it is among the best things that has ever happened to me,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   right?
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.980]   And now I can just only dimly remember what that was like.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.460]   So how do I get back there on some level?
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:58.020]   And so that invites, again, a logic of changes, a logic of seeking changes in the contents
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:06.820]   of consciousness, which sets someone up for this protracted or seemingly protracted and,
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:14.100]   you know, fairly frustrating search to, you know, game their nervous system so as to have
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.020]   those kinds of experiences more and more.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.900]   And again, it's not that that's in principle fruitless, but it is from the point of view
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.660]   of the kind of the core insight of, you know, the core wisdom of, you know, what I would
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.740]   take from a tradition like Buddhism, which is not, you know, it's not the only tradition
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.860]   that has given voice to this, but I would argue it's given voice to it in the most articulate
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.100]   way.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:45.260]   Again, leaving aside any of the superstition and other worldliness and miracles that, you
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.220]   know, we don't have to talk about at the moment.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.660]   And you certainly don't need to endorse in order to be interested in this stuff.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:02.360]   And so that's the bifurcation between all of the utility of psychedelics and what I'm
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:09.420]   talking about under the rubric of meditation is at this point of, okay, once you realize
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.580]   there's a there there, what do you do and what's the logic by which you're led to do
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.580]   it?
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:20.480]   And I think it's possible if your only framework is the good experiences, the good feels you
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:31.180]   had on whatever drug it was, and a further discussion of like what that path of changes,
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.820]   you know, can look like, and that can come in a religious context, it can come in just
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:42.140]   a purely psychedelic context, or, you know, some combination of the two.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.820]   I think you can be misled to, you can just be, you can be misled to just seek lots of
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   peak experiences.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.340]   You're just trying to string together a lot of peak experiences, hoping they're going
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.740]   to change you.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.540]   Every one of which by definition is going to be impermanent, right?
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.100]   I mean, it's first it wasn't there, then it's there, and then it's no longer there.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.420]   And then you've got a memory of it, right?
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.760]   What I think it's, what everyone really wants, whether they know it or not, and they're right
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:18.780]   to want, is a type of freedom that is compatible with even ordinary states of consciousness,
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.460]   which can ride along with them into extraordinary states of consciousness.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.500]   I mean, so what I hadn't done psychedelics for 25 years, because I mean, again, they
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.220]   were super useful for me in the beginning, then I discovered meditation on the basis
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:39.780]   of those experiences, got really into meditation and realized, okay, this is a much more, this
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.380]   really is, conceptually, this makes much more sense to me.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:49.760]   This is delivering the goods in terms of my experience.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.340]   There's no need to keep having these, seeking these peak experiences with drugs.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.760]   But it had been 25 years since I had done that and there was this resurgence in research
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   on psychedelics.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.100]   And I was being asked about psychedelics and I was talking about their utility for me,
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.500]   but again, these were distant memories.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.340]   And so I, and there was also one type of psychedelic experience I was aware that I had never had.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.500]   I had never done a high dose of mushrooms blindfolded, you know, like every mushroom
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.740]   trip I'd ever had, I'd been out in nature and interacting with, you know, it was just
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.540]   been a very transformed sensory experience of the world and of other people, but I'd
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.580]   never done it alone, blindfolded, just purely, you know, inwardly directed and at a high
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.580]   dosage.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:40.780]   I'd done high doses of LSD, but not mushrooms.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.020]   So I did that, you know, and it was very useful.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.900]   And I spoke about it on my podcast and there's actually this, I think if you search Sam Harris
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:54.900]   mushroom trip on YouTube, you get the 19 minute version of that, my describing that trip.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:02.300]   It was incredibly useful and, but what was doubly useful was my mindfulness training
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.820]   in the context of that explosion of synesthesia.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:12.080]   I mean, it was, it was, it was such an overwhelmingly strong experience.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:20.140]   And there were so many moments where it could have gone one way or the other based on my
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.740]   sense of just, okay, I'm going to try to resist this.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.780]   You know, it was like, it was, it was, it was in truth, irresistible because it was
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:34.460]   just so much, but there were moments where I was aware of, okay, this is like letting
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:44.140]   go of self, you know, in this context is, is the thing that is going to, you know, make
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.220]   the difference between heaven and hell here, you know, and because there's, there are experiences
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.820]   that are so extreme that you can't even tell if it's agony or ecstasy.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.100]   It's just, it's just, it's everything has turned up to 11, right?
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.780]   And the difference between the two is like, you know, the tipping point is just, it's
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.420]   on, it really is kind of a high wire act in some sense, you know, you could just fall
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.860]   to one side or the other.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:16.860]   And yeah, so what I think people want is they certainly want to be able to extract from
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:22.220]   the psychedelic experience, wisdom that is applicable to ordinary states of consciousness.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.940]   It's like, what is the thing you can realize in a moment of having a conversation with
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.940]   your child that isn't distracting you from that relationship?
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.120]   It's not a memory of when the world dissolved or, you know, when you were indistinguishable
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:44.300]   from the sky, but it's just a way of, a way of having free attention and unconditional
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:53.080]   love in this, you know, totally ordinary and potentially chaotic human experience, you
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.340]   know, which can be psychologically fraught and you can meet, you know, iterations of
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.320]   yourself that you don't like, that are, that are not equipping you to be the best possible
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.100]   person in that relationship.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:12.180]   And what we want to do is cut through all of that and actually, you know, be in love
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.460]   with our lives and with the people in our lives more and more of the time.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:23.840]   And that's, there's, I'm not saying that's the psych, you know, that repeated psychedelic
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.940]   journeys aren't, can't be integral to that project, but, but you know that it can't,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.300]   the project can't be being high all the time, right?
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.100]   So whatever is extractable from that, the, the, the occasional, you know, psychedelic
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.660]   trip has got to be mappable into ordinary waking consciousness.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.660]   And the point of con, the real point of contact does kind of run through this, you know, what
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.900]   I've been calling the illusion of the self.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:56.180]   And again, it is, that part is discoverable without any changes in contents, right?
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.900]   So you don't have to suddenly feel the energy of your body be rush out and be continuous
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.980]   with the, you know, the ocean of energy that is not your body, right?
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.180]   Like that's an experience that's there to be had, right?
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:15.900]   I mean, it's, there's no doubt, but this, the truth is, I mean, just looking at this
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:23.100]   cup is just as formless and as mysterious as that, right?
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.420]   When it's seen in the right way.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:37.900]   And that's, and that's, that's what, you know, meditation encourages, you know, one to recognize.
