[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Everyone will tell you they lost money, even with a big sample set.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.480]   If I look at the news, there's front pages saying more layoffs, bankruptcies,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.960]   and that actually may be the best time to invest.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.080]   How do I even think about why I should invest and how to invest?
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.840]   How would you start that conversation with them?
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240]   A lot of it comes from what that person already knows about the markets, investing,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.760]   trying to understand where they are. There are a few quite important decisions you need to make.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.600]   There's the kind of risk you want to take on and the risks your financial
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.360]   situation will allow you to take on. When thinking about these types of questions,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.960]   what is the maximum value going to tell you? And then there's, what should you actually do?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.960]   If you don't want to be exposed to idiosyncratic things that happen in a country,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.600]   you can diversify and say, "I'm going to invest some in the U.S.,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.520]   I'm going to invest some in Europe, I'm going to invest some in Asia."
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.640]   It's certainly true that there's that opportunity for additional optimization.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.240]   It's like, because things are taxed differently, then there's opportunity to optimize that.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.240]   There was a study by this group of economists. They wrote this book called Triumph of the
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.320]   Optimists. They did this huge study over 20 countries and they found...
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.680]   Chris, thanks for being here.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.480]   Thanks for having me in this lovely home studio you've built.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.200]   Yeah. So we go way back. And the reason I wanted to have you join me today
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.440]   is because we get so many questions from people that are so confused about the process of investing.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.640]   And I go back in time and think, "Gosh, when I had a lot of friends ask me how to invest,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.520]   I would call you all the time." And that led to us starting a company together to
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.160]   help people figure out what to do with their money and invest.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.640]   And so who better to join me for a conversation about how people should think about building
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.960]   their investment portfolio than the person that I called all the time and started a company with.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.680]   So that's the goal is helping people understand how to think about their investment portfolio.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.040]   And we did this a lot at Grove. And I'm curious if you were sitting in a meeting with a client
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.680]   and they said, "How do I even think about why I should invest and how to invest?"
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   How would you start that conversation with them?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.720]   I think a lot of it comes from what that person already knows about the markets,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   investing, trying to understand where they are. But I think there are a few quite important
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.560]   decisions you need to make when you're thinking about building a portfolio.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.720]   There's the risk you want to take on and the risks your financial situation will allow you to take
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:38.960]   on. And then there's given that risk, what's the mix of investments that make sense to achieve your
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.800]   goals? Back up for one second and say, "The reason anyone should even do this is that their money
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   wants to keep up with inflation." Is that the premise of why even invest your money in the
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.200]   first place? Well, I think most people want to invest their money to reach to spend it in the
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   future. So I think beating inflation is a great goal. But I think people want to go beyond that
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   and try to get as much out as they can. And the question is, well, how do you do that? What
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.120]   investments do you need to do that? Yeah. And the reason why you wouldn't just
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.440]   invest it in the riskiest thing in the world, as you said, is risk is very important. How much you
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.000]   can and are comfortable taking. And there are lots of questionnaires online to answer those things.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.280]   And so I'd say someone could go get a risk score. One of the things that I think we noticed when we
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.360]   were talking with clients was people are a little bit maybe more optimistic about their own tolerance
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.400]   for risk than might actually happen. And depending on whether you've ever invested in the stock
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.600]   market or some investment that went down, the typical question is like, "If the market goes down
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.720]   30%, what do you do? Do you buy more? Do you sell? Do you freak out?" Do you feel like those
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.200]   questions actually can gauge someone's risk? Yeah. I'm skeptical of the online risk scores.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.480]   Some of them ask questions about what would you do if it was down 30%. Some of them ask questions,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   which are even worse, which are how much would you be willing to pay for a coin flip bet or
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.240]   something like that. They're trying to get at some fundamental characteristic of the person,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.960]   but I think that's oversimplifies it. So I think you can try to take those questionnaires and see
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.360]   what they say as a general guide. But I think one of the exercises that we did with clients at Grove,
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.760]   which I think is the most helpful, is to really try to imagine yourself in your current situation
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:48.080]   with your brokerage account, with your retirement portfolio. And if the equity market were to go
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:57.360]   down 20%, 30%, 40%, how would you react? And is there a percentage loss or dollar loss that you
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.760]   say, "This would be extremely uncomfortable for me"? So I think playing out a scenario could
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   actually be a really helpful way to understand what your risk tolerance is at this point for you.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.880]   And I think not everyone that's an investor today was an investor four years ago. But I think you
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.560]   could ask yourself four years ago during the middle of the pandemic, when a lot of portfolios dropped,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.920]   "How did you feel then?" These kind of major market corrections don't always happen
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.440]   so frequently that the average investor even sees multiple of them.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.320]   In the last four years, we saw one. And yes, the recovery was quite quick, but I had friends that
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.400]   after a 20% loss were like, "I'm out." And then I had people that wrote it all the way to the bottom
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.360]   and wrote it all the way back up to the top and beyond. And so we have one data point that if you
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.920]   were an investor four years ago, you could maybe say, "How did I feel?" Yeah, I think that's really
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:00.640]   helpful. But as you point out, the recent drops have been pretty shallow and pretty quick recovery.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.040]   It's helpful to look a little further back in history and say, "Okay, well, can you put yourself
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.480]   in the mind of if the drop had been 50% and was there for a little bit and the economic news was
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   consistently bad for a long time, like it was in the 2008, 2009, where you had a lot of investors
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.840]   say, "What am I doing? I'm going to take a step back and sell." And I think from the trough over
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.480]   the next year, the market was up 65% or something. And I think a lot of people missed out on that.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   Yeah. And so the reason why this is important is because you want a portfolio that you're not
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.920]   going to sell out of when it's down, because if you do, you will often miss out on the ride back
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.480]   to the top. Yeah. I think that's one of the major mistakes that retail investors make.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.760]   And it's a very easy mistake to make because all these signals are negative. And the market is a
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.680]   very different type of system than the ones we're used to dealing with. If you want a good restaurant
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.480]   to go to, then you need to ask your friends, "Hey, what was your experience at this restaurant?" If
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.640]   all your friends said they had a great experience or a terrible experience, that's a really good
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:25.840]   indication of how your experience will be. A different type of system that's maybe, if you're
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.880]   trying to buy a reliable car, you may ask your friends who have a similar car if their car breaks
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.640]   down, but it probably doesn't. But is that a signal that it's going to be a reliable car for you?
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.840]   Maybe, but you probably need a bigger sample set, right?
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.480]   You got to turn to Consumer Reports. Right. You go to the Consumer Reports,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.960]   the reliability survey where they survey thousands of people. But for the market,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   either of those strategies in these downturns would not be a good one, right? Everyone will
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.960]   tell you they lost money, even with a big sample set. So you say, "Okay, well,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:07.520]   not only have all my friends lost money, if I look at the news, the front page is saying
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.840]   more layoffs, bankruptcies. And that actually may be the best time to invest."
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.400]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you invested all of your money at the bottom of the crash in '08 or the
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.720]   bottom of the crash, that would be great. But I think we could probably talk about it a little
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.400]   later. Waiting for that bottom might not actually be as good a strategy as just being invested now.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.240]   I did an interview with a guy named Nick Majulie, who wrote a book that I believe
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.960]   is just "Just Keep Buying." And his argument was like, "Don't stop and wait. Just keep buying."
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.320]   We won't go down that path yet. So okay. So when we think about constructing a portfolio,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   I think before you start, you need to think about your risk and how much you can tolerate,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.600]   because that's going to come into play. And how much you can emotionally tolerate and actually
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.920]   financially. If all the money you have is in the market, and you need it for lots of things
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.480]   in your life, you might be comfortable with a 50% drop, but you might not be able to financially
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.440]   afford it. So that's this other component that I think is often missed is can your financial
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.160]   situation tolerate? Yeah. And I think a lot of that is a function of what money do you need in
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.320]   the near future. If you're planning on buying a house in two months, then you probably shouldn't
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.480]   have that all in the equity market, because the market could easily drop and you could lose money
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.360]   and not be able to buy the house. So that affects your capacity to take risks, we would call it.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.080]   Yeah. Okay. So now I've kind of understood, hopefully a little bit about my own personality,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.840]   my own capacity and tolerance. But we actually have to build a portfolio. And so there are
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   a seemingly unlimited number of things you can invest in. And I'm going to assume that most
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.640]   people here are looking to grow their money over time and beat inflation and earn more than just
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.160]   leaving their money in a bank account. How do you even begin to think about how to construct the
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:14.720]   portfolio? Yeah. So I think one principle would be diversification. And there's a lot of reasons
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.520]   for diversification. One is that you don't want necessarily a portfolio that's going to do well
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.280]   only in one set of conditions, because it's very hard to know what the future holds, right?
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.760]   So we think about asset class diversification as being important so that the portfolio can do well
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:42.000]   both in periods of high economic growth, and it doesn't totally fall apart in low economic growth,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.240]   that it can withstand periods of high inflation and low inflation. So different asset classes
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.600]   can do well in different circumstances, right? So like stocks, in periods of high economic growth,
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.640]   stocks can do well. Low economic growth, you have government bonds can perform better.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.520]   Periods of high inflation, you have TIPS, which are inflation-indexed government bonds.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.240]   Those can do well, and also commodities, and in some circumstances, real estate.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.800]   Yeah. So you're thinking about having a mix of asset classes that can benefit you a lot.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.680]   And is it just asset classes, or is it geographies, size of the companies in those
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.280]   asset classes? How far can you go down the diversification path, and can you go too far?
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:36.480]   Yeah. So going further down the diversification, there are kind of two other axes I would think
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:45.680]   about the diversification. One is across geographies. If you don't want to be exposed to
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.400]   idiosyncratic things that happen in a country, you can diversify and say, "I'm going to invest
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.040]   some in the US, I'm going to invest some in Europe, and invest some in Asia."
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.760]   And you can also think about diversifying within a geography across companies. So
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:10.960]   you may not want to say, "Oh, I'm going to put all my money into one company in the US or in
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:21.120]   each country." There's benefits in owning a lot of different companies so that you're not exposed to.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.920]   What if there's fraud or something that happened, or the company has a product that becomes less
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.480]   competitive? So yeah, I think there are benefits on those two axes too.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.960]   Okay. So I think it's pretty agreed by most people that you want to diversify your portfolio.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.600]   You want to diversify it, like you said, across asset classes, across geographies.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.400]   How do you actually figure out what it is? So I'm thinking there's the old school portfolio,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.520]   which is just like 60/40 stocks and bonds. Then you can go online and search these lazy
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.160]   portfolios and it's like, "Well, here's if you wanted three index funds, or four, or five."
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:05.200]   And you could build a portfolio of 50 index funds. Is there a principle or a guideline of how you
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.600]   find something that's going to do well for you, but isn't so complicated that you're either not
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.240]   getting any benefit for the level of work you're doing, or it's just too complicated that doesn't
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:23.120]   actually, you can't maintain it? Even with a simple two-fund, three-fund portfolio,
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.600]   there is a huge amount of diversification in that. If you look at some of these
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:37.520]   index funds, they have 3000 companies inside. If you're trying to think about all of these
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.840]   aspects to diversify upon, different types of companies, different geographies,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.160]   different types of asset classes, at the end of the day, you have to pick something to put
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.840]   your money into. And you could go as far as you want and have all these asset classes.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.280]   And we had a conversation years ago where it was like, "Well, if you want to add some China,
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.640]   but you want small cap and large cap China, and now all of a sudden you could build a portfolio
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.320]   with a lot of things." Or there are people out there who say, "You could just buy VTI,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:10.240]   the total stock market, and then just call it a day." And you might miss out on international
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.960]   there. You might miss out on bonds, but that is unapproached. How do you think you find
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:21.040]   the place on that spectrum that makes sense? Yeah. So I think if you have your list of
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.440]   ways that you'd like to diversify your asset classes and geographies you'd like to hit,
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:35.040]   I would say almost the simpler, the better. If you can achieve all the ways you'd like to
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.880]   diversify with fewer funds, that's why I think the three fund portfolio is very popular in that
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:49.760]   people have their... A three fund portfolio can get you diversification across asset classes
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:57.200]   because it has bonds and domestic stocks and international stocks. And you get geographic
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.800]   diversification because it invests across a lot of countries and you get the company diversification.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.960]   So I think the three fund portfolio is a great place to start because it seems to check all the
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:11.440]   boxes. I think if you wanted to go further and say, "Well, I'm actually concerned that
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:20.800]   this is not going to be... There's not enough exposure to assets that will do well in an
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.360]   inflationary environment." For example, it may not include things that are particularly exposed
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.040]   to commodities. It may not have enough real estate for your taste. It may not have enough
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:38.240]   inflation-indexed treasuries. Then you would look at expanding the set of
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.960]   funds that you need to include. Now, I'm imagining people might be
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.560]   thinking like I am right now, which is, "Well, I don't know. Do I need more inflationary protection
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.680]   in my portfolio? Do I need to have more real estate? Do I need..." I actually, even for myself,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.600]   struggle with this. In a way, I would say over the years, I've done everything from three-fund
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.440]   to 12-fund to put money in an online investment advisor that you just give a risk score and they
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.880]   build the portfolio to then tweaking that portfolio. And I've never left feeling like,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   "I know this is the perfect portfolio for me because I don't know if my international exposure
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.920]   should be 40% or 30% or whether 40% or 30% even matters. I know I should have some."
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.360]   How do you even know which asset classes you might want to include?
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:37.040]   I think a lot of smart people disagree about this. I think if you surveyed recommended
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.840]   portfolios from professional investors, you could look at portfolios recommended by
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:48.320]   David Swenson, who's the former CIO of the Yale Endowment, or if you look at robo-advisors,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   Wealthfront, Betterment, they all, I think, have reasonable methodologies that get you to...
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:04.320]   You're checking the boxes, but there's different implementations of the things that check the
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.920]   boxes. And a lot of the difference comes from assumptions, beliefs of the person
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.520]   constructing the portfolio and different assumptions that go into the... about what
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:20.960]   the future will hold. Okay. So you could start as a baseline, go search for lazy portfolios,
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.280]   and there's this great Bogleheads wiki page with a bunch of options from three to six.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.200]   You could go to Wealthfront or Betterment or any other online advisor and just say,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.120]   "Here's my risk score. What portfolio do they give me?"
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   At the end of the day, from a return standpoint, is there even going to be that much difference
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:43.120]   between, "Oh, well, one of them says 40% here and 60% here. One of them says 38 and 62."
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.360]   Should we even get caught up in these on-the-margin, single-digit changes to different
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.200]   allocations? Or is it kind of all who knows what the exact outcome will be, and they're all going
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.960]   to correlate with each other pretty well? Well, I think there are two parts to that
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:08.080]   question. This incremental changes to... If you're talking about, "Are you going to be 60%
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.680]   bonds or 60% stocks or 59% stocks?" That's not going to really matter.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.560]   I think you do... If you look at the lazy portfolios, you'll see different...
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.040]   You'll see meaningfully different asset allocations. That will produce different
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:37.120]   returns. These things will not perform exactly the same. I think the problem that I don't know,
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:44.320]   no one knows, is what's going to do better. I think they all... I think that's the really hard
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:51.360]   question. What you could do is look at the rationale behind them and see which one makes
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:58.320]   the most sense to you. But yeah, I'm not going to say they're going to perform the same, but
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.560]   it's really hard to tell beforehand which one's going to be better. And you can have multiple
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:12.640]   reasonable approaches that you could decide from. What would the very sophisticated professional
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.920]   investor be doing that maybe isn't something we want to emulate, but might help us understand
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:25.680]   how anyone could come to the conclusion that 59 and 20 and 21, whatever combo of things,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.920]   is actually correct? Yeah. Where do the numbers come from that a lot of these people will come up
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:40.000]   with? An approach that a lot of investors can use when building a portfolio is that they have some
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:52.480]   selection of assets and that from those assets, you can assign an expected return and you can
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.360]   try to predict what you think the average return is going to be of those assets over whatever time
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.240]   period you're looking at and what you think the correlation between returns are. And these are
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.280]   numbers that are hard to come up with. What's your expected equity returns? Again, a lot of smart
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.640]   people disagree about that. What's the correlation of equities going to be with bonds and real
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.080]   estate and commodities? Also very hard to predict. You can look at history, but correlations change
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:27.120]   over time just like returns do. So you can take this, then you can add further constraints on
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.040]   about, "Well, I don't want to have more than this type of exposure in this asset. I don't want to
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.560]   have more than this type of exposure in this asset." You can add complicated constraints.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.000]   And then you put it through a big optimization algorithm where you ask the computer to say,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.080]   "Okay, given a certain amount of risk that I'm willing to take or a certain potential loss that
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.720]   I can tolerate, what is the best combination?" So you can have an algorithm come up with that.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.040]   Now, there's a long process of coming up with those expected returns, coming up with the
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:06.000]   correlations, putting the constraints on, building the optimization to solve it that
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.320]   get you those numbers. But that's a process a lot of professionals do follow.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.200]   - Yeah. It seems complicated for someone like me to go build an optimization engine
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.840]   to do all of this. And at the end of the day, I'd probably be borrowing someone else's work
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.000]   on correlations and returns, which I could probably just borrow their assumption. If
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.560]   I'm going to use all of their assumptions for things, then optimizing that to the right portfolio
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.080]   is probably going to be easier to just say, "Well, what did they optimize to if I'm going to use all
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:40.080]   of their assumptions?" I think almost all of the portfolios out there that I've seen have some mix
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:48.880]   between equities and bonds and maybe some international. And so I think you're probably
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.760]   going to end up with a portfolio there. The things that there's probably more disagreement on is
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.000]   some have international and some break it out into developed and emerging market.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.560]   Why break it out? Is it because the general international buckets of index funds you would
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:11.280]   buy just don't have the right balance? Or why do a lot of people add on this emerging market
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.880]   category to their portfolio? - So I guess, assuming we're talking
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.280]   about an international fund that includes some emerging market in it, the reason to break it out
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:29.680]   is, I guess, there are at least two reasons. One is that you may disagree with the total allocation
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:38.240]   to it. So you want to make it either higher or lower. Another is it gives you the opportunity to
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:47.760]   kind of rebalance in that if you say, "Okay, I want emerging markets to be 10% of my portfolio,"
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:56.480]   or whatever, then if emerging markets underperforms, then it may stay lower if it's
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:05.280]   indexed. Whereas if you had it broken out, you would potentially buy more and bring it back up
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:15.760]   to 10% of the portfolio. But again, the reason to do that, you need some type of opinion about
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.480]   whether you want more or less emerging markets in there.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.880]   - Yeah. And I hear a lot of people say, "Okay, well, I live in the United States.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:30.640]   If I buy a home and the US market is down, my home's going to be cheaper." Is the argument
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.560]   to include international because you want to do well even in a case when the American stock market
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.960]   does poorly? Or is there some other argument to being more globally diversified?
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:51.760]   - I think that's the primary one where you may not want your wealth only linked
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:24:00.560]   to the performance of the US stock market and that there are going to be years where
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:08.480]   the rest of the stock markets on average will do better than the US stock market.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.440]   So to the extent you have that, then your portfolio as a whole will be less volatile.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:20.560]   So that could potentially allow you to have a higher percentage of your assets in equities
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.000]   and get you to the same risk level.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.440]   - Yeah, I think that's a really important point that I want to undermine. So
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.400]   by having more of your portfolio in equities, which have a typically higher return than
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.040]   fixed income bond, typically, historically at least, but you're taking on more risk.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.120]   But if you diversify within that equities to say, "Well, in case the US stock market goes down,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.880]   I can have a little bit of international in there, balance it out. It lets me take more
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.840]   overall risk in the portfolio." And so the, I guess the-
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.120]   - Or the same overall risk, but with more equities. A higher percentage of equities, yeah.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:03.760]   - Okay. So we've got equities, we've got fixed income. We'll come back to,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.880]   what are some of these other asset classes that you see on some portfolios and not?
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:14.320]   Maybe we'll talk first about real estate. Like someone listening might say, "Well,
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.840]   I already own a home, so I already have real estate exposure." What is the case for or against
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.080]   including real estate as part of your investment portfolio for someone who is not a professional
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.440]   real estate investor buying rental properties and commercial real estate and all that?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.040]   - Yeah, so I guess the question is,
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:41.760]   including real estate in the portfolio being like buying REITs, so buying these publicly-
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.000]   - Yes, sorry.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.920]   - Traded real estate trusts. And I guess one perspective on it is like, "Well, REITs are
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.040]   already in the S&P or sorry, these index funds to some extent." So there's a small amount of
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.240]   exposure that you're getting to these REITs already. And then there's a saying, "Well,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.920]   do you want more than the default amount in the index fund?" And
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:14.160]   I think there's some historical evidence that the value of real estate moves differently than the
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:26.320]   value of the stock market. So you're potentially introducing more diversification into your
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:34.640]   portfolio, which again, allows you to potentially have a higher percentage of risky assets while
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.480]   keeping the same amount of total risk in the portfolio. And because of that, you expect
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:46.000]   that owning real estate is different than owning equity in a company.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.240]   You'd expect it to perform well in different economic environments also.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.320]   - Yeah, so I mean, 2008 is probably not the right example, but there were probably periods-
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   - Yeah, not 2008.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.640]   - But there were probably periods of time where real estate is doing well,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.960]   the stock market is not doing well, and that would be a reason to dial it up. But an important thing,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.880]   I think, to keep in mind is, okay, so you already have some exposure to real estate
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:15.600]   in your index funds. And the same thing is probably true, maybe not, about commodities?
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.040]   - So commodity-producing companies, yeah. Yeah, like Exxon and then miners, yeah.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   - So you probably have exposure to the commodity market maybe indirectly,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.320]   but I've seen a lot of people talking about recently, energy has done well.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:38.880]   Is there a case to put those commodities in your portfolio, the actual commodities? I'm sure,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.920]   I think there are index funds that you can invest in energy or in timber or agriculture.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.440]   Is there a reason to or not to add that on? Because I don't see it too often in most of
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.040]   the lazy portfolios, but I hear people talking about it.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:04.880]   - Mm-hmm. So I think owning commodities themselves is challenging, right? You don't
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:12.000]   actually want to own a bunch of wood or oil. So the way that people can do this are through
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:23.040]   some of these funds that can trade commodity futures. And I think there's an argument among
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:30.400]   investors are like, "Well, what are you actually getting with commodity futures? How direct is that
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:39.440]   exposure to the underlying price of the commodity?" But I think there's some pass-through,
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.720]   it's not nothing. So I think one is the kind of the directness of the exposure.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:52.160]   Another concern is of the management fees of some of these funds. So I think that would be worth
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:29:00.240]   taking a hard look at if they're charging 1% or more to manage this trading strategy of commodities
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.160]   futures, then that's something to be aware of that. It may give you additional diversification
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.680]   and that the commodities futures aren't going to behave the same as the rest of the assets
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.560]   of the portfolio, but you may pay for that in terms of management fees.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   - Yeah. Which I think is a overarching important theme, which is as you're picking ways to invest
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.960]   in various assets, there are a lot of ways to do it. If you want to invest in the stock market,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.920]   you could invest in an actively managed index fund or mutual fund, you can invest in a passive one.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.760]   What do you look for when you're trying to pick a way to invest in an asset class?
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:43.600]   - I think the two main ways are, what's a good index to track and try to find
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:51.840]   an asset that can track that index. If you're looking for the S&P 500, look for something that
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:59.440]   is tracking that. If you're looking for the, or maybe better the kind of the overall equity,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.560]   the US equity market, look for funds that track the thing you're looking for. Then second is
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:16.800]   the fee that they charge on the management of the fund. You'll see this varies a huge amount.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.240]   I mean, Vanguard has done an amazing job of offering these exceptionally low fees
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:33.520]   on a lot of index funds. I think those two things are basically what I would look for.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.960]   - When you find these funds that, my buddy in college is in this fund and he says, "It's great.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.080]   There's a great fund manager." You look at it and you're like, "Well, this fund is investing
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:51.760]   in the US stock market. It's got a 1.5% expense ratio." VTI, the Vanguard total stock market fund,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.200]   I don't know what it is now, but it's probably like 0.03, 0.05, some minuscule amount.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.320]   Is there any argument to be looking at these funds that are much more expensive,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.520]   but managed by what I'm sure they would tell you are really smart investors that are making
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:16.320]   decisions that are supposed to outperform? - Yeah. This is an important distinction between
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.400]   these passively managed index funds, which their only goal is to track a defined index.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:36.800]   Versus the active funds are frequently have an index that they're compared with,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.720]   but they're trying to make investment decisions based on their analysis of companies or
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:51.600]   assets that are going to return more than others. They're trying to use some investment process to
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:57.360]   beat the index. They try to beat the index, but they also have to pay their managers to
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:04.160]   try to do that. They end up costing significantly more, a lot of times in the order of 1% or more.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:15.760]   I think a helpful framing of that challenge is like, okay, well, it doesn't sound unreasonable
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.480]   that you put a bunch of smart people in a room and have them pick stocks and they're going to
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.840]   do better than the market. It doesn't sound unreasonable. But I think a framing that makes
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.400]   it harder is that, well, if you bucket all the people trying to beat the market together,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.120]   and you call them the active investors, on average, they're going to have the same
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.880]   performance as the market. So that means there are going to be winners and losers to that.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:48.320]   So you say, okay, well, maybe I can pick a fund in the winner half.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   Maybe, but all of those funds will also charge a management fee. So the question is,
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.240]   can you pick one that will win enough to overcome the 1% management fee? Because on average,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.720]   they're not going to outperform because they have this management fee on top of it.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.320]   Yeah, I remember looking and seeing this data. And it wasn't that people don't beat the market.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.160]   They do all the time. It was that the person who beats the market in one year
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.480]   doesn't usually beat the market every other year. And so, it especially can be hard to pick
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.000]   someone. It's like, oh, they beat the market last year. Could be the worst indicator of whether
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.680]   they beat the market next year or not. And so, I think the data, and I don't know the exact stats,
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.480]   I will find an article, I'll link to it in the show notes. But the data is that net of fees,
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.320]   active investors don't beat the market. Would that be fair? In general, or even the average one?
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.080]   Net of fees. Yeah.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.560]   Net of fees.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.200]   I think that's probably true. Yeah.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:59.200]   So, all of what, at least I'm investing in, is the only active management is anything that I'm
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:05.040]   doing myself, which is usually not beating the market. So, I've proven this point on myself.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.800]   How do you think about newer assets like crypto fitting into a portfolio?
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:19.440]   I think with newer assets... So, let me take a step back and say, why do we have the confidence
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:25.280]   to include equities or something in the portfolio at all? And I think there are a few reasons that
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.600]   people feel comfortable with equities. A few reasons that people feel comfortable with equities.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:40.240]   One is that there is a long historical record of them doing well. And it's not just,
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:48.000]   oh, in the US over the last 40 years, it's had a good return. It's that over... There was a study
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.440]   by this group of economists. They wrote this book called Triumph of the Optimists. And they did this
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.200]   huge study over 20 countries, over a hundred years of history. And they found
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:09.600]   over the hundred years, on average, global equities beat the market, but beat inflation
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   by 5%. And some countries did better. The US, I think, was closer to six and a half percent
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:23.360]   overinflation over the hundred-year period they looked at. And some countries did worse.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:31.280]   Even ones that faced a lot of hardship over that period, Germany, Japan,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:40.400]   they had inflation war that caused a lot of destruction. And they still beat the market,
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:47.040]   or beat inflation by 3% over that period. So it's this kind of longstanding, consistent
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.720]   performance of history is one thing that makes it comfortable, people comfortable with it.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:36:01.120]   Second is that you're getting ownership in a big, global, a lot of times profitable
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:11.360]   company when you buy a stock, or a group of them if you're buying an index. And that means you own
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.800]   a part of Apple, and Visa, and Johnson & Johnson, each of which has thousands of people trying to
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.960]   make new products, trying to be more efficient, make more money next year. And all the money they
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.640]   earn, they're going to reinvest in the business or distribute it to you. And a lot of these have
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:32.720]   big dividends they pay out every quarter. So you own something that is making money,
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.000]   and it has a long history of success. And so when you think about developing a long-term
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.960]   investment strategy, that's the type of thing that I would look to include. And you have an
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.200]   understanding of equities, and government bonds, and real estate, and these things you can get a
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:55.280]   handle around. When you think about including crypto in that strategy...
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.520]   - It's kind of missing both of them.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:06.560]   - It's missing both the history and the unclear use of it.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:12.960]   - It's certainly not an income-producing thing. You can't take it. I mean, sure,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:20.400]   there are ways to stake it and earn income and all that, but it's effectively just a speculation
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:28.320]   that the reason it would go up is because people think it's more valuable, not because it tripled
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.840]   its revenue, built a new iPhone, those kinds of things, reasons that Apple stock might go up.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.600]   It's going up because people think it's worth more because there's a limited supply of it,
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:44.560]   and more people want it, which is much more of a speculative bet than a kind of fundamental bet.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.760]   - Yeah. I mean, to me, it's closer to a commodity that within maybe an unclear kind of
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:38:01.600]   total use of, or a currency, where there are reasons you don't include those directly in an
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.760]   investment portfolio traditionally. - Yeah. What about other alternative
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.560]   things? I want to invest in a friend of mine's company. I want to invest in a winery. I want
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.800]   to buy some art. Do those things fit in your investment portfolio?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:26.720]   - I think it depends a lot on kind of what the purpose is. I think if you want to own a winery
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.640]   and/or art, there's probably a lot of value that you'll personally accrue from it other than the
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:40.800]   money. I imagine a winery, or a winery at least, it could be a very different approach of whether
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.120]   you're trying to run a winery to create a few bottles of wine for you and your friends, or
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.840]   as like a huge business venture that you're going to expect to make a lot of money on.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.680]   - There are a lot of other ways people can invest their money, and there's a lot of platforms online
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.080]   that make it easier to buy art, to buy shares in private companies, to buy sneaker collections.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:06.560]   I don't mean that you would own things that you can own a piece of as an investment. Those aren't
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.160]   things that necessarily have index funds. Those aren't things that you would traditionally see
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.360]   in an investment portfolio. But I think a lot of people that invest in companies and startups
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.720]   think of it as an investment. Do you think of that as something inside your investment portfolio,
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.400]   or do you like to carve a piece of your assets that you want to invest out, set them separately,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:32.560]   and not call them part of your portfolio? - I would recommend thinking about them as
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:39.680]   different things. It's helpful to have a liquid investment portfolio with a defined strategy
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:47.520]   that you can manage. Then I think to the extent that you want to be involved with more speculative
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:58.000]   things with a much less clear risk and return profile than a traditional investment portfolio,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.400]   it could be helpful to assign a pool of money that you're going to spend toward those things.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:10.320]   - Yeah. I think I've often heard people say anywhere from 5% to 10% should be your cap.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:16.000]   We're not going to tell people what they should do on this episode. This is not investment advice.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.480]   It's a conversation. But when you think about these alternatives, I think the interesting thing
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.080]   is a lot of times there's not liquidity. You can't just sell them if you need the money. You might
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:32.560]   need to keep them locked up for years and years. I know in the case of angel investing, yes,
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:39.120]   you could make lots of money, but most of the time you make no money. I've always personally
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.880]   thought of them as a separate pool. But I guess in my mind, it's like, "Well, 10% of my investment
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:51.760]   portfolio is for this other stuff." It's not easy to track. It's not easy to value. So I keep it
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.200]   separate. But you might not even have them in your portfolio in the first place. There are a lot of
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:03.440]   sophisticated investors that probably don't also. But I think they're always so flashy. I think
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.200]   people are excited about all these opportunities. I think it's hard for people to figure out what to
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:17.840]   do with them. Yeah. I think either with illiquid, uncertain assets, or I think you have maybe a
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:26.560]   similar problem in a situation where, let's say, the market's going up a lot and there's an
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:34.080]   opportunity to invest in either a really promising stock or some other thing, and maybe your friends
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.480]   are telling you about it. And the question is, "Well, how do you make a good decision
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   at that point?" And I think it comes back to having some investment philosophy that you
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.800]   understand and can stay in tune with. And then I think having a separate pool of money that you can
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:42:01.760]   be a little less restricted with. And if you're going to gain a lot of value or you think you
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.120]   really... I mean, you could be totally right about an angel investment opportunity.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.520]   So I think it makes sense to carve out and say, "This is how much I'm willing to
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:18.400]   allocate to my other bets portfolios." Yeah. And in a conversation, I think with
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.840]   Andy Ratcliffe, he was like, "If you need to set aside money to satisfy your desire to be more
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.240]   active so that you can let all of the passive stuff to do its thing, go for it. Because it's
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:37.200]   better for you to put 5% and mess around than it is to put 0% and then mess around on the overall
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:45.120]   pool." And I think, unfortunately, and maybe fortunately, passive index fund investing is not
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:51.360]   sexy. It's not like you're in there making trades. For the most part, at least in my portfolio,
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.520]   it's just sitting there. I'm not even checking it every day. I'm just letting it do its thing
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.640]   over a long period of time. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I think that's right.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.960]   It's not something that is fun to talk about at a party.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:11.280]   Yes. What are you doing? The market's up a ton. What are you doing? Oh, I'm waiting in my index
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:19.360]   fund. But I think for a lot of people, that's the... Well, I mean, there's a benefit in that,
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.440]   one, you're not spending a lot of time thinking about investing. You could spend it doing other
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:30.480]   things that maybe you like more. And you have the market working for you. So you're in it,
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.600]   you're benefiting from it. Yeah. Without a lot of effort. So we talked about almost all of these
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.640]   major asset classes, and we left off this big bucket that is really in a simple two-fund
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:47.360]   portfolio. It's your equities and your bonds or fixed income. You mentioned a few various types.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:55.520]   But in today's market, how do you even think about the allocation to bonds and fixed income?
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.880]   I know in some portfolios, if you dial your risk score up, they don't even exist.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.200]   And then you'll meet some people that are like, "Well, you need to have at least 30% or 40% of
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:10.320]   your portfolio in them." I feel like that bucket has the widest variation and lots of different
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:17.440]   opinions about how that fits in. And now, at least in 2024, with high interest rates,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.520]   is cash fall in that bucket or not? So I guess, how do you think about it?
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:28.720]   Well, I think it's worth breaking down some of the arguments of why it's helpful to have in there.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:36.880]   Because I think both the historical record and estimates of future returns are that,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.480]   on average, bonds are going to return less than equities. That's historically,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.880]   and that's I think what people are still projecting.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:56.320]   So it's not to necessarily increase your return. What it can do is act as a bit of a ballast
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:13.840]   in your portfolio in that it can offer return if you don't want to dial the risk further up.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:26.800]   But it also, in some economic situations, the price can move inversely with stocks.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:33.360]   So there may be a situation where stocks go down if growth expectations are low,
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:39.600]   and the value of your fixed income increases. So it not only can offer...
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.320]   Yeah, so it can kind of lower the overall volatility in your portfolio in some circumstances.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.680]   And that's a reason to have it.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.800]   And if you go back in time and look at major market corrections, 2008, the dot-com bubble,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:01.040]   before that, I would imagine that if your portfolio was a 50/50 portfolio in stocks and
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.760]   bonds versus 100% in equities, you probably would have not dropped as much.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   Right. Yeah. So I think there's a question, though, of...
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:18.240]   Okay, so let's say your risk... If you only said, "I'm going to hide some amount of my money under
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:24.800]   my mattress, and I'm going to put the rest in equities, then... And the amount I'm going to put
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.760]   in equities, I'm going to determine by my risk tolerance and capacity." Right? And let's say,
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.160]   "Okay, that means 50% of my money is in equities, and I'm going to put 50% under my mattress."
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:44.080]   Then the question is, "Well, what else can you do with it?" And what you find is if you
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:50.720]   assign some amount of diversification and actually negative correlation to the bonds,
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.360]   that means you may actually be able to put 55% or 60% of your portfolio in equities
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.160]   and the rest in bonds. Because if equities move down and bonds move up,
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:08.240]   then your total portfolio drop is going to be lower than if you just had 50% in equities and
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:13.280]   the rest under your mattress. So that's the difference. But instead of putting it on the
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.840]   mattress, you could have it in cash or in treasury bills, for example.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.480]   So in a way... And this actually was the mattress example, really clarified things.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.760]   You could think of your investment portfolio as all equities and then leave a large allocation
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:34.720]   to cash or outside of your portfolio to balance your risk. You've got $100,000. You don't want
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.280]   to lose it all. You only invest $50,000 and you leave $50,000 in cash. Not because you needed to
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.480]   buy a house, just because you don't want to invest all your money in the market and see it all go
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:47.920]   away. Or you could invest the full $100,000 in your portfolio, but just not have 100% of the
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.440]   portfolio in stocks and put them in some income-producing asset that isn't equities.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.040]   And today, that could be cash at a high-yield savings account. It could be treasuries. It could
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.720]   be corporate bonds. How do you think about what to do with that pool of non-equity,
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:12.800]   I guess, fixed-income assets? So I think there are kind of two parts of that question. One is
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:20.320]   how much risks should you take in the other side of your portfolio, the bond side of your
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:30.240]   portfolio? And I think people disagree about this, but my perspective is take the market risk
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:39.520]   on the other side, on the equity side. So that means I don't really like for individuals investing
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:45.040]   in corporate bonds, high-yield bonds. I'd say I'd focus on government bonds, which
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:53.840]   consider to be risk-free, credit risk-free. And then the question is within government bonds,
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:49:06.640]   what's the duration that you want to take on? And what that means is how much exposure to
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.840]   interest rate risk do you have? Cash on one side or very short treasury bills?
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:19.440]   No matter, you're going to earn the amount on the bill and
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:27.440]   the price of that bill is not going to really go up or down if the rest of the interest rates move.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.280]   You're just going to earn that amount. Versus a longer duration, if you buy a 30-year treasury
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:40.400]   bond or invest in a fund that has long treasury bonds, the value of that fund will go up and down
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:48.960]   as interest rates move. So if interest rates all go up, then let's say you want a 30-year treasury
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:57.280]   bond that yields 5%. If interest rates go up to 10% tomorrow and you own a 5% bond, then you could
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:04.320]   buy another bond at 10%. So your 5% bond is not worth nearly as much. So you're taking more interest
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:12.160]   rate risk. And that can be good or bad. I think in a down economic scenario where growth is low
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:18.880]   and the Fed cuts rates, long-term rates will probably drop. And that means the value of your
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.240]   longer-term bond holdings will go up. And it could go up at the exact point that the
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:30.160]   stocks may be falling. So longer duration means more interest rate risk, but potentially
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:36.720]   an offset to the equity risk. Which we saw over the last few years, after the recovery from the
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:42.640]   pandemic, the stock market heated up, it grew, inflation went up. And to combat that, we raised
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.400]   rates in the environment and your equity portfolio went up. But if you held a long-duration bond fund,
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:55.360]   it probably went down. And if that inverse happens, it could be a good hedge against that.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.200]   And I think it's something interesting because if you hold a portfolio of bonds and you see,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.560]   "Gosh, interest rates are rising on bonds. That's good, right?" Actually, it's good if you're about
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:10.560]   to buy the bond. It's not good if you already own the fund that has them. And I think a challenge
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.960]   here is you look at these long-term bonds and you see lower yields and you think, "Wouldn't my money
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:21.360]   just be better in a 5% high yield savings account?" And the answer is probably for the next week,
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:28.560]   yes. But as we've seen in the past, I think just in the last five years, I think we've seen interest
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   rates go from 2%, 3% all the way down to zero, all the way back up to five. If right now interest
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.800]   rates in a high yield savings account are 5% and let's say next year, for whatever reason,
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:47.600]   they drop to zero, that 3% long-term bond is probably not going to be the price it is.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.920]   You're not going to get the return you will get now on the long-term bond that you would then.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.040]   So you might think, "Gosh, getting three now doesn't make sense because I'm getting five."
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.400]   But if the rate in your high yield savings account dropped to zero, you probably couldn't get three
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.160]   for 30 years anymore. Maybe it's one or one and a half. I don't know the right numbers.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:09.520]   I think sometimes people look at these long-term things and think, "Well, the return's not as good
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.200]   as what I'm getting now, so I'll just stick with treasuries or I'll just stick with cash because
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:23.040]   it's a higher return." But if that return goes away, you can't get that seemingly higher long-term
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.240]   rate. So how could we compare a cash interest rate to a longer-term bond interest rate?
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:39.600]   Yeah. I think the comparison I would make is that if you have cash, let's say cash versus
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:48.480]   a 10-year treasury bond. If you own cash or a three-month treasury bill, then you're saying,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.720]   "Okay, every day or every three months or whatever the amount of time you need to reinvest,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.800]   that you're going to basically take the average interest rate over the next 10 years."
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:03.120]   If it's 5% today and then it goes to zero and stays there, then your average is going to be
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:08.160]   just above zero interest rate you'll have earned. Versus with a 10-year treasury bond,
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:14.880]   if you buy it and hold it, you're going to, if it's four point something percent,
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:20.880]   you're going to earn that four point something percent over the 10 years. So your average
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:27.120]   interest rate will be four something versus just above zero if interest rates go down tomorrow.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.000]   So if you look at this 10-year bond, how is it priced? Is it just a bunch of really smart people
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.480]   trying to guess what the interest rates are going to do over the next 10 years and price it such
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:43.600]   that unless I disagree with a bunch of smart people who are all trading in the open market,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.120]   presumably I don't have inside knowledge. The same reason I don't like picking stocks is there's a
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.040]   bunch of smart people pricing any individual stock. I don't think I can do better than them.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:59.120]   Does the same principle apply to bonds in that if I want to get the best interest rate over 10 years,
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.040]   am I not just better buying the market than trying to pick and choose 5% now and something else
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:12.560]   later? So that's a big component of how that number comes about. Why does the 10-year bond
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.840]   trade it for something is because a lot of smart people have said, "Okay, well, I think the interest
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.720]   rate here is going to be here. At one year out, it's going to be this. Two years out, it's going
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   to be this." And that's a market that is traded. You can trade these future prices. So a big part
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:36.240]   is people making an estimate of what the average short-term rate is going to be over that time.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:44.080]   There's also this idea of a bond risk premium in that maybe you should be compensated additionally
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:50.640]   for the fact that you're buying a longer-term riskier security that can go up and down versus
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.200]   cash you have a guaranteed return. It's not the only component, but it's a major one that goes
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:07.440]   into it. In addition to potentially being compensated for having a riskier asset, there's
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:16.640]   also potential supply-demand factors as the Fed is going to be buying or selling these bonds that
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.520]   can also affect that rate. I guess it means depending on the economic climate, the Fed can
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.080]   make these actions to try to slow down or speed up the economy that will affect rates, and that'll
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.360]   affect all of these prices. We don't really know what they are. The Fed chose to do quantitative
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:39.680]   easing, which meant buying treasury bonds and mortgage bonds, which drove the yields lower.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.480]   I think a lot of people believed lower than what that average rate would have been.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:50.640]   Okay. That changed the assumptions people were making, and depending on which side you were on,
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.560]   you had a better or worse outcome. Right.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:59.360]   Think about risk. Just to quickly recap building the portfolio, because I want to talk a lot about
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.920]   implementing it. First, you need to think about your risk, your tolerance for it, your capacity
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:09.840]   for it. You can go online. You can look at questionnaires. You can think about it internally.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.720]   You can look at how you behaved in the past and come up with an idea of that. Then you have to
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.120]   build a portfolio. We talked about a lot of places you could get inspiration. We talked about some of
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.680]   the different asset classes. You can go look at the lazy portfolios online. You could use any one
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.520]   of these investment advisors like a Wealthfront or a Betterment to build a portfolio and see how
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:34.960]   it works and dial in what you want. Now we have a portfolio. You could potentially even have a
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:40.160]   conversation with ChatGPT to say, "Help me think about how to build this portfolio," if you want
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:46.320]   someone that's not a paid investment advisor, but a dialogue partner. We'll come back to that,
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.360]   because I think there are some challenges and some benefits to doing that.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:55.120]   Let's assume that everyone listening has paused and created a portfolio, so they have something.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   How do you put that into place? I imagine some people will have already had this in place.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.600]   First, let's talk about putting it into place. Then what happens if you realize that what you
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:11.120]   have now isn't what you necessarily want? For someone listening that has some money
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:17.040]   ready to invest and now has gone through this process, do you just pick your index funds,
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:24.560]   decide, "I'm going to do, for the sake of argument, 70/30 split and total global market in
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:30.160]   the 70 and total bond market in the 30," and you just dump it all in now? How do you think about
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:37.360]   whether it makes sense to slowly invest over time, invest all up front, or even potentially hold out
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:43.840]   and wait for the market to drop and try to buy at the bottom? I think a lot of the decisions...
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:53.680]   Thinking about these types of questions, there's what is the maximum theoretical value going to
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:01.840]   tell you? Then there's what should you actually do? What you should actually do is not necessarily
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:08.080]   the thing that's going to maximize to the scent of the expected value of your portfolio.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:14.800]   You have to behave in a way that makes sense to you, that you're comfortable with.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.160]   I think if you're sitting ready to invest, but you haven't invested a lot now,
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:30.000]   investing everything at once and then seeing the ups and downs in the portfolio as the market moves
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:38.560]   around, that may be a very painful experience if you're not used to seeing that. That would be an
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:45.200]   argument to step in a little bit at a time. Yeah. I remember this Vanguard study where it said,
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:51.280]   "Technically, lump sum investing was better." That makes sense because in the long run,
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.520]   the market goes up. If you assume that on average, the market goes up every day,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.280]   not that it actually does, but if you assume on average, it always goes up,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.600]   then you're better off putting it all in now than waiting. But in the circumstance, it goes down.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.560]   If you're going to be able to not live with yourself for making the decision to put it all
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:17.200]   in the day before the market went down, you could invest over time. That might not have the highest
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:23.600]   expected value, but it might make you feel better. Yeah. If it's something that you can actually do
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:32.080]   and feel better about versus hesitate or not do or feel terrible about, that seems like a good
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:38.080]   approach to step in over time. Yeah. When a lot of these studies say the expected value is better
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:44.640]   to invest it all up front, it's not better 99.999% of the time. If it was, then the expected value
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:50.400]   would be so much higher. It's probably, and I'm making this number up, but it's probably better
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:56.640]   more closer to 60% or 70% of the time, or maybe even less than that, maybe like 55%.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:03.600]   It's not like dollar-cost averaging versus investing all at once. The outcome is not,
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.760]   on average, five times better. It's probably marginally better. I think sometimes it's like,
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   "Let's minimize the regrets I might have about the way I acted instead of get the best possible
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.160]   value." Yeah. That makes sense. I think if you had to put an order of magnitude,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.000]   if I had to guess the order of magnitude of the benefit, it's like, "Okay, on average,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:37.120]   if the global equity market has outperformed inflation by 5% and call inflation to be 2%,
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:44.880]   that's 7% gross return. If you average in over the course of a year, then on average,
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.920]   you're going to be half invested. That's 3.5% of expected return that you'd be missing out on."
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.040]   If that means that it's something that you're much more comfortable with,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.640]   that may be a 3.5% you're happy to pay. Also, I don't even think you factored in in that math,
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.320]   the fact that while that money is all sitting in cash waiting for you to invest it right now,
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.040]   Oh, that's true.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:11.200]   you're probably also earning 5% on that cash. The delta is really that 2%
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   spread out over the year, and it just shrinks down a lot more.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.520]   That's a good point with the higher interest rates currently.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:25.280]   Yeah. Right now is actually a better time to dollar cost average than lump sum invest just
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:32.160]   because the money while you're not investing is actually earning a return. Whereas a handful of
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.160]   years ago, if it was earning zero, it might give you a little bit more angst about not investing.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.240]   Maybe not investing, watching the market go up while your money earned zero would actually be
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.160]   the thing that stresses you out a lot, and it might push you in the other direction to actually
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:52.640]   want to invest everything right now. What do you think about if someone's thinking, "Gosh,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.400]   I already have an investment portfolio. I've now gone through this process and realized it was
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.240]   either too complicated or it wasn't right for me, or I just want to simplify it and do something
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.880]   different." How do you think about that transition when it's already in the market, but you need to
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:10.720]   transition to something else? What are the ways you would decide when and how and over what period
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.080]   of time to migrate from one portfolio to the next? I think one thing that comes to mind
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:27.600]   is I guess a potential blocker to moving could be if you have a lot of gains that have unrealized
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:36.800]   gains in the portfolio, then if you were to sell those positions and buy other different ones,
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.840]   then you can actually realize those gains and then that can have an impact on your taxes,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:50.160]   maybe a significant impact on your taxes. I think that would be a reason to think harder about what
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:58.880]   a change in strategy can look like. But yeah, if you're thinking about simplifying and you don't
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:05.680]   have that issue, yeah, I don't see what- You would just sell and buy something different.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:12.640]   And buy something different. Yeah. What do you think would slow someone down or should?
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.280]   Yeah. I guess the taxes one for me has always been one because I had some old
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.720]   index funds that I was like, "I don't really want these," but they're at a low cost basis.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.880]   I would say my one thing was at least wait till you've held them a year because you get better
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.520]   tax treatment in the US holding equities for a year and selling them than you do paying short
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:38.880]   term cap gains. I think sometimes there's an emotional hold up, which is like I meet a lot
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.280]   of people who, especially people that work at companies like tech companies that they own a
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.200]   piece of the company and say, "Gosh, my portfolio right now is 50% Google." And listening to this
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.240]   makes me think it's not very diversified. And I probably shouldn't hold 50% Google.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.880]   And I remember we would always ask these clients this question of, "Okay, if you sold it all now
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.720]   by mistake and you sat on a pile of cash and you had to decide how to invest it, would you invest
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.840]   50% of it back into Google?" And people are like, "No, no, I would never do that." And then we'd say,
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.320]   "Great. So then we agree you should sell the Google stock now and you should buy this new
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.720]   portfolio." And they're like, "Yeah, yeah. As soon as Google hits like 120..." I don't even know
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.880]   what Google's priced at right now, but it was always like, "As soon as it gets 20% more,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.920]   then I'll sell it." And I feel like that, not necessarily because of taxes, but more about
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:34.000]   trying to time the sale of the asset they hold now and feeling like it's not where it should be
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.760]   has always hung up a lot of people. Yeah. Well, I think... I really like that framing,
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:46.720]   saying, "Okay, if you were all in cash today, what would your ideal investment portfolio be?"
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.320]   Because I think it's really clarifying to move away from where you are now, because
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:56.560]   putting aside the potential tax complications of actually moving it, it's a good framing to say,
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:01.360]   "Okay, where should I be?" And then you can move there either quickly or more slowly.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.480]   And I think that's a really hard decision for people to make, to sell their company stock.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:12.720]   They feel personally invested in it. In a lot of cases, people have, particularly Google,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:19.760]   gained a lot of wealth by holding it. So it seems like maybe that's not the best decision to sell
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.920]   all this thing that's worked so well for them. But yeah, I think that framing is really helpful.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.000]   I think one thing that I've also done, which I think is something not everyone does... I think
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.200]   you will probably lose if you compare Google to investing in the total stock market since Google's
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:41.440]   IPO. I think Google's probably outperformed the total stock market by a lot, but it won't look as
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.320]   good if you compare it to zero. And so I think sometimes people that are holding a stock for
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:53.040]   five years and they look at it and they're like, "Wow, my stock's up 100%." Well, if you had invested
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.160]   in the stock market for five years, I'm not saying it would have gone up 100%, but you want to make
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.800]   sure you're at least comparing things apples to apples. And so a lot of times I see people say,
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.440]   "Gosh, I don't want to sell this thing. It's been doing so great." And it's like,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.400]   "Has the market also been doing so great?" Because the US stock market for the last
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.840]   century has been doing pretty great. There are windows of time it hasn't.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:21.920]   So I think making sure you realize that by selling a few stocks and buying an index,
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.640]   well, one, you're still even holding those stocks. Google is a big chunk of the total stock market
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.280]   also. So you're not getting rid of all of it, or at least all the exposure. But also you're
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:38.560]   buying into a asset class that also goes up over time. And so you're not giving up all the returns.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:46.880]   Okay. So we moved into this portfolio. A question that I've both gotten and thought about a lot is,
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.800]   well, it's easy to think about your investment portfolio and say, "Great. We want a 70/30 split
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:58.480]   of these two index funds. That's pretty simple." But I actually have between me and my partner,
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:04.400]   what if I have five accounts? What if I have my 401k, we've got a Roth IRA in both of our names,
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:10.160]   and then we've got this taxable brokerage account. Now I have five accounts. They have three different
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:18.240]   types of tax treatments. Do I just buy the same portfolio in all five? Or as I'm sure some people
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:24.800]   listening know, there is a case to be made for certain types of investments being really tax
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:30.560]   efficient or tax inefficient, and that putting them in different accounts could make the overall
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:37.920]   portfolio perform better. Yeah. It's certainly true that there's that opportunity for additional
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:45.520]   optimization. It's like, because assets are taxed differently and accounts have different tax
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:54.560]   treatment of the assets inside, then there's opportunity to optimize that. And I think there
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.960]   is additional value to doing that. The question is, how much value is there? And that depends on
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:09.120]   your tax situation and how much money you have invested, and also how complicated is it? And
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.920]   what's your appetite to do it yourself? And how much do you value your own time?
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:25.760]   So I think it's just like a rough ballpark way to think about the benefit of it. If you say
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:35.840]   you have, call it you're considering moving 20% of your portfolio to a tax-advantaged account,
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.720]   and that 20% that wasn't there, you're going to move somewhere else. And you say, okay, well,
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:51.920]   and that 20%, I expect to earn, let's say, 5%, have a 5% return. So then you're talking about,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.360]   okay, how is that 1% of your portfolio return taxed? Because you're talking about the 5%
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.120]   return of 20% of the portfolio, 20% of- Yeah, so we're doing 1%, and we're saying,
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.360]   okay, we're going to optimize the taxation of that 1% return. And say, okay, well, in a
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:18.720]   high marginal tax rate of, let's say, call it 37%, in that one asset gets poor tax treatment,
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.800]   and one asset gets good tax treatment, and it's taxed at 15%. And you're saying,
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.880]   okay, what's the difference in that? It's like, that's 22% difference in the tax rate.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.200]   So you're saying, okay, well, I'm going to have a 22% difference in the tax rate
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:39.440]   on that 1% of return. That ends up being 0.2% of your portfolio in additional return due to this
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.720]   tax optimization. And I would consider a pretty good scenario where you're doing 20% in the best
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.640]   tax treatment or the worst tax treatment. So 0.2%, that's something, that's not nothing.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.000]   And depending on the size of your portfolio, that could be significant,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.840]   and that could compound over time. But I think the implementation of it is usually not so
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:12.320]   straightforward. And I think it's something that I've done, maybe you've tried and done,
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.520]   that you need a spreadsheet, and you need to figure out what assets go where to make sure
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:25.360]   you have the right overall balance. So there is really a time and mental overhead of cost to doing
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.560]   it. Yeah, I think one thing that I learned trying to do this, because there's this great image that
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.040]   I'll link to in the show notes, or I'll overlay right here if you're watching on video, where
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.680]   it's like, what are the most to the least tax efficient things? And there's kind of two components
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:46.560]   to it. One is the tax treatment, and one is the expected growth. If your equities are going to
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:53.040]   grow at a rate that you expect to be higher than your bonds, then having your equities be in your
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:59.200]   Roth IRA that will not have any taxes in the future versus your bonds that will have a lower return,
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.280]   that could make sense. Your bonds also, though, might be taxed depending on whether they're
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:09.440]   qualified at higher rates. So maybe there's a counter argument there. There's a great story
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:16.000]   about a handful of people who have taken their Roth IRAs and invested in startups that have been
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.320]   the highest returning things. And because they had no future taxes in their Roth IRA,
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.880]   they got all those things tax free. The downside there would be obviously you're taking your
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:31.120]   retirement money and betting it on something that could go to zero, which is not a good
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:38.240]   retirement plan for most people. What I found doing this was there's another part that makes
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:43.520]   it complicated, which is it's unlikely that whatever your allocation to one asset is,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:49.520]   is the exact balance of your 401(k). So in our circumstance, we had two Roth IRAs,
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.280]   two 401(k)s, and a taxable account. So we had five accounts. And if we decided that our perfect
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.960]   portfolio was even 70/30, which would be the easiest one, or a two fund portfolio, obviously
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.160]   100% zero would be the easiest one. Then we're not doing any optimization. You're like, "Okay,
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.480]   well, I'm going to put these in here." One of the accounts is ultimately going to have
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.880]   two things in it. And as one account grows, it's going to grow faster or differently because they
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.560]   don't have the same thing in it. And now when you're trying to rebalance between them to stick
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   to your core portfolio, I found myself being like, "Okay, in my 401(k), I need to sell a little bit
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:33.040]   of this to make up for this. And oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on. My 401(k) is all pre-tax. So even
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.920]   though there's 50 grand in my 401(k), 50 grand in my 401(k) isn't the same as 50 grand in my
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.480]   taxable account. So what should I actually count that at? And if I'm thinking about this overall
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.760]   portfolio, should I think about it after tax?" And then all of a sudden, I'm like, "Oh, wait.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.560]   Well, these things are up and I'm going to have to pay long-term capital gains because they're in my
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.200]   taxable account. The Roth IRA, I'm going to pay no taxes." Even just figuring out how many dollars
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:02.000]   I had was so much headache that I couldn't actually manage it. It just didn't make sense.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   And I just couldn't figure out how to rebalance it. And I just stuck with it. And I just didn't
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.400]   make changes. And I was in a portfolio that wasn't the portfolio I wanted because it was too
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.720]   complicated to figure out how to get to the portfolio I wanted. And ultimately, I just switched
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.360]   and said, "I'm just going to have the same portfolio in all of them," because it was a little easier.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.520]   Is it the most tax efficient? Absolutely not. Could I get that little extra return doing something?
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:33.520]   Probably. But would I actually manage it? No. And we'll get to some optimizations next,
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:40.720]   like tax loss harvesting or rebalancing. Is the expected value of being able to do those things
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:47.520]   higher than the expected value of the tax aware allocation? And if so, then you're actually better
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.240]   off making sure you can do that. However, if you are someone who loves to keep these spreadsheets,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.720]   can value all of these balances appropriately and figure out what they're worth based on their future
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:04.240]   taxes, and do this and with ease, you're probably going to end up better in the long run in terms of
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.080]   returns by putting your most tax efficient things in one account and your least tax efficient things
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.720]   in another and your highest returning assets in another and balancing it. I just wasn't someone
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:22.320]   who could keep on top of it. And I think another thing to consider when considering a strategy like
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:28.800]   this, when you're kind of in your head, mixing together your retirement account and your brokerage
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.640]   account is that I think a lot of people may find it helpful to say, "Okay, this is my retirement
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:40.720]   money that you could think about investing. And this is my brokerage money. I'm going to set aside
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.400]   my retirement account money as something else." So a prerequisite to thinking about this tax aware
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:51.360]   application is that you really have to think about everything as the same thing, just with
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.840]   different features to it, which I don't think everyone's there. Yeah. Especially if you're
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.960]   thinking, "I'm a little bit younger. One day I'm going to buy a house. So the money in my investment
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.040]   portfolio might have a 10-year horizon, but the money in my retirement account might have a 40-year
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.960]   horizon." Those are very different. And we didn't talk about this at the outset, but I think because
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:19.840]   we both had this discussion for hours and years ago, the investment portfolio is for money that
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.000]   you don't need to touch in the short term. Now, we could debate whether the short term is three
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.680]   years or five years or 10 years, but the general principle was we're not going to take an investment.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.000]   Our investment portfolio is money we don't need soon. It's not for the house we want in a few
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.640]   years. It's not for the company that we're going to start, or it's not to fund our life to take a
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.360]   sabbatical because we don't want to be in a circumstance where we need that money and the
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.680]   market's down and we have to sell while the market's down and we miss on the upswing because
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.800]   in the long run, the reason the market returns over 30, 40, 50 years or however many years your
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.480]   horizon is, is because it goes down and up and you need the down and the up.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:05.680]   Yeah, I think that's a really good point in that this consistency of good returns for equities,
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:11.360]   it's always over a long time horizon. If you look at two or three-year chunks of equities,
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:20.000]   there are wild swings so that you want to give yourself the benefit if you're coming up with a
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.200]   investment strategy that has historical support for producing good returns over inflation,
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.400]   over long time periods. You want to give yourself that long time period to let it work.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:37.360]   Yep. Let's talk about some of these other optimizations. Rebalancing. Unfortunately,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.040]   it's not one thing to figure out, "Here's my portfolio and don't touch it for 30 years."
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.120]   Mm-hmm (affirmative).
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.760]   Because if you're in a portfolio of equities and bonds and the equities went up a lot and the
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.720]   bonds didn't, you're now at a different portfolio than you planned. If you wanted 70/30, maybe now
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:58.000]   you're at 75/25 or 80/20. How important is it to rebalance the portfolio and how often should
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.040]   people be thinking about when to do it? Yeah. I do think it's important because
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:14.240]   that asset allocation is important to keep the target risk that you're looking for
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.640]   in the portfolio. Rebalancing, make sure that you don't stray too far, either too low or too high
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:29.760]   from that target risk. In terms of when to rebalance, there's certainly a lot of diminishing
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:39.280]   returns to it. If you rebalance every day to make sure that you have the exact, you're not 70.01%,
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.760]   then that's going to take a lot of time and not provide a lot of value to you.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.000]   If you rebalance once a year, I think that's going to get you the vast majority of the benefit.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.360]   I'd say one other potential... You could say, "On one day a year, I'm going to go rebalance."
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:04.400]   That's a reasonable approach. Another way to augment that a little bit is that
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.200]   when there's a big market move, you may consider rebalancing. If there's a big move down or up,
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:17.520]   depending on the size of it, you may say, "Okay, well, I know it's not December 15th yet, but I'm
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.800]   going to take this time to say, 'Okay, well, now it's an opportunity to make sure I have the right
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:29.840]   amount of risk.'" What about tax-loss harvesting? How do you think about that as something worth
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:38.320]   doing or doing at a similar cadence or more frequently? For those who aren't familiar,
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:46.160]   I'll just give a quick overview, which is that when you have an asset, let's say you invest in
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.960]   the total stock market and it's down 20% because we're in the middle of a pandemic, you could
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:58.960]   leave it down. Let's say you bought it at $100, and now it's at $80. It's down. You could leave
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:05.280]   it there, or you could sell it at $80, spend that $80 to buy something very correlated and similar,
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:11.440]   but not exactly the same. Not the same VTI, but maybe a Schwab index fund that tracks the market.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.640]   Now you'll have a lower cost basis. You'll have an $80 cost basis, but that $20 loss from that
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.680]   first purchase, you can actually use to offset some income up to $3,000 a year or other gains
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.400]   and continue to grow that other position over time. The more you collect these losses,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.320]   I will say in some cases, the easier it is for you to change things in your portfolio that create
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:44.640]   taxable events. Do you think you can go overboard, or is it rebalancing? Once a year is probably
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:57.360]   enough. I think before you embark on the tax loss harvesting, there are a lot of rules that you need
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:05.840]   to follow, and there are some logistical challenges of doing it. You'd want to become familiar with
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:15.200]   what is a realized versus unrealized loss. What are the different types of these losses? Are there
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:28.160]   short-term losses, long-term losses? There's this complexity, because if you sell something and
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:36.960]   rebuy it, you can create a wash sale. None of this is tax advice. It's a way of saying that
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:44.960]   there are a lot of rules around how to actually achieve these realized losses
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:52.000]   that you need to be aware of before you start going down this road. If you want to go down the
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:04.240]   road, then I think you need a spreadsheet to approach it, because you need to track how much
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:13.120]   loss is in each of your positions, potentially each lot that you've bought of your positions,
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:20.000]   and then what are equivalent funds that you could sell one of and then buy more to get the right
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:34.080]   allocation. I think that's the minimum requirements to get started. The benefit of it is
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.480]   really dependent on your situation. If you're already in a portfolio that has a lot of gains in
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:47.840]   it, you may not really have a lot of opportunity to harvest tax losses, because the investments
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.640]   have already been going up. Yeah, yeah. If you bought the total stock market 10, 15, 20 years
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:58.240]   ago, your cost basis at this point is so low that even if the market crashed 20%, you probably
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:04.960]   wouldn't have a loss. Whereas if you just started investing last year and we have a market correction
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.240]   of 20% next week, you'll probably have losses in your portfolio. You can harvest the whole portfolio.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.320]   Yeah. I think it's fair to say, one, yeah, you have to understand all these rules. These rules
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:23.440]   don't just apply in one account. If you are in five different accounts, your retirement account,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:28.080]   your taxable account, and you're selling one thing and buying it in another, that can create
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:34.880]   an issue. I find that if you want to do tax loss harvesting on your own, you should really
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:42.560]   understand it. I know some people that even trade in different funds in all their different accounts
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.720]   because they want to make sure they're not mistakenly triggering any of these rules and
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:53.840]   causing taxes when they think they're saving money. Maybe not. Now, if you have two funds,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.000]   right? If you have a two-fund portfolio and let's say you have no retirement accounts,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.080]   you just have your taxable account, maybe you could make a case that it's a little easier.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:12.880]   Who's going to benefit most from the tax loss harvesting? I think it's people who don't have
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:19.760]   investments that already have a lot of gains in them and that they're either adding money or
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.880]   they're adding money investing currently so that they can monitor if those investments go down and
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:32.640]   they could try to sell them and realize gains. Then I think there's, again, significantly
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:41.200]   diminishing returns from doing it more frequently. I think one of the big benefits of tax loss
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.720]   harvesting is that for some people, if they have a net realized loss in their account, they can
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:56.720]   offset their income with their capital losses. I will flag, we're talking about being able to
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.880]   take a loss that you would have been able to in the future offset your gains, which means
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   maybe you could offset your long-term capital gains rate at 20 plus state taxes. Let's call it
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:15.760]   25%. Instead, you can offset your income, which could be at 45%. You're getting a 20% arbitrage.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.680]   The one that's like best case, and two, it's capped at $3,000 a year. You might think, "Well,
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.360]   $3,000 is a meaningful part, but if you're at a lower income, you're probably not at a high
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.920]   enough tax rate that it's going to do that much for you anyways." I think the real value where
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:37.280]   it comes into play is if you have a really substantial existing gains, let's say you've
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:41.920]   held that Google stock for many, many years and you want to trade it into your portfolio.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.120]   If you're able over time to accumulate losses, it'll make the gains from selling that Google
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:53.040]   position much more tolerable because you might not have to pay those taxes. I know I needed to
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:25:01.520]   sell a lot of my portfolio sometime, I don't know, maybe two, three years ago. Because I had tax loss
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:06.960]   harvested in the middle of the pandemic, I was able to create a lot of losses. When I had to
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.240]   make that portfolio change, it didn't cost me any taxes because I'd been holding onto these losses.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:19.120]   I felt good. I was not managing that myself. Our investments are at Wealthfront, they're automating
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:24.400]   all the tax loss harvesting, they've written some white papers about the value of tax loss harvesting.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:33.360]   My personal non-advice belief is that there is value, probably more than the 0.25% fee,
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.240]   if you also factor that that fee means I don't have to think about it.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:42.960]   But if I try to execute it on my own, it goes back to the tax aware allocation thing, which is like,
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:48.080]   I just, I'm not going to do it. I think it's possible to do on your own. I think it's not
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.640]   possible to do it at the level of sophistication that Wealthfront does it on their own, but you can
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.120]   capture a lot of the benefit. But like I said before, you have to know all the rules, have a
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   plan, make your spreadsheet and do it. I think your points are exactly right in that if, well,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:13.840]   I think, yeah, I think one, if you have some big sale of an asset with a gain, that makes it super
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.720]   helpful, but also in the rebalancing, if you imagine what rebalancing would look like from a
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:28.960]   tax perspective, right? It's like if equities go up, then you're going to be, if equities go up
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:36.080]   more than bonds, then you would sell some equities and invest that into bonds. So that's going to
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.080]   potentially produce a gain that if you have done tax loss harvesting and have been kind of in the
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.600]   right place, right time, and that you've invested money and it's gone down, you're able to realize
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.000]   that and you're able to offset that gain. So you wouldn't necessarily have to pay taxes on that.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.960]   Yeah. One other downside I find of tax loss harvesting is just that
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:59.840]   depending on the times at which all of these things happen, your US stock market allocation
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.560]   might now have two or even three different index funds. And for some people, that's not a problem.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.720]   For some people like me, it's like, I just want it to be simple. And now I find myself saying,
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.880]   well, now I just want to sell one of them so that I just have one of the same index fund. I don't
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.040]   want two or three. It's just easier for me to look at. And having to sell those things and pay taxes
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.640]   on them is like- Then you have gains in those.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.240]   Yeah. Yeah. So I think if you want something simple, I would say either let someone else
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:36.800]   manage it or be excited about managing something complex or wait until very, very big moments,
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:43.440]   like the entire market's down 30% and those could be the times, but doing it regularly on your own
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.760]   seems like a nightmare. Yeah. And you still have to learn all the rules, even if you're doing it
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:54.080]   once at a time. Yes, you definitely do. What do you think about direct indexing? Because I know
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.720]   there's this company FRAC, which just launched, which is like direct indexing as a service.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.920]   And the general idea is you could buy the S&P 500 index fund, but you could also just buy the
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:11.440]   500 companies in the S&P and you could, one, avoid the expense ratio and two-
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.200]   0.05%. Yeah. And to be clear, to pay for any-
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.440]   How much is that company? I think it's like 15 basis points. So
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.360]   you're not going to really avoid the expense ratio, I guess. The upside would be now that you
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:33.120]   own 500 companies, at any given point in time, there are companies that are failing in the U.S.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:39.440]   stock market. And so if you own the whole stock market, on average, it goes up. If you own every
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.360]   company, then you can harvest the losses of the companies that fail while they're failing and
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.520]   capture more stock, obviously not something you'd want to do on your own, but you could capture more
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:57.600]   tax losses than you would otherwise. So I think the reason why I would not do that myself,
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.920]   are they a sponsor? No, I don't know. No sponsor.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:13.280]   The reason I would not do that myself is I think the... I'm a little bit risk averse here,
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:18.800]   right? Imagine the circumstance where you have this company managing the 500 stocks for you,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.520]   doing the tax loss harvesting. Okay, great. Sounds reasonable.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:28.720]   What if they stop doing that? And they say, "Okay, we're not offering the service anymore.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:34.400]   Here are your 500 stocks with gains in them." Because yeah, all the other ones have... They've
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.760]   sold all the ones with losses. What do you do then? Yeah, then you're managing a brokerage
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.960]   account with 500 individuals. Really, what would you do though?
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:49.280]   I don't know. I really don't know what I'd do in that circumstance.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.320]   I guess at that point, you'd hope another company had started that you could say,
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.320]   "Can I transfer my 500 stocks to you so you can manage them?"
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.840]   Maybe try to find a company that Angel invest in that could manage it for you.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:09.120]   Yeah. That is the biggest downside I've heard from people who use a service that does direct
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:14.000]   indexing, decide they don't want to use that service. And now they're stuck either managing
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.440]   500 individual positions, which I can assure you rebalancing in between is going to be
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:26.960]   next to impossible on your own, or they're forced to sell out of them at probably a gain just because
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:32.960]   the market goes up over time. And so that would be the downside. If you are using a company for
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:41.280]   direct indexing, you are probably making a bet that that company or a company that can take over
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:47.360]   that portfolio will be around for a very long time, or you will be managing 500 or however
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:51.520]   many individual stocks, or you will be forced to sell them if that company stops operating.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.320]   It sounds like for you, it's like, "Not a risk I want to take."
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.400]   It doesn't sound like a good trade to me.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:02.960]   I'm still doing it, but I think maybe I'm-
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.760]   You may be too late now. Now you can't stop.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.000]   Now I can't. I'm still doing it because I can't stop doing it.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.080]   So another potential threat is what if they raise prices?
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.320]   Yeah. You're stuck paying those prices.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.800]   Yeah. You're stuck paying those prices.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:21.280]   Yeah. It's something that now that that portfolio is up, I'm like, "Well, I guess I'm-"
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.480]   I can either pay the prices or realize all the gains in these stocks.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:30.720]   Yeah. So I guess I'm stuck in it. But because of it, I have harvested way more
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:34.400]   losses than I would have otherwise. So at least if I ever wanted to sell out of it-
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.000]   You'd be partially offset.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:43.280]   I'd be partially offset. Other things along the lines of maintenance and ongoing stuff,
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.560]   when should people think about changing their portfolio?
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.280]   Because we talked about how to think about constructing it, but does it change over time?
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:55.760]   I think there are a couple of ways that the risk tolerance could change.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:04.560]   One is become a more experienced investor where you become more familiar with how the market will
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:10.560]   move and you become more comfortable with seeing up and down in your portfolio.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:18.400]   Another is your financial situation can change where you may have continued to save more money
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:24.080]   and say, "Oh, I'm actually comfortable putting more at risk." Or you could say, "I'm less
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.720]   comfortable putting more at risk because I don't expect to be earning as much or whatever in the
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:35.040]   future." And then I think an important way it could change is if you're combining finances with
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:41.440]   a partner. And then you're not only thinking about what your tolerance is, but you're thinking about
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:47.440]   what your combined tolerance is and what's the lowest tolerance of the combination of you.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.480]   Yeah. Okay. And when that happens, it's like rebalancing. It's time to adjust things over time.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:33:00.960]   How do you think about... Maybe we'll slot this earlier, Ben. When it comes to all of these
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:06.800]   changes, how do you think about doing them by buying and selling things, doing them as you're
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:12.960]   investing each month, doing them by reinvesting dividends? Are there easier ways to make the
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.240]   ongoing management work when it comes to ongoing investments and what you tell your
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:23.520]   brokerage firm to do with any dividends? I think it probably doesn't matter too much
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.600]   practically. The amounts you'll probably be changing are relatively small. I think
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:34.400]   the easier to manage is just have a reinvest dividends and you don't have to think about it
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:43.360]   if you let it go a little bit longer between rebalancing. But an approach that I use and I
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   think some other people use is that you don't reinvest the dividends and you take the money
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:55.200]   that's spit off every month or quarter and use that to true up to the right allocation to the
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:58.880]   extent you can. And then you may have to make a bigger change if the market moves or something,
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.080]   and you may have to buy and sell. But that's a way of avoiding a little bit of the friction.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.960]   And that strategy probably feels better right now when the money that's uninvested is probably in a
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.600]   money market fund earning 5%. Would you probably feel a little differently if the
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:21.200]   uninvested cash was earning 0% or is the headache it saves kind of?
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:28.240]   Well, I think the uninvested cash is only uninvested for a little bit because you can get
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:34.240]   the dividend either each month, maybe it's a bond fund or each quarter. And then you let all the
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.760]   dividends come in and then you can take those dividends and invest it. So they would only be
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.560]   sitting there for maybe a couple of weeks or a few weeks. So yeah, I mean, maybe it's not
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:48.160]   super optimal, but I don't know. It seems reasonable to me.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:48.800]   Didn't stress you out.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.680]   Yeah, it didn't stress me out.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:56.080]   And let's talk about uninvested cash because I think we already talked about the portfolio and
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.840]   how you could leave cash outside to adjust your risk. But I remember when the pandemic was going
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.560]   on and we were down 30% and all I could think was, "Well, I'm pretty confident the market's
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.280]   going to go up over time. Really wish I had some of my money not invested." Not just because it
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:16.320]   wouldn't have been down. Obviously, anytime the market drops, it would be nice to have not been
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.760]   invested. But mostly because I was like, "Gosh, this seems like a once-in-a-decade buying
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:29.600]   opportunity right now. The market's down 30%, but I would have had to leave this money uninvested
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:36.080]   and had the market not gone down." So how do you think about leaving cash aside for opportunities,
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.640]   whether the market is down or some other thing happens? I know you used to call this
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.320]   your elephant hunting fund, but how do you think about that?
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:50.960]   I think on average, it's not going to be a good idea. On average, you're going to do better,
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.120]   I think, by having it invested. There could be a psychological benefit to having money set aside,
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.480]   but I don't think it's going to be on average better to wait for a downturn. You may feel
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:07.840]   very smart if you set the money aside and then a year later, there's a big downturn,
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.400]   you can invest it all and make 30% of the money. But yeah, I think on average, it's probably not
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:20.560]   going to work out. I also think it's incredibly hard to know when the market is at the bottom.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.720]   Yes, yes.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.440]   And I would say most people will get that number wrong. So it's one thing to say,
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.520]   "I wish I had money at the bottom of the pandemic to invest." It was another thing
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:39.520]   when the market was down 15% to either say, "Okay, now's the time." When is the time to
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.400]   actually do that is another challenge with that approach.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.760]   Yeah. I think it's like, "What's your capability of timing the market?" Because timing the market
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.160]   is very, very hard to do.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.400]   I will say maybe a slightly modified version is if your dollar cost averaging, if you're like,
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.200]   "I have $100,000 to put in the market over the next six months, and a month from now, the market
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:04.800]   is down 10%," well, maybe you can accelerate your strategy and just put the rest of it in the
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.960]   market. You're not necessarily keeping it all on the sidelines just for that purpose. But if you're
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:15.680]   already in the middle of deploying money, maybe that's a time you could accelerate how quickly
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:21.200]   you're doing it. I remember I had a chunk of money to invest, and my rule was like,
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:28.480]   "I'm going to put in X amount a month, but any time the market in any given day is down by more
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.360]   than 2%, I'm just going to rein in one of those months and do it today."
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:39.120]   Yeah. I think it's a lot about what can you do. You want a strategy that you can actually follow
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:46.480]   and that you feel good about. And if you feel good about getting a bargain by investing on down days
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:54.720]   or investing when the market goes down 10%, it's not going to hurt you, I think, unless you're
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.400]   having money out of the market for a long time, waiting for the crash that never comes.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.400]   What would you say to someone who's listening to this conversation, is excited to dial things in,
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:10.000]   but just is an over-optimizer and is having analysis paralysis about picking the right,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.080]   perfect portfolio? Yeah. I think once you can
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:24.080]   dial in what the appropriate risk is and what the right balance between
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.360]   equities and bonds and come to some basic asset allocation, then I would say there's
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.560]   always opportunity to add complexity on top of the strategy later.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:47.360]   I think you don't want to put yourself in a situation where you're not confident in your
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:52.800]   investment strategy, which would cause you to potentially sell when it goes down because you
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.840]   don't really believe in it. But if you can get across that threshold where you think you're
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:05.440]   in something you can believe in, then starting simple sounds like a great way to get going.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.120]   And then if you want to continue to do research about tax loss harvesting, tax aware allocation,
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.960]   and potentially add that complexity on later, that seems like a good approach.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:23.280]   Yeah. I want to caution people not to make perfect the enemy of good here. I think that
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:30.000]   if you're on the fence between whether you should be in a 65/35 or a 70/30 portfolio
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   and it takes you a year to dial in that decision, you probably would have been
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.080]   better off in either of them. Or start with the less risky one.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:47.840]   If you think you may not have the tolerance for the 70%, start with the lower risk version of it.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:53.680]   Yeah. My challenge has always just been there's no perfect answer. You could take a million risk
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.680]   scores and they'd give you a million different... Not a million, but you'd get a lot of different
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:03.360]   allocation amounts. At the end of the day, you just have to pick one that feels right,
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:10.240]   knowing that either direction for any of the assets in your portfolio could do better or worse.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:18.880]   But a 70/30 and a 75/25 portfolio are going to be pretty correlated to each other.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.680]   Even though they're not going to be perfectly correlated, they're going to be pretty correlated.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.440]   And you will never know which one was actually the better one for a given period of time.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.560]   Yeah. And you're making a choice by not being invested or being all in cash. You're making
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.960]   that your portfolio instead. Yeah, which is definitely not your portfolio.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.120]   So it's also a choice you're making. And you're like, "Well, is that the right one?" Because
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:47.360]   you should think about what is the best one that you know now.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.960]   Yeah. And to your point about complexity, even if that complexity... You can always
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:55.680]   add complexity. You can also always change it. If you decide you want to dial up the amount of
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:01.120]   equities you have, great. You can do that. You can change this over time. So finding something that
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:07.680]   feels good is great. For me, I think I have a four-fund portfolio. And I was like, "I just want
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:16.160]   them at 40/30/20/10." I felt really good about them all being very even numbers. No rationale
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:23.360]   there. It could have had 38, 40, whatever those numbers... I'm going to do the math right.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:30.720]   I could have had 38, 22, 30, and 10. Those all would have also summed up to 100, I think.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:37.440]   Double-check my math if you want. And I just feel good about it. I know it sounds crazy, but
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.640]   the difference between all these numbers got me caught up in thinking, "Gosh, I don't know if it
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.560]   should be this or this or this." So I just picked round numbers. And I was okay with that decision,
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.600]   even if it's not... Some other person's algorithm would have spit out a more optimal allocation.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.560]   It just felt easy for me to look at and manage if I always knew that they were simple round numbers.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.080]   Yeah. Makes sense. I think having something you can have confidence in and stick with
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.880]   if the market's down or up is probably one of the most important pieces.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.680]   Yeah. And so if people do need someone to talk about it, and maybe they have a spouse that's
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:13.840]   not interested, I'm curious how you think about in light of the world now. When we were starting our
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:19.360]   company, there was no chat GPT. There were no other models you could have a conversation with
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.240]   about things like this. And so we built something that was a hybrid of software and human financial
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:29.200]   advisors. Human financial advisors still exist. If you're struggling to make these decisions,
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.120]   might make sense to work with one. I think the advice I would give, which is probably I assume
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:39.120]   is yours, is work with someone who has your best interest at heart. Work with a fiduciary.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:45.920]   And understand that there is a difference between a financial planner who can help you think through
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.040]   planning and investing decisions and an investment manager. And so there are lots of people out there
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:56.080]   that can help you come up with a portfolio that can help you think about how much to invest,
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.400]   what to invest, that you don't need to pay an ongoing fee to manage your portfolio. You could
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:06.960]   pay a financial planning fee, but not a 1% of AUM assets under management fee on an ongoing basis.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:12.240]   I don't know. Without going down a whole episode about picking a financial advisor in general,
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:15.360]   you could... Anything you would say about picking one?
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:25.280]   Yeah. I think picking advisors who's a fiduciary, who has experience working with clients in your
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:33.920]   general situation is a great place to start. And I think they're people with their own experiences.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.360]   So I think interviewing them and interviewing a few of them and seeing this one you get along
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:44.000]   with, agree with their philosophy is the right thing to do if you want to work with someone.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.240]   And what about AI here? Because I know you've been working on a lot of this in your lab and
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:53.680]   thinking about language models. Could you get a lot of what you get out of working with a financial
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:00.000]   advisor just by having a conversation about your portfolio with chat GPT, perplexity, whatever
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:09.600]   model you want? Maybe in the future. Right now, there's the hallucination problem where
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:19.040]   if you're relying on the model to give a good investment portfolio, it could just make up
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.200]   something. It could make up data. It could make up rationales. So I think there's a lot of...
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.920]   There's a lot of caution that would be needed. I think if you're
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:35.040]   using it to bounce around ideas and want feedback, but are not going to make any
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:40.400]   decisions based on it, maybe you could convince it to talk about it with you.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:50.400]   But I think there are a lot of innovations that are happening on the model side themselves that'll
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:57.200]   be really interesting and lead to really interesting financial products in the future.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:04.960]   For example, one of the approaches to improving the hallucination problem is this strategy called
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:13.920]   retrieval augmented generation or RAG, where the idea is given the question, can it integrate
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:23.040]   information from documents into what it analyzes and how it gives an answer?
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:31.040]   So maybe it could give a footnote about why it thinks this investment could be good or this
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.760]   portfolio could be good or why you should do something in this circumstance. There's also
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:45.440]   opportunity to not just have a one prompt. You send one message and it sends one message back.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:51.440]   It's an opportunity to chain the outputs of the language model together and say, "Okay,
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:59.680]   well, the first prompt could be a set of ideas that it then goes and explores and then comes
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.960]   back and it writes a summary for you." I think there's a lot of innovations that will make these
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:13.120]   things more useful and more accurate in the future that I think is going to be a huge advantage for
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.160]   people who don't necessarily want to hire a financial advisor, but want to
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.960]   collect information in a lot better way than a Google search.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:29.600]   Yeah. I'd push back a little and say, "I bet if you pull up any AI tool of choice right now and
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.520]   say, 'Hey, I'm trying to think about building an investment portfolio. Can you help me think about
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.160]   what my risk score could be?' You might be able to have a dialogue. Is the answer going to be the
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:44.160]   answer that I would say, trust it and execute it? No. Ask two or three different AIs a few different
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:50.320]   questions. If everything seems to get you to the same point and you look at other portfolios online
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.880]   that people show in lazy portfolios or whatever, and you look at what the portfolio wealth front
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.480]   or betterment would spit out and you're all in the same ballpark and you got something you feel
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:04.640]   good about, it could be a good thought partner as long as you're using other sources to check."
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:10.320]   Yeah. I think it can provide insight into what types of things you can be thinking about.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:18.480]   But I think I'd be hesitant to rely on the output. Yeah. At this point.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:24.480]   This has been awesome. I miss these conversations. Chris and I used to stay up late when we had no
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.040]   children and debate all of these things because we were thinking about how we build it for clients.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:32.320]   So I'm really excited we got to do it again. Yeah. Thanks so much for having me.
