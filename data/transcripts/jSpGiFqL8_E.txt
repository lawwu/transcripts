[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   Do we have freeberg? Is he did he drop off for here? He's free
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.200]   birds back. Okay. Three, I just had to take a leak. I just I go
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.960]   outside my office and I come back. Oh, you like a nature pee?
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.920]   You're a nature guy. Me too. I love a great nature. I have this
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.680]   great office at home, which is like a building outside of my
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.560]   house. So I like to go in the garden. Take a breath of fresh
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   air and just you don't sit down to pee. No, I'm serious. I'm not
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.720]   joking around you guys. So many jokes. I'm not going there.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.680]   That's a soy estrogen boy joke. Is that no, we can cut this out.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.640]   But my pediatrician said, H mom, I think it's really important
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.480]   to teach your boys to pee sitting down. And even free for
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.920]   you as you get older. Are you talking about good for that?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920]   It's good for the prostate. And there's like a materially
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.720]   different percentage in terms of prostate cancer rates when you
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.160]   pee sitting down because you expel all the pee that just kind
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.120]   of gets caught there. What a little the dribble swear to God
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.640]   bro. I swear to God. You're about to do it. Wait, wait,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.720]   what about a shake? Nick, you can cut all of this. No, the
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.600]   shake. This is great. Sitting while you're needing aids and
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.160]   muscle relaxation, benefiting men with tight pelvic floor
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   muscles, or symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Sitting to
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.640]   pee enhances stability. Falls minimizes messiness, especially
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.360]   for whenever sacks gets a new home. He puts urinals in that's
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.600]   how much of a man he is. How does your staff? How does your
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.880]   staff hold your body while you pee? Like do they hold you?
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.560]   History of the world. Mel Brooks. This study is like the
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.080]   vasectomy truck at the DNC. I mean, it's meant to emasculate
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.840]   men. That's the only interpretation of it. It's
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:02:01.600]   total nonsense. Rain man David. All right. The Labor Department
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.440]   has revised down the job growth numbers as a number of members
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.800]   of this panel predicted the BLS updated its non farm payroll
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.400]   stats downgrading actual job growth to around 30% versus what
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   was originally reported. This means the US economy created
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.840]   around 818,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months leading up to
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.600]   March 2024. Number was originally reported as 2.9
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.520]   million new jobs created and it's more like 2.1. The Labor
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   Department updates and revises its stats frequently it gives
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.160]   disclaimers but this is the largest and most significant
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.680]   revision since 2009 after the Great Recession and so the
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.600]   biggest downgrade came in the field not surprisingly of
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.000]   professional and business services with 358,000 jobs lost
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.200]   over the last year we see that in all the stats of different
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.680]   tech companies and businesses finance companies doing layoffs
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.960]   other fields that revise their numbers leisure hospitality
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.920]   manufacturing retail makes sense and a little bit in
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   transportation. Here's a couple charts for you before we go and
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   get some feedback. civilian unemployment rate seasonally
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.920]   adjusted. As you can see, since the great financial crisis, we
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   went from 10% all the way down to well below four and that's
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   where we sit today. USA Today chart here of gains and losses
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.800]   since 1980. Obviously that massive drop you see there of
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.760]   minus 9.3 million jobs was coded with the big quick rebound of
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.440]   7.3. So overall, the country's in great shape. Saks your
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.960]   thoughts on the revision, you obviously made note of this when
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.040]   we went through the numbers.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.160]   Well, yeah, I mean, I predicted this, this would happen. And I
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.960]   didn't know exactly how we would get the correction. But now it's
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.000]   come out. By the way, it's not just the this 818,000 jobs. If
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.080]   you look at the last 12 months out of all the restatements,
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.840]   it's been something like 1.2 million, I can share the chart
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.080]   on that. But this is quite remarkable. About a year ago, I
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.240]   tweeted really fairly casually that there was a hot jobs
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.840]   report. This is around June of 2023. That I didn't know where
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.280]   they're finding all these jobs. I mean, all I see is layoffs.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.400]   That was my reaction based on not just what I was seeing in
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.880]   tech and all of us, you know, especially last year, we're
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.120]   seeing nothing but layoffs in tech. It was also feedback from
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.400]   real estate investors that I knew. I mean, all new real
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.280]   estate projects have basically stopped because the cost of
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.600]   borrowing was so high, and there was a credit crunch. So new
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.160]   construction projects had stopped reifies were very hard
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.080]   to get. It's just that everywhere I was looking in the
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.280]   economy, and the feedback I was getting from people, things
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.800]   looked pretty dismal. And yet the media was continuously
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.440]   putting out stories about hot jobs reports. And we've been
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.800]   getting this now for roughly a year. And then what happens is
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.120]   that there's a revision, and the revisions have always gone in
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.920]   one direction. They're always revision down. I mean, if the
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.960]   revisions were completely sort of neutral and arbitrary, you'd
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.360]   expect it to be like a coin flip, you know, you might have
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.080]   10 revisions and five would be up and five be down, but they've
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.440]   all been down. Yeah. So what I saw was a pattern of revisions
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.600]   down. And now we've seen the biggest one. So it's not
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.560]   altogether surprising to me. And in hindsight, you know, when I
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.680]   tweeted that a year ago, I got this like hysterical reaction. I
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.200]   mean, like, it was one of these tweets that all of a sudden,
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.440]   everyone's like, quote, tweeting and telling me to stay in my
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.040]   lane. I'm a VC, and I don't know the numbers. And it was like, I
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.480]   hit some sort of nerve. And you know, whenever that happens,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.520]   you're usually over the target in some way.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.640]   Yeah. And it's generating, it's triggering people is what you're
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.080]   saying? Yeah.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.800]   Yeah. So the question is, like, why were they so triggered? And
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.200]   I think the reason is that on some level, people were
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.320]   intuiting that the numbers didn't really make sense. It
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.680]   didn't really match up with what we're seeing in the economy. And
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.720]   now a year later, we have the proof of that.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.760]   So Chamath, let me go to you next, because you you pointed
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.680]   out that these numbers seemed a little frugalsi fugazi. But we
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.440]   have 162 million people record employed in the country. This
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.560]   number, if it's 162, you take out 800 161. This is what the
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.400]   Fed was been trying to do to cool off inflation, right, we
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.200]   needed to see a little bit less employment. And that's part of
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.720]   it. So I guess the silver lining here is if we are revising these
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   numbers down, that would give more of an indication that
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.760]   we've slowed the economy, correct?
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.440]   Yeah, I mean, I think the economy is a lot slower than
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.760]   what people thought, which, to your point, the silver lining is
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.360]   that it probably now tips the balance of action in September
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.240]   to a cut. And if it was 25 basis points, there's probably going
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.560]   to be a lot of folks lobbying the Fed to cut 50. And I think
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.000]   that they probably have enough numerical justification now to
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.320]   cut 50. I think the bigger problem, though, is if you don't
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.000]   have an accurate sense of where employment really is, and sacks
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.640]   did mention this, you will also then have an inaccurate sense of
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.240]   where GDP is. And I think the one to punch could be very
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.360]   problematic. I think what we're learning more than anything else
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.400]   is we have a very sophisticated economy. We have a very
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.000]   sophisticated capital market system. We have very
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.280]   sophisticated actors in those markets, all of us included, who
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.800]   can react to real time data and make the right decisions. The
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.600]   problem is we have bad data. And the bad data, I think, is
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.920]   something that is fixable. But we need to make an effort to do
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.720]   it because it's insane that the largest and most sophisticated
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.560]   economy in the world is this unpredictable. And I think
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.160]   that's like the big question that I have, which is how is it
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.400]   possible in 2024, that we haven't just made this a
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.040]   priority to fix this. And with all of the systems that exist,
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.520]   and all of the SAS tools that exist, and everything that's
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.280]   used to like hire and fire and pay people, we don't have an
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.520]   accurate sense of this number.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.240]   And it could easily show ma that's a real head scratcher to
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.400]   me. This could easily be crowdsourced, or we could pull
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.520]   data from a lot of different places. Obviously, they pull
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   some data from employment roles. But I remember you had a
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.800]   startup, I can't remember the name of it. But you had
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.640]   crowdsourced, people were going around and taking pictures of
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.360]   the price of tomatoes in different places, and then
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.640]   putting it into a database and organizing, I think, hedge funds
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   and other folks. Yeah,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.200]   yeah. So what that company did was it was an agent that you
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.560]   would download on your phone. And we would task you to go and
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.800]   collect certain kinds of information. And yeah, there
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.200]   was some socio economic data that was collected. A lot of it
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.360]   now is with three letter agencies, and the like. So
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.000]   without getting into details, that company's doing quite well,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.520]   but it's just moved in a different direction. If you just
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.000]   created some kind of like a DARPA challenge, like equivalent
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.960]   to this, give it to strike, give it to gusto, give it to a
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.400]   handful of these smart companies to give a guesstimate and see
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.440]   who accurately predicts this number over the course of a year
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   or two. That's more reliable, and frankly, more useful to the
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   market than what the BLS is doing. My first job out of
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.960]   college, by the way, was not in tech, but it was in finance, I
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   was a derivatives trader. And what was so incredible is I
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.040]   remember sitting at my desk in front of my terminal on the
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.760]   trading floor, when nonfarm payrolls would hit, and people
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.480]   would just go crazy. There would just be literally 10s or
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.320]   hundreds of billions of dollars that would start flying back and
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.040]   forth, based on what that number was. And now, to think about that
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.760]   much velocity in a totally random way, because those
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.600]   numbers aren't reliable, it seems just crazy.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.280]   Okay, free bird. Here's a chart for you to comment on maybe we
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.800]   open the aperture here. Total employment and unemployment here
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.200]   in the United States, as you can see, you know, since the 80s,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.440]   population has grown, and the number of people employed has
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.560]   continued to grow labor participation, it kind of peaked
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.680]   in the 90s in the Clinton era, and it's come down a bit since
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.560]   then. But overall, what do you think of the health of the
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.720]   economy, and employment?
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.520]   I mean, I think the Fed target is 4%, which is kind of where
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.480]   we're at, I think we're at 4.2, or 4.3 now. And so the Fed tries
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:55.640]   to balance inflation, unemployment and rates. That's
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.080]   kind of the three things that they're looking at. So they make
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.040]   adjustments to rates. Obviously, if you take rates too low, too
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.760]   fast, you have an increase in inflation. So they're targeting
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.600]   inflation is 2%, they're targeting unemployment 4%. So if
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.760]   you take rates too high, you can certainly reduce inflation, but
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   then the economy can contract or slow down and job cuts start to
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.520]   come through. So now, with inflation kind of supposedly
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.360]   approaching 2%, and unemployment over 4%, the market, if you look
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.320]   at the trading markets, they are now estimating a 100% chance of
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:42.600]   a three quarter of a percent rate cut by the end of 2024. And
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.240]   a 70% chance of a one point rate cut by the end of 2024. So the
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.040]   question is, are they going to do three quarter point cuts by
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.200]   the end of the year? Are they going to do a 50 basis point cut
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.960]   and then a 25 or 50 and a 50? The next couple of weeks, we'll
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   determine which direction and then obviously, Chairman Powell
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.920]   has his big speech happening on Friday.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.440]   Fribourg, what are the what is the betting market say for
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.680]   specifically for September?
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.440]   50 or 75% chance of a quarter point cut 20% chance of a 50
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.840]   basis point cut. And then 6% chance of no cut, which is kind
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.960]   of strange, because the the trading markets, this is
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.400]   obviously a prediction market, but the trading markets are
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.280]   showing effectively 100% chance of a three quarter point cut by
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.080]   the end of 24.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.640]   And sacks, here's the dramatic Fed, we always talked about
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.640]   them kind of getting on this a little bit late. But you can see
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.440]   here, man, what a ramp up in 2022, where we were basically at
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.800]   a quarter point, and they just added a quarter point or 50
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.720]   bips, all the way up to 5.33. Where we've been flat inflation,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.640]   obviously, we have the two handle now. So now we start the
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.320]   process of going down. And I think people generally believe
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.760]   25 bips at a time will be their pattern coming down. You think
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.960]   that seems wise?
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.480]   Well, I think the Fed isn't sure that inflation is a solved
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.120]   problem. I mean, I think that Powell is a little bit reticent
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.120]   to start the rate cutting cycle, because he doesn't know for
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.320]   sure if inflation could tick back up. This first cut is in a
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.640]   way the most important one, because it signals a regime
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.760]   change that we're beginning the rate cut cycle. And what he
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.920]   doesn't want to do is cut any amount, and then be proven
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.720]   wrong, and we get a bad inflation report. And then all
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.520]   of a sudden, he has to raise it again. So he doesn't want to be
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.800]   caught in that position. But I do think that the economy is
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.160]   obviously showing significant weakness. Inflation is not
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.360]   completely solved, but it's down to 2.9%. At least it has a two
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.000]   handle on it now. And so yeah, I think the market is pricing in
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.200]   these rate cuts for a reason.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.600]   So either mission accomplished, or we'll see if we have a soft
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   landing, hard landing or something in between. Most
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.480]   people feel like it's going to be soft with a little bit of
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.080]   bumps. It seems
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.360]   to me in I mean, now that we know that the jobs picture was
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.960]   inflated by 1.2 million jobs over the last, call it roughly a
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.600]   year or 14 months. I think we know that this is not like a
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.880]   perfectly soft landing. I mean, I think that the economy is a
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.920]   little bit shaky, and it's being propped up by massive amounts of
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.480]   government spending, like we talked about, on a previous
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.360]   episode, we're running unsustainably high levels of
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.400]   deficit and debt, we're running what $2 trillion a year deficits
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   right now. And what are we getting for that we're not
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.840]   getting a super robust economy, we're getting an economy that's
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.440]   narrowly staying out of recession. So it's a little bit
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.720]   of a scary picture, I think, that the economy is is so shaky,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.640]   and we're spending so much money to prop it up. And we'll just
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.880]   have to see what happens.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.480]   Yeah. And it doesn't seem like either of the incoming
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.160]   administrations really cares about spending. Seems like we're
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.640]   going to be in still big money spending mode, independent of
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.880]   who wins. We'll see how long that can last as a country. And
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.240]   then we talked a little bit about the Supreme Court decision
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:15.320]   last year, around affirmative action. And it turns out now MIT
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.840]   has released their data, it's getting a lot of buzz online.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   Here's a chart. Basically, what you can take from this chart,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.520]   and this is people self identifying at MIT. And the buzz
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.840]   is that Asian Americans have gone from 41% to 47%. And those
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:38.760]   gains came on a percentage basis from a decline in the number of
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.120]   black and Latino students coming in. Here's the chart, as you can
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.960]   see. So people are wondering about, I guess, the fairness of
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.240]   this. And I guess you could have either one of two positions
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.640]   Chamath, Asian students were being penalized for a long time.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.400]   Or now, I guess you could believe that Latin and black
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.280]   students are being impacted negatively about this. So I'm
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.720]   not sure what your take is. But it's obviously moving to more of
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.760]   a meritocracy, according to the people at MIT.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.080]   It's not even clear how they were making decisions before, nor
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.040]   now. But you know, I tweeted about this yesterday, I think
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.400]   the thing that matters more than anything else, is to make sure
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.200]   that the people that they are letting in, are in love and
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.560]   obsessed with the things that MIT is supposed to be great at.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.320]   So, if you are a great creative thinker, designer architect, you
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.880]   should be at RISD. I'm just I'm giving an example. If you are a
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.440]   great musician, you should be at Juilliard, you should not be
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.080]   going to MIT because you think it's a checkmark, you should be
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.200]   going there because you think that there are professors in
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   organic chemistry in physics in these disciplines that are
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.520]   really important, who are experts in their fields that you
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.160]   can learn from and become an expert yourself. And I think the
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.720]   problem with all of this other stuff is, once you make it a
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.600]   credential, there are some folks that are only going to MIT
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.160]   because they could get in and because it's a great credential
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.000]   in their minds. And they shouldn't go there either. So I
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.760]   think the thing is, you have to get back to what matters, which
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.160]   is, there are all of these industries that have not
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.800]   progressed that much. And in order for those industries to
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.200]   advance, you need really talented young people who can
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.360]   learn and apprentice and then take over. And I think MIT is
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   one of these rare places that focuses on this part of the
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   physical world that hasn't had as much progress. And so I just
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   want to make sure that the people that go there actually
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.280]   want to be there for that reason, gender, race, all that
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.760]   other stuff shouldn't matter.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.880]   And that is what the Supreme Court decision did, you cannot
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.720]   take race into account. Harvard had some weird thing, Friedberg
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.680]   where personality was one of the vectors.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.440]   And sorry, Harvard, I would say that no offense to everybody at
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.720]   Harvard, but like, Harvard is more of a pure credential. Like
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.440]   MIT, I buy more that you go there for certain kinds of
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.080]   specializations. Caltech, you go there for certain
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.760]   specializations. If you're really into wine, you go to UC
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.080]   Davis, my point is, these schools exist for reasons other
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.440]   than just as a collector coin that you put in your pocket. I'm
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.240]   not sure Harvard is really known for anything other than for
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.440]   being, quote, unquote, elite. But even that's questionable
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:50.240]   now. But in the technical areas, I really do think that that MIT
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.360]   was an important place where people would go to train. And I
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   just want to make sure whoever they're letting in actually
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.560]   cares about the thing they're studying.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.080]   Friedberg, what's your take on this? You know, moving back to a
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:06.560]   meritocracy and a colorblind application process? Not being
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.160]   able to use race in admissions?
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:16.200]   I don't think that someone's genetics should determine
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:22.760]   whether or not they go to a school. And I think that their
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.360]   socioeconomic background, experience set, values,
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.440]   successes, failures, are the things that they could have
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.120]   affected or that I think probably better define whether
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.960]   we want to take a moral stance on giving other people
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.280]   opportunities. So I think that that's a kind of good and
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.600]   reasonable place for us to end up.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   Sachs, any thoughts for you, from you on this?
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.480]   Well, I mean, I support the idea of colorblind meritocracy. I
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.240]   mean, I agree with Chamath and Friedberg that the traits that
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.160]   you're born with are not skills or qualifications. They're just
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.280]   the accidents of your birth. And what we should try to create
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.440]   is a society where those things don't matter. And everyone has
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.400]   the same ability and opportunities for advancement
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.200]   based on how hard they work and their skills and this concept of
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.560]   merit. And I think that's when core decision gets us closer
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.240]   to that. Remember that the reason why that Supreme Court
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.840]   decision happened or what the plaintiffs were arguing is that
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.640]   the previous regime on college campuses was unfairly
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.080]   discriminating against Asian Americans. Because whenever you
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.480]   try to engineer the classes to a certain proportion of the
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.760]   population, somebody has to win and somebody has to lose. And
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.640]   the students who are losing were Asian Americans. And in many
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.200]   cases, these Asian Americans were first generation immigrants
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.840]   or they were coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. And
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.360]   yet their population was engineered to a smaller number
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.760]   than merit would otherwise suggest. And now you're seeing
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.800]   it in this new class at MIT, the percentage of Asian Americans
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.080]   has increased somewhat. So I think it's good. I mean, we're
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.440]   reducing a form of discrimination. That
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.120]   discrimination may have originally started for good
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.600]   reasons, to try and create a remedy against a different kind
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.800]   of historical discrimination. Nonetheless, it discriminated
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.320]   against talented Asian students. And I think now that that's
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.760]   been that's been fixed. What do you guys think about creating a
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.800]   leg up for people that came from a disadvantaged
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:41.000]   socioeconomic background? So put race aside. But you know, an
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.520]   individual that grew up in a difficult circumstance, that
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.320]   didn't have the privilege of going to a good school or having
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.160]   a good education, worked hard, tried, but didn't end up with
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.440]   the best test scores or didn't end up with the best GPA. Because
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.600]   of the conditions they were born into. Do you think it's
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.640]   appropriate to give those individuals a leg up in the
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.080]   application process, putting race aside, but just call it
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.440]   socioeconomic disadvantages?
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.000]   To some degree, I do. I mean, look, if you have a student who
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.360]   who gets a four, let's call it a 1450 on the SAT. But they've
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.320]   got tutors and classes. Yep. And they're growing up and they
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.800]   went to school and they went to school in Atherton, right?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.480]   They're getting the best teachers, the best schools, the
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.040]   best environment. And then you take a kid who grew up in, I
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.240]   don't know, like a dangerous part of the inner city, where
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.560]   there's shootings happening, or a rural district with no
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.280]   education, Appalachian, Appalachia, both both are kind
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.440]   of equivalently disadvantaged or different differently, but
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.320]   both disadvantaged. Yep, right. They don't have access to the
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.000]   the best schools, best or best funded schools, best teachers.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And let's say that person gets a 1400 on their SAT, which one
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.880]   is better? I mean, if certainly if they got a 1450, and you're
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.680]   comparing two equal scores, it's really clear that the
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.640]   disadvantaged student probably has more raw talent.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.720]   Totally. I 100% agree. And I feel like I feel like we've used
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.400]   race as a heuristic for that conditional background. And
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.160]   that's what makes it hard because race is not necessarily
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.480]   it's certainly there's a correlation, but it's not
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.800]   necessarily indicative of the socio economic disadvantage
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.760]   that someone may have faced and had to overcome in order to
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.160]   perform and succeed at the level that they could have given
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.440]   their conditions. And so I certainly think that the
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.800]   incorporation of one's socio economic background should be a
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.840]   critical part of the application process. And it's certainly in
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.960]   the same in the job setting. Ultimately, I think I think what
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.720]   would be much more valuable than all of this is for companies to
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.040]   hire from a whole bunch of different schools than they do
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:46.360]   today. And to break the back of this elitist culture we have
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.400]   around certain schools, all of the things that you guys are
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:56.280]   talking about, to me, sound kind of crazy. And the reason is
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:01.000]   because you could go to Iowa State, or you could go to
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.800]   Harvard. And you could make a claim and I would buy it that in
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.040]   some random social science, maybe there's an advantage in
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.160]   the people that you meet. But there's not necessarily an
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.120]   advantage for studying physics at any of these two schools.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.520]   It's not like one's teaching you that gravity goes up and the
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.920]   other teaches you that gravity goes down. So I think the bigger
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:29.400]   problem is that we don't value enough these fundamentally
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.280]   important skills that we need for humanity to evolve. And
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.040]   number two, we have fallen to this trap of saying that these
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.920]   schools, these highly credentialed schools that cost
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:44.200]   60 and 70 and $80,000 a year, graduate the best kids. And I
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.360]   don't think that that's true either. So the thing that we
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.640]   could all do, because we're all hirers, we hire 1000s of people
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.920]   is we should be going to all kinds of different schools.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.960]   Today, I just gave an offer to a guy that went to Virginia Tech.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:04.840]   And this kid seems awesome. kick ass. And when we put out
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.960]   job postings for 8090, we veer towards the schools that are
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.760]   like hardcore technical places, where none of all of this random
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.200]   credentialed nonsense gets in the way. And so they're hungrier
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.840]   as a result, they're more earnest, and you can cut through
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.440]   the BS. The other thing I would say is that it's even more
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.760]   capable now of getting through the filter of these credentials
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.320]   and knowing the quality of a person, you can look at GitHub
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.880]   repos, if you're a developer, you can look at all of these
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.280]   things that allow you to understand. So I don't know, I
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.640]   disagree with your guys's thing of like, let's go figure out all
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.360]   these other things. How about we stop hiring and valuing? I
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.040]   think randomly non specific degrees, just because they come
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.440]   from a good school. Well, I think that would go a long way.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.080]   Because we do still have a college application process,
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.360]   Chamath. So there are still going to be a set of criteria
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.960]   used to determine whether or not our kids end up getting into a
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.400]   specific school if we and they all kind of say, hey, it makes
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.520]   sense. But I'm saying if your son or daughter were to go and
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.880]   study computer science at North Carolina State, the biggest
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.120]   thing that that you could do is be okay with it. Another example
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.200]   of a school that does a great job of recruiting from
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.480]   nontraditional places. I would I not be okay with it? No, no,
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.280]   this is my point. I think it's a decision. I'm saying that I'm
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.800]   not saying that you are, but I'm saying that if you make it a
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.560]   big deal that North Carolina State is somehow worse than some
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.160]   other credentialed school, because our social cohort says
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.320]   that those other schools are better. We're part of the
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.880]   problem. Well, in my work cohort, North Carolina State's
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.720]   a great school, we hire a ton of people. So that's a great
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.520]   school, actually,
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.320]   to be honest, I think schools like that are better. I mean, I
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.440]   think probably Virginia Tech is better than Harvard. And the
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.320]   reason is because they're less infected with woke de ideology
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.440]   that now pervades these like top schools. So the students are
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.040]   more likely to learn something.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.680]   Well, you should stop saying top. They're not top schools.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.880]   They're not top schools anymore. They're not the smartest kids.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.280]   They're not the hardest working kids. So we should stop saying
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.000]   top schools. These Ivy League schools are not the top schools.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.880]   I agree with that.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.080]   Yeah, there might be the most notable schools historically,
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.720]   but they're not necessarily the ones that are the biggest
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.440]   brands. And they're not new brands, they're old brands. And
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.320]   we've seen that these old brands depreciate over time. And people
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.520]   read way too much into them.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:32.920]   I think the structural monopoly is that they then get and have
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.160]   the most capital, which they can then use to build facilities
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.680]   and support staff that can come and do core research. And so you
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.640]   then get all these research staff in particularly in
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.880]   technical fields in science and medical fields, and so on, that
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.280]   want to come and be on campus. And that then creates the
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.280]   network effect of undergrads getting a better education
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.000]   because they're getting exposed to the best talent in the kind
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.160]   of I don't necessarily think they don't actually think that
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.600]   benefits the undergrads. I mean, first of all, these campuses
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.440]   will tell us about your experience at Stanford, I think
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.720]   you're the only Ivy Leaguer here.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.840]   You went to Berkeley, that's
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.760]   not in the Ivy League. The Ivy League is like an East Coast
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.160]   club, whereas Stanford was kind of the West Coast disruptor.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.920]   I mean, I know when I worked when I went to Berkeley, I
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.160]   worked at Lawrence Berkeley labs, I got to be exposed to
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.240]   Nobel laureates, it was actually, like, I think,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.960]   particularly my field, like I majored in astrophysics and
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.280]   physics, like, that was a great school to get exposure, and you
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.680]   actually had that opportunity. I think that's part of the
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.160]   challenge schools with really great graduate programs and
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.200]   research that goes on on campus, actually can give a better
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.680]   educational experience to the undergrads. It's almost like
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.320]   you're getting these internships and these fellowships, and
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.880]   these TAs and professors.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   Well, that's a different thing. I actually think what America
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.600]   needs is what I benefited from at the University of Waterloo,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.920]   which is an active and vibrant co op program. Yeah. So yeah, I
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.240]   do really disagree with you. I don't think that there is a
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.560]   incredibly better way to teach thermodynamics. I think that's
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.480]   a bit of a joke. Okay. I think that that's it. That's why we
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.640]   tell ourselves talking about applied work tomorrow. So I'm
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.480]   talking about you go up to Lawrence Berkeley lab, and you
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.440]   work in an actual lab that does a lot of interesting research.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.600]   Okay, so my point is, if we both agree that you're a great
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.320]   mental sciences, definitely. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.960]   pointing out. So then like the universities in America that
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.120]   have these co op programs, I think are incredible
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.600]   institutions. Again, they're not the typical ones are places
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.880]   like Drexel and other places. But now you allow these kids to
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.760]   be in the trenches with people building things. And I just
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.440]   think that that's an incredible gift for them. But it's also an
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   incredible opportunity for these organizations to understand the
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.320]   quality of the person beyond some credential. Well, I do
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.400]   think in a digital era, core education has commoditized. And
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.360]   I think most people can get most of the way there without
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.720]   necessarily paying 60 to $80,000 a year, and then being
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.040]   partnered in some way with that on the ground internship or
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.200]   integrated kind of program where you get actual hands on
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.000]   experience. So I don't know, like, I mean, the university
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.080]   model, maybe does not make sense for most fields. J. Cal,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.480]   what do you think? Yeah, it's very interesting. The car did
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.120]   you go to school? I went to Fordham University at night. I
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.800]   got in three weeks before. Did you get an undergrad degree from
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.960]   Fordham? Yeah, Fordham. I was going to either I had taken the
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.040]   New York What was your degree in? What did psychology, I was
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.800]   going to go into the NYPD, I had was about to get accepted at
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.160]   18 years old, 17 years old, 18 years old. And then I decided
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.560]   the last minute to go to Fordham at night had to work in
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.440]   order to pay for it. So it took me four and a half years, but I
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.920]   did like almost a full credit load at night. And then I was
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   going to go into john jay for criminal justice, and get my
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.880]   forensic degree and then join the FBI. So I was in the process
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.520]   of applying to the FBI. And then the internet happened. I
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.360]   started a magazine about the internet, and I went in a
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.800]   totally different direction. But the co op stuff, I remember
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.920]   when we went to Waterloo, we did a speaking gig there years
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.720]   ago, too often. I was very taken with the students there. And
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.120]   like, they're like drive. And so I think that's the key piece.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.280]   And what I did in venture capital, because I needed to
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   have a team of about eight people screening all the
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.920]   companies we get in the applications. So I just made my
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.720]   own training program. And I hire a lot of people in Canada.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.360]   To do it. And basically, they do five meetings a day, they
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.240]   write up coverage, I made an entire framework, and I'm doing
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.880]   professional development. Because I found a lot of the top
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.200]   people from these brand name schools were entitled, they
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.520]   didn't want to do 2535 meetings a week with founders. And I just
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.120]   found these other students from Waterloo and other colleges
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.720]   like that. And I've trained them in my framework for these are
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.160]   the 13 qualities we look for in investing in a startup. And
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.520]   these are the 25 red flags. And I've now got seven people, we
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.560]   did 110 120 meetings one week recently. And so it's just much
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.960]   better to train them ourselves and make your own training
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.560]   program, I believe. And so it's even like Malcolm, didn't
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.680]   Malcolm Gladwell write something which is roughly the equivalent
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:24.200]   of like, you're better off getting the top 10 student at a
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.680]   non IV versus like the 50th student at an IV or something. I
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   don't know, there was like something like maybe, maybe it
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.760]   was like a chapter. And what was his reason? Because of
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.320]   motivation? Yeah, it's like, these kids are excellent. When
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.440]   they're when they're achieving, and they're excelling in things
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.720]   that are not subjective. You want to go get those kids? Yeah,
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.200]   you know,
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.640]   they've performed. Yeah, I mean, I think one of the one of the
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.760]   problems with the whole di policy, whether you want to do
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.520]   it based on race or socioeconomics, or whatever it is
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.040]   that you're doing is, it keeps happening at every layer of the
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.480]   stack. And at some point, you just need to say, look, we've
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.160]   made up for whatever came before. And now it just has to
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.760]   be about that person's performance, we need to stop
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.480]   putting our thumb in the scale, and just hire the best person.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.360]   My view is you could probably do that after undergrad, like
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.920]   there's no need to keep artificially adjusting the
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.720]   weights of how you hire people after undergrad, but yet you
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.560]   have all these like programs that keep trying to make the
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.520]   decision based on something other than merit. And I think
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.600]   that that's the part that needs to stop.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.480]   I mean, we had Coleman Hughes on and, you know, I think he had
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.440]   a very good perspective on it, which is like maybe starting
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.000]   with earlier education is where you could probably solve some
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.080]   of these problems a little bit more effectively.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.320]   I will say, I feel like my experience in the workplace is
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.960]   that one's college or university is completely decoupled from
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.080]   one's performance or ability to succeed in the workplace in an
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.040]   meritocratic workplace. And when I say meritocratic, I mean,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.360]   excluding nepotistic workplace settings, and excluding
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.880]   demographically biased workplace. And if you exclude
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.840]   those two, it honestly does not matter what school someone went
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.400]   to, they could be brilliant, they could be hardworking, they
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.440]   could be passionate, they could be a leader, the school doesn't
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.360]   matter. And in fact, perhaps the corollary is true, which is
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.160]   the people that went to the schools that determine success,
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.200]   generally have a very hard time succeeding in the workplace.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.320]   Because anytime they face failure, it is a challenging
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.360]   circumstance for them that they are unable to overcome. And
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.760]   that's particularly true in entrepreneurship. That's been my
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.320]   experience, perhaps in the broader workplace setting, they
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.120]   could work well, where they're told all the time, if you do
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.920]   this, then you get that they do this, they get that they feel
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.720]   good, they succeed in that model. But in the in the real
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.560]   world, that's not the model. And I think that that's a like a
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.760]   really important fact that's colored my point of view on how
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.720]   the higher education system actually does perform with
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.960]   respect to improving the quality of our workforce in the US.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.800]   Separate to that, I will say that in technical fields, the
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.160]   research environment on certain college campuses can be
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.720]   incredibly, to Chamath's point, opportunistic for getting
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.120]   exposure to hands on work that you might not otherwise get in
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.560]   technical field. So a lot of this comes down to motivation,
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.280]   you know, at a certain point, a person has to be motivated to
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.880]   put in a lot of hours and become excellent at whatever their
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.440]   chosen profession is. I think I talked about it previously, when
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.600]   we started talking about macroeconomics here, I took a
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.760]   macroeconomics course at MIT, on their website, or on YouTube,
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.080]   rather, right? There's incredible that this stuff is
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.720]   all out there. And anybody can take any of these courses for
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.040]   by like the basic, the base education has been commoditized.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.600]   You know, it's the hands on experience that one gets, that
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.640]   makes a huge difference.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:50.360]   MIT 1401 principles in microeconomics, supply and
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.680]   demand. I mean, it was like incredible. And you know, this
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.720]   is stuff I just didn't ever get exposed to. And I was able to do
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.280]   it for free. I listened to the course actually twice, and I
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.880]   took notes on and I really got a lot out of it. All right,
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.440]   listen, more stuff on the docket. Anybody else have final
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.880]   thoughts here? Before we go into the election stuff and
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.680]   taxes,
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.800]   let's all commit to hiring as many people as possible from
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.960]   nontraditional schools. Absolutely. I mean, that's what
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.240]   I do already. I mean, it's it's working. All right, decision
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:23.400]   2024. Get ready for a bit of chaos here, folks. The DNC is
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.080]   underway as we tape. We tape on Thursdays. As you know, I think
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:32.040]   Kamala will give her acceptance speech tonight. DNC pulled out
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.480]   all of their all stars, Michelle Obama, Brock, Hillary, Bill,
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.120]   Clinton, Oprah, and Tim Walz spoke last night, most people
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.480]   felt he had a pretty strong showing. Our guy Nate silver,
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:49.080]   friend of the pod has the election as essentially neck and
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.600]   neck. We're in coin toss territory here. I think it's
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.920]   going to be come down to the debate. Some interest here on
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.920]   my besties thing. Here is the silver bulletin, his new
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.200]   publication. He's not at 538 anymore. Just Kamala at 47
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.520]   Trump at almost 45. And this all will come down to the swing
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.160]   states. I think as we all know, he's got a really great
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.840]   interactive chart over there. He's got Harris with clear
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.480]   leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.640]   Virginia. Think those are about 68 electoral college votes,
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.600]   votes Trump with clear leads in Georgia and Florida, my Lord,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.160]   Florida is 29 or 30 electoral college votes. That's a lot. The
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.120]   toss up states Nevada with the tipping and no tax there, but
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.640]   that's only six North Carolina is been flip flopping back and
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.800]   forth from Harris to Trump, those two are worth 24. So we
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.240]   swung from many paths to victory, basically a certain
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:52.280]   victory for Trump with versus Biden to now a toss up. This is
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.120]   an interesting chart here, sex, I want to get your take on which
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.480]   is the polling averages. I think you said last week or the week
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.000]   before that we would see the Harris bump reverse. And that's
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.720]   exactly what's happened. The month over month change is
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.040]   dramatic, as you see in this table. But the week over week
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.200]   change. So in the month change, you have democrats running the
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.080]   table in all the swing states. And then you look at the weekly
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.880]   change the opposite. In the last week, the republicans have not
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.960]   caught up but made significant gains all between a half a
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.440]   percentage point in a point with the exception of North
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.720]   Carolina, which as I stated earlier, is a toss up your
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.080]   thoughts on the on the election right now, sex, before we get
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.000]   into the issues just on the numbers here.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.920]   Well, the election is gonna be on nail biter, and it's gonna
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:47.000]   really come down to a few 1000 votes or a few 10s of 1000s of
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.680]   votes in swing states. I think we've we've known that now for a
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.520]   while, I would say since Biden abdicated, and they did the hot
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.080]   swap. I think the most interesting poll numbers over
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.560]   the past week, is if you look at Polly market, that is has
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.920]   swung back to Trump being in the lead over the past week, as
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.440]   opposed to Harris last week, I think Harris was favored to win
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.560]   by quite a bit. And you have to ask the question, well, how does
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.240]   this happen during her own democratic convention, which is
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.800]   supposed to be, you know, nothing but a four day
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.160]   infomercial for the democrat candidate. Yes. It's a
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.680]   coronation. So she should be getting nothing but a bump. And
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.560]   instead, it seems to be the opposite. And I think the reason
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.800]   is, is because the more substance her campaign puts out
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.360]   the more policies, it reveals that where she does. First, they
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:43.160]   had her give that economic speech last Friday, on price
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.760]   gouging, and price controls. And we spent a lot of time last
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.880]   week talking about why price controls would be a disastrous
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.280]   economic policy. Subsequent to that, there were stories that
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.520]   came out about her campaign supporting these huge tax hikes
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.720]   that were in the original Biden Harris budget, including a 25%
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.840]   unrealized gains tax, which we can talk more about. Yeah, but I
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.120]   think just to boil it down, I think the more the public
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.480]   learns, the more we learn about what she would do as president,
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   the worse she does. And they've now got to run out the clock for
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.000]   another, I don't know what 7080 days, in terms of running a
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.840]   campaign that substance free, that's just completely on vibes.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.800]   That's about joy, without answering any questions without
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.920]   doing any press interviews. And I think we predicted some time
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.320]   ago that that just was not going to be sustainable, that at some
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.280]   point, they're gonna have to tell us what they think. And as
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.480]   they do that, the more they do that, I think the more her polls
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.360]   will correct. What do you think, Chamath, you trust these
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.680]   betting markets, because there's so much at stake at this
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.440]   election, right? I mean, people are pouring money into both
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.880]   campaigns. It's really contentious, people see it as
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.840]   existential on both sides. And then you have, you know, these
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.640]   prediction markets that, you know, have low 10s of millions
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.080]   or hundreds of millions of dollars being bet. Could these
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:08.360]   not be, you know, influenced you trust them, because we are
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.640]   seeing this is the first time these prediction markets have
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.680]   become a major discussion point, because their businesses,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.400]   obviously. But people are really getting into them. And I
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.400]   wonder if they could be manipulated, or if you think you
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.120]   trust them, I guess is the way I'm asking you, because we've
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.200]   had this discussion a bit offline.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.120]   I mean, I think these are really good businesses, but they
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.520]   are some combination of entertainment and gambling. I
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.400]   don't think that these things are as useful directional
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.560]   indicators, as they are just really interesting businesses
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.080]   that allow people to bet and wager on all kinds of random
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.800]   things. So I would not look to these sites for that
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.280]   necessarily. Okay. I think that people like Nate silver do a
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:02.040]   pretty reasonable job. In his specific case, I think he does a
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.480]   very good job of threading together and doing this meta
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.760]   analysis of polls. But I think we've learned that the that this
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:16.680]   polling is pretty brittle and not super reliable. So the the
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.840]   betting markets are exactly that they're just like it's like
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.080]   sports betting, but just wasn't a betting market. We talked
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.800]   about this two weeks ago, Shapiro was like 80% or
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.640]   something. So yeah, it's fairly obvious, free bird that maybe
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.360]   these betting markets are a little bit entertainment, but
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.360]   maybe directional incorrect, because they also did start to
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.320]   predict the hot swap. You know, so what do you think free bird
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.800]   about these betting markets? Well, I think markets you and we
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.520]   keep everyone keeps trying to reduce this down to some
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.800]   deterministic binary system, which is like it works or it
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.720]   doesn't. And the truth is, that the conditions of the world are
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.880]   changing all the time. The news is changing all the time, people
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.520]   are taking action all the time, there's a shift in current
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.000]   events all the time. As a result, the forecast is changing
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.280]   all the time. And so what a betting market or a poll does is
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.440]   provide a probabilistic forecast of the future, there is a
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.480]   probability of something happening. It is not trying to
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.360]   say I as a poll, or I as a market, am right 100% of the
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.440]   time, or not. It is saying here's the estimated distribution
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.600]   of outcomes in the future. So there is a 20% chance or an 80%
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.840]   chance of Shapiro 20% chance of him not being the case. Turns
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.760]   out that that 20% is where Harris ended up going based on
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.480]   some meeting she had in some room with some group of people
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.600]   that we aren't privy to. And that the market in that case was
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   not privy to what Nate silver does. And I think people need to
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.440]   understand this a little bit. When you gather polling data,
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.640]   that poll has some predictive power, based on how the pollsters
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.760]   conduct their poll, who they call, how they screen candidates
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.680]   for the poll, etc, etc. So different polling companies, it
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.840]   turns out are better or worse at making that directional
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:08.120]   probability bet than others. And what Nate's models do, is
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.920]   they account for the historical performance of different
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.720]   pollsters, and weight them differently to create a
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.040]   basically a multi pole prediction. And so that's what
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.800]   his system is set up to do. And remember, he similarly doesn't
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.240]   give you one outcome, he gives you a distribution of outcomes,
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.280]   I think his simulation model has probably 1000 or 10,000
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.960]   simulations that come out of it. And those simulations, he
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.080]   says, Look, there's a 29% chance of this happening 70%. He's not
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   trying to say, here's what's going to happen. He's trying to
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.960]   give everyone a point of view on the distribution of things
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.000]   happening in the future, just like weather forecasting is not
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.640]   perfectly predictable. It's very predictable for tomorrow, it's
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.880]   less predictable for three days from now. And it's very
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.000]   unpredictable 12 days from now. And that's how these polls also
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.040]   work out. And that's also how these massive mega models of
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.880]   polls and it's also how prediction markets work.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.960]   And freeberg, people have a lot of emotion in these models when
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.720]   it comes to politics. Whereas if you were looking at gambling,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.440]   or the odds of winning a poker hand, we all would be like, oh,
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.800]   you have a 30% chance of winning, or a 10%, or an 8%,
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.840]   you're going to hit two adders.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.280]   There's emotions both way, J. Cal. So basically, when I read
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.760]   those polls, or I read the summary of the polls, I have a
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.520]   bias based on my interest in the outcome that says that thing is
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.840]   BS, that thing is right. Oh, look at this. And everyone
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.560]   points to this stuff for confirmation bias of their
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.480]   opinion. Yeah. And to denounce the other side. And so it all
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.120]   gets caught up as kind of a media angle when people use
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.920]   polling data. And and also fundamentally, when people kind
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.800]   of get involved in polls and create polls, there's also the
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.520]   risk of bias. And part of what Nate silver and others try and
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   do is figure out does that bias come out in the polling
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.480]   performance historically, and that's how they kind of wait,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.880]   whether or not this poll is going to be a better or worse
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.440]   indicator than other polls of the distribution of things that
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.960]   might happen in the future. In fact, if people were to lose,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.360]   you know, a poker hand, that they, you know, were 60% to win
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.480]   or two thirds to win, you know, they would be like, okay, that
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   makes sense. When Hillary Clinton lost to Trump the first
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.200]   time people lost their minds. And he was pretty clear, right?
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.560]   He was, I think, 6535. And people are like, wait, you said
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.440]   it's 65%. Yeah. Your thoughts on just the accuracy of polls
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.520]   generally, and then what you heard here in terms of the
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.280]   the betting markets? How do you look at these two things that
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   are taking up a lot of space right now?
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.600]   Well, I would consider prediction markets to be an
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   additional tool that we should consider side by side with
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.800]   polls. And they both have their pluses and minuses. The
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.920]   advantage of polls is that you're actually talking to real
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.000]   people as opposed to betters. However, they're very dependent
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   on sampling and getting the sampling correct. I mean, most
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.960]   of these polls, talk to maybe 1000 respondents, these are
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.280]   people who are willing to pick up the phone from a unknown
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.840]   number, that right there is probably a huge source of bias,
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.360]   because I don't do that. And then based on that sample,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   they're going to predict how millions and millions of people
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.800]   are going to vote. Well, everything depends on the
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.520]   composition of that sample, which 1000 voters do you talk
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.200]   to? Do you weight them based on likelihood of voting or
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.520]   demographic characteristics, and so on. So the polls can be
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.960]   notoriously inaccurate. We've seen that many times. And
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.600]   that's why there's a margin of error. Sometimes the margin of
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.840]   error is even wrong. So in any event, it's a tool, but it's a
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.640]   tool that almost by definition is going to be wrong because of
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.160]   sampling problems. You look at prediction markets. And it's a
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.280]   totally different type of voting mechanism where betters are
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.560]   willing to put their money where their mouth is. And they've got
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.840]   real skin in the game. And they're able to make a
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.560]   prediction based on their willingness to lose money. Now
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.880]   there can be problems with that, too. Number one, the
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.680]   betting market can be very thin. Sometimes there's just not a
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.160]   lot of money that's trading hands. So I think with a lot of
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.080]   those VP picks, you can move the VP market by putting just a
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.720]   very small amount of money because the market wasn't very
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.520]   liquid. So you have to kind of look at how deep and liquid the
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.280]   prediction market is. And then I'd say second, the issue with
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.240]   prediction markets is they, and this could be an advantage, is
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.560]   they move a lot based on small things because people are just
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.600]   constantly updating their forecast. I would argue that
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.360]   maybe that's an advantage is that you could see the the trend
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.240]   more easily in a prediction market. So, for example,
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.520]   I have some numbers here, too, if you want to hear them $653
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.040]   million in political bets are currently being placed across
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.400]   the top 10 betting markets, and all of the markets on poly
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.360]   market, which includes things outside of politics are 320
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.600]   million. So they are the big fish in this, I think they're
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.480]   the leader, but it's still a very thin amount of money to
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.520]   your point, sex.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.920]   Yeah, I would mostly use the betting markets as a measure of
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.880]   how sentiment is shifting. So for example, on election night,
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.840]   the betting market is going to converge to 100% in favor of one
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.720]   candidate or another, whereas the actual votes are not going
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.440]   to converge to 100%. You could have an election in say,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.800]   Pennsylvania, where one candidate gets 50.1% of the
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.160]   vote, the other candidate gets 49.9, the betting market is
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.440]   going to converge to 100 zero, because it's predicting who's
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.200]   going to win. It's a binary yes or no, as opposed to where the
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.480]   actual vote totals come out. The polling is trying to
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.560]   approximate where the vote tolls are going to come out right
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.960]   with a huge margin of error. So the polls are just are never
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.320]   going to give you as Crispin, decisive an answer as the
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.120]   prediction markets, but the prediction markets can also be
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.160]   wrong, as we've seen, they're only as good as the people
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.280]   making the bets.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.080]   Chamath, where do you put the third category here, which would
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.480]   be the oddsmakers in Vegas, because they're looking at
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.440]   everything. What do you think about the oddsmakers in Vegas?
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.240]   Would you give them any credence?
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.080]   I don't even know why any of this matters. Why are we
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:57.720]   talking about this?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.120]   Well, I mean, because people are looking at the tea leaves.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.600]   There are reasons it matters, you know, the these markets do
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.160]   have an impact on the voting public, because the media covers
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.000]   them, donors cover them, voter turnout is impacted by the
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.520]   polls. And then there's these, like, you know, various
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   psychological phenomenon, like the underdog impacts or
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:27.800]   bandwagon. So you could have, if people perceive at one point,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.920]   Trump is the underdog, maybe more people turn out. And then
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.840]   people who, you know, if Trump was winning versus Biden, so
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.920]   much, they might become complacent, and you get some sort
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.720]   of surprise there. So they do have actual impact on the
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.680]   voting public.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.400]   I suspect, though, that I suspect that a lot of that is
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:49.160]   really at the edges. The I read an article recently that just
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.200]   talked about the enormity of the investment that both the
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.960]   democrats and the republicans are making to get to these
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.520]   critical areas in these five critical states. And if you live
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:05.400]   in one of these zip codes that really matter. I think that
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.960]   there's just no room for anything but what each side is
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.800]   saying, I don't think you're looking at a betting market or a
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.400]   poll or any of this stuff. And I think the reason why these
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.240]   places have become so critical is that they are very balanced,
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.440]   they are people that have a good way of making sense of the
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.520]   world. And they change their minds a lot, right? Because
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.720]   otherwise, they're, they're people that underwrite and
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.240]   reunderwrite their decisions. And to me, that's actually a
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.920]   really wonderful thing to know that there are these, call it
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.760]   million people in these zip codes in five states that are
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.840]   actually quite thoughtful. And I'm actually okay that in the
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.800]   end that those folks will decide, I would be much more
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.240]   worried if it was hyper partisan and set up in a way
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:00.520]   where none of these lies, whoever tells them are
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.880]   uncovered. The way that it's set up today, all of the crazy
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.280]   ideas get run to the ground, all of the lies get uncovered.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.840]   And I think that that's a really healthy place. And I
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.360]   think it's a much better place. So I'm generally like, really
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.120]   glad that things look like, quote, unquote, a question mark,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.560]   because I think it creates much more pressure for the
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.760]   candidates to be precise. And I think that that's very
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.000]   important. So I'd love to talk about some of these crazy
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.960]   policy things as well.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.000]   Yeah, what are our policy sacks, I wanted to get your take on
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.240]   this. Trump's VP pick JD Vance is now the least popular VP pick
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.960]   in modern history. People said the same thing also about walls
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.280]   and that was a terrible pick. Here's your chart on JD. And
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   here's the historical chart. john Edwards, and I remember
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.720]   him. He was plus two in net rating, Tim waltz, plus five,
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.320]   Mike Pence, plus five, Kamala when she was VP, plus three, but
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:02.280]   JD Vance is absolutely. He's below Sarah Palin, which I
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.360]   guess takes ever, what's your take on the VP picks and the
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.920]   impact they're having here, because it's a major topic of
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.400]   discussion.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.880]   I think what history shows the VP pick doesn't matter that
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.720]   much people vote for what's happening at the top of the
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.560]   ticket. And I would argue the reason why JD has the poli does
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.120]   is because there's a couple of reasons. Number one is just
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.480]   media bias. And there was an interesting report showing that
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.360]   the media's coverage of the Harris campaign was 84%
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.640]   positive, whereas the coverage of the Trump campaign was 89%
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   negative, that actually seems to understate the bias that I
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.240]   see out there. But look, this is the number one reason why JD
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.640]   has a negative rating is because the media is defining him, I
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:44.440]   would say. Furthermore, JD is out there talking about ideas,
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.680]   and I give him credit for that. But because he is an idea man,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.960]   and he's also a writer, and he's said interesting things in
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.760]   the past, and also sometimes occasionally a sarcastic thing
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.480]   or two in the past, the media has been able to take those
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.320]   things out of context and harp on them relentlessly. On the
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.560]   other hand, you take someone like Tim waltz, and he's out
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.040]   there, he's not really talking about ideas. I mean, every time
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.920]   he goes up there and speaks, it's like a pep talk. I mean,
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:15.160]   if I wanted to hire a guy to give the halftime speech to my
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.840]   team, he'd be the guy, you know, if I wanted him out there,
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.480]   puffing up a team, we got to all give 110%. He's, he's the
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.560]   guy for that. But he's not really talking about ideas. He's
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.160]   not going on the Sunday shows, you look at JD. I mean, I've
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.640]   watched a couple of his campaign stops. I mean, the guy
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.560]   is really sharp. And when he goes on the Sunday show, they
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.040]   are pitching nothing but fastballs at him, and he's
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.600]   hitting it out of the park every time. And Harris and waltz
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.280]   are just not doing that. They're not even appearing on
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.120]   those shows. I don't think they could survive 20 minutes of
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   harsh questioning the way that the media pitches at JD every
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.720]   time he goes on a campaign stop and takes questions or he goes
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.160]   on a Sunday show. I love the JD pick, you know, venture
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.520]   capital's business guy, well written, well spoken, you're
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.160]   picking up on something that I think is really important that I
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.160]   think has been under reported. It really is a tale of two
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:13.160]   different tickets. The Republican ticket, whether you
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:21.240]   like them or not, are very financially astute actors. And
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.800]   if you look at the Democratic ticket, they are under invested
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.000]   to not invested at all in anything that would normally
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.800]   resemble the United States economy. And I find that a very
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:41.880]   odd distinction, meaning the way that I would think people would
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.920]   want to see their candidates is folks who have a very
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.400]   sophisticated understanding of the parts that they're going to
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.720]   govern. And in this case, if you're going to sit atop the
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.280]   economy, one would hope that you're invested in the economy
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.640]   in some way so that you know how it works. And it's a little
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.960]   surprising to me that nobody's really questions how how
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.520]   under invested the Democratic ticket is. And it's almost as if
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.440]   the the Republican ticket for their financial sophistication
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.800]   is looked down upon to unpack what you're saying here. There
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:17.160]   was a report. Tim Walz has no financial holdings. He has no
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.680]   stocks, no bonds, no mutual funds, no real estate, nothing,
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.480]   no cryptocurrency. This is what you're referring to. Yes, ma.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.800]   Yeah, the level of like, literally owning nothing. And I
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.440]   guess, Freiburg to your I'll let you take it from there.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:37.160]   So I think it's actually a step a little bit deeper than that.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:43.720]   Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz have only ever worked for
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:50.120]   government. Trump and Vance have worked in private industry.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:55.240]   It's not just their perspective being colored by the the lack
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.360]   of participation in the private economy, but the lack of
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.400]   employment in the private economy. They've never worked
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.600]   for a private business. They've never been employees of a
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.320]   private business. They've never built a private business. I'm
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.800]   not trying to be disparaging. But I do think I'm just trying
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.840]   to underline the point here, Chamath, which is the voters
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:17.080]   choice is, do you want candidates that are not
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.200]   typically government operatives? Or do you want
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.840]   candidates that have spent their whole career as government
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.320]   operatives? And that is effectively what the voters are
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.160]   going to be voting for. And they're going to make a
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.520]   decision, they may want to have someone that's going to lead the
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.160]   biggest government in history, because they've spent their
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.640]   whole careers in government. Or they're going to say, you know
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.120]   what, the biggest government in history needs to be
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.280]   significantly altered. And we want to bring someone in from
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.680]   the outside that's worked in private industry. And that is
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.320]   the voters choice. That's one way to view the voters choice
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.800]   here. That's an interesting framing. And another framing
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.760]   might be free bird. I love that. Hey, it's an interesting
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.480]   framing. Here's another framing. I don't you're a young person.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.400]   I can't own a home. They're too expensive. I don't have any
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.600]   equity. I'm getting ground down. I own a I owe a bunch of
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:07.240]   student loans. Tim walls feels more like the experience I'm
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.520]   having as a millennial where I can't afford a home where I
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.320]   don't have equity, where I'm constantly trying to pay off my
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.760]   bills. And the finance what we'll say is like, hey, this
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.560]   guy's not very financially astute. He doesn't because he's
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:23.960]   never it's because he's never maybe maybe it's because he's
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.760]   never had a private sector job. Well, he's been a teacher,
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.280]   right? So maybe people say, you know what, I feel I identify
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.680]   more with Tim Walz. And I think that's actually what might be
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.720]   happening here. public school teacher, right? Yeah. But yeah,
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.840]   which is a noble thing to be. And I think there's probably a
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.200]   large percentage of the country who feels like they're not part
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.800]   of the equity economy. They don't own a home. They don't
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.840]   own equities. And they have been shut out from this. And all
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.560]   these rich people like Trump and JD Vance and venture
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.760]   capitalists are running the table on them. And I think that
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.040]   might be why we're seeing even if the four of us disagree with
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.320]   it, we might be seeing someone like Tim was actually being a
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.640]   feature. It might be a feature to their to their
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:08.920]   And I think that there's a perception of experience in
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.960]   government that is deemed to make a government leader more
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.600]   appropriately suited to be a government leader, because of
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.040]   one politician. Yeah, well, not even a politician just career
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.880]   experience. So they're being employed by or working within
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.040]   the government within a government, local, state or
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.240]   federal. And remember, school has started her career at the
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.640]   DA's office in Alameda County before moving over to San
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:35.160]   Francisco DA's office. And then she was DA of San Francisco,
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.880]   and then Attorney General and so on and so forth.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.200]   sex, what do you think of this framing? You have two
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.880]   candidates who are career civil servants, who have dedicated
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.640]   their life to that, but who in one case has doesn't own his
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.360]   home doesn't own any equities. In the other case, Kamala does
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:54.200]   have a bunch of equity and some private wealth versus the
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.840]   capitalists. It looks like this actually is an interesting
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.400]   framing socialism versus capitalism. What's your thought
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.360]   on that? Well, I think just because someone has served in
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.400]   government doesn't mean that they truly even understand what
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.800]   the problems are, or that they're even the master of
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.040]   government. I mean, you saw this over the past week, we
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.120]   talked about the 818,000 jobs that didn't exist. They asked
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.360]   Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce about this. And she
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.400]   just said, That's a Trump lie. And they said, No, actually,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.760]   it's a Bureau of Labor Statistics report that like is
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.720]   under US Secretary of Commerce. So I'm not familiar with that.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.960]   So you have people running the government who don't even know
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.840]   what their own departments are doing. Now, I think it's just a
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.680]   function of the fact that government is so big and out of
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.640]   control, that no one even understands what it does. I
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.600]   think it's more important to have someone who at least has
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.480]   some experience in the private sector, who truly understands
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.840]   how jobs are created, how wealth is created, what causes
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.960]   inflation. Okay, we've talked about this before. Yeah, what
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.600]   causes inflation is the printing of too much money. It's
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.680]   government spending too much. Yeah, shocking. It is not
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.000]   corporate greed, because corporate greed is a constant.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.560]   It's not price gouging and how the free market incentivizes the
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.720]   creation of improved productivity, which over time
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.560]   translates into improved prosperity for the society
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.680]   within which that is taking place. That is so critical. And
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.520]   we saw that happen even in China, in the last 30 years,
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.720]   when the government allowed entrepreneurship to flourish in
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.200]   certain parts of the country. As a result, there were
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.240]   significant productivity gains. And they brought a billion
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.280]   people out of poverty. They created a middle class. I mean,
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.160]   they never had never had a middle class. I think it's
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.760]   important to not color this as because you worked in
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.800]   government, you can't be invested or you can't own a home
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.960]   where you can't actually have built the nest egg, right?
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.440]   Because that's also not true. And we have, there's some
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.560]   extreme examples of people who've been Pelosi essentially,
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.360]   yeah, career civil servants, essentially, and it built
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.840]   multi $100 million portfolio, we can, we can question in
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.440]   specifically, in the case of all house representatives,
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.320]   whether they're getting access to a kind of information
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.640]   that other people don't get access to, but taking that off
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   the table, I think that there are people in all kinds of
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:13.400]   jobs, who are able to save and invest, and then acquire
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.480]   things that they believe will give them security for
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.840]   themselves and their children in the future. And I don't
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.800]   think that it is because of a kind of job that you do. I
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.600]   think it's a kind of mindset that you have. And I think
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.200]   it's very important to make sure that whoever we pick,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.960]   we understand the mindset. I really believe that like, you
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:39.080]   know, there are a couple things that are really critical to
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.040]   thinking about the future, and wanting to make the future
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.160]   better. I think one obvious one is when you have kids, when
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.040]   you have kids, you're making sacrifices every day, you know,
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.760]   you're you're forgoing things today, because whether it's
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.960]   saving for college, saving for school, saving for a class,
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.760]   saving for a sports thing that you want your kids to go to
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.680]   musical, whatever it is, you're always finding ways of
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.800]   thinking about what is better for in the future for that
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.600]   other person, not me. And the second is, I think being an
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.440]   investor actually makes you care about the future in a
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.760]   really productive way. Because you're foregoing often cases,
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.280]   when we all invest, we're foregoing short term gains on
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.960]   the hope that we can help shape a much longer term outcome in
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.760]   the future, that makes all of that worthwhile. And so I like
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.760]   it when I can see people that have those things at play, and
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.640]   that they even in whatever small way they can are
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.120]   manifesting that. And I always have a question mark, like, how
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.440]   is it possible that at no point you have tried to be invested
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.480]   in your own and your children's future that way? It's just the
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.440]   it's just a question mark for me. Yeah, 58% of Americans own
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.400]   equities. And that includes like retirement accounts. So
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.520]   it's not like they're actively day trading. And so you know
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.040]   that that does actually sacks paint an interesting picture
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.080]   where maybe the Democratic Party now which they referred to
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.880]   themselves Bernie and Elizabeth Warren as a socialist, as
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.400]   socialist Democrats, maybe this is like part of their feature is
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.600]   to appeal to that large swath of people who don't own their
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.920]   homes, who don't have kids. And you know, to JD's point about
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.320]   cat ladies, and to, you know, who don't own homes, don't have
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.080]   kids and don't have equities. What are your thoughts on that
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.840]   sex? Is that maybe how these parties are starting to shape up
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.720]   in the modern era? Yeah, actually, I think I think that's
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.520]   right. I mean, I think that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.400]   Sanders are now the thought leaders and really the beating
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.200]   heart of the Democrat Party. I think what's happened is the
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.080]   Republican Party has moved to right wing populism. And the
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.360]   Democrats in response to that have concluded that they need to
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.560]   basically move to left wing populism in order to compete
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.040]   with that. So both parties are becoming fairly populist. Now,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.520]   what is what is left wing populism mean? It basically
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.640]   means soak the rich, right? It's a strong element of class
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.040]   warfare to it. We're going to make the rich pay for
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.760]   everything and the rich are the problem. It's this fundamental
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.960]   unfairness of the economy that's causing all these problems.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.000]   And I think you've heard that over and over again at the DNC.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.720]   I mean, just the clips that I've seen, this has been a
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.880]   recurring theme is the hatred towards, you know, billionaires
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.560]   and, and tax the rich is a recurring theme. And that's
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.160]   actually a great jump off point here. Because the big news in
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.080]   our circles this weekend on social media was and some of the
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.240]   group chats is that Harris has reportedly backed some of
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.480]   Biden's really out there tax plans, which include a proposed
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.600]   25% wealth tax on people with over $100 million in assets.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.320]   Important to note that this would be very hard to pass,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.640]   because getting these tax increases, you'd have to get
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.960]   through Congress, etc. But let's just talk about what the
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.920]   proposal is, because it's out there. In Biden's 2025 tax plan,
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:57.320]   which the campaign has said to semi for, which is a niche
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   publication, like a newsletter company, that and I'll just give
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.200]   the quote in a little notice portion of its Friday analysis
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.800]   of Harris's new economic plans, the Committee for a responsible
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:12.360]   federal budget wrote that her campaign said it endorsed the
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.160]   suite of revenue options included in President Joe's
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:19.800]   recent budget. And that's the FRB report said, quote, the
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.400]   campaign has communicated to us that Vice President Harris
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.000]   continues to support all of the revenue raising provisions in
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.320]   the President's 2025 budget. So there is continuity confirmed
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.440]   between Harris and Biden's plans. I'll just explain as
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:40.040]   simply as I can what this extreme plan says, and then I'll
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.360]   get Chamath your take on it. Biden's proposed 2025 tax plan
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:48.200]   includes the following 25% unrealized cap gain tax on those
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:52.440]   with over 100 million assets 28% corporate tax rate right now
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.920]   it's 21. Trump had proposed a 15% rate and quadrupling the
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.880]   stock buyback tax to 4%. That's when a company buys their own
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.680]   shares as opposed to putting it to work in the market. The
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.800]   stock buyback tax was created as Biden's inflation Reduction
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.240]   Act of 2022. It's just 1% if you want to buy back your shares
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.760]   like Apple and some other companies do. But let's unpack
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:19.240]   the 25% unrealized cap gains because that seems to be, you
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.080]   know, the most, let's say, I don't want to say triggering,
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.480]   but the one that's triggered the most number of people,
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.280]   there's 5000 people who fit into that category. What do you
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.400]   think Chamath of this proposal? Fair, unfair, crazy,
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.360]   social, anti American? It's less about fair or unfair, but
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:44.280]   I think that we are in the part of the cycle, where enough
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.600]   people don't feel the positive aspects of capitalism that they
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:53.560]   want to push back against it. I just put a little image in here,
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.480]   Nick, if you want to just throw it up in the chat. But when you
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.640]   look from 1913, on to today, the reality is we've had many
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.360]   different forms of political philosophy that have governed
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.600]   the country. And what you can see is that tax rates have
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:16.440]   varied wildly at the federal level. And I think it's because
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.840]   that at certain times, there was the political will to go to
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.400]   extremes. And this may be a moment where we are going to
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:31.800]   explore the extremes that we had in the 40s and the 50s. And I
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.120]   think the reality is that if that does happen, you're going
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.160]   to see people behave in ways that weren't possible in the
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.040]   40s and 50s. In the 40s and 50s, everybody was more
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.720]   geopolitically constrained. I don't think that that's the case
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.520]   anymore. And the way that people start companies where they
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.520]   start companies, the flexibility of citizenship have changed
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.600]   really dramatically. So if it's the will of the people that they
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.040]   want to explore these mechanisms, I think other people
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.680]   will react in kind and, you know, the dye will be cast. So
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.600]   you know, I don't have much you're referring to removing
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.760]   I think you're implying people might be able to move to other
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.560]   places and create companies there. Is that what I'm reading?
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.360]   Let's put it this way. We have, we have a small microcosm of
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.960]   this going on within the 50 states, which is, if you said
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:27.080]   California was the United States, and Texas and Florida
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.960]   were, I'll make up two different countries, Malta, and Dubai,
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   well, what happens when taxation goes beyond the pale? And what
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.760]   happens when budget deficits and spending go beyond the pale?
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.440]   And when the government plays too large of a hand in the
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.680]   economy, people leave with their feet, companies leave. So we
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.720]   don't need to guess what's going to happen. Because if it can
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.800]   happen between California and Texas, it probably stands to
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.760]   reason it can happen between the United States and the UAE as
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.840]   an example. Yeah. You already have a bunch of hedge fund
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.640]   manors moving over there, right? Shama, I have people are
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.400]   starting to buy apartments. And there's, there's, there's golden
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.240]   visas in some great countries, Portugal has a golden visa. The
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:20.840]   UAE has a golden visa, Italy has a golden visa. The UK had this
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:25.640]   great program, what was called non doms for a long time. So the
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.960]   the point is that all of these took advantage of countries that
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.600]   went to extremes, and they lost citizens as a result. And I
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.000]   suspect that if what the US voting population wants to do is
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.080]   explore that extreme, these policies will get enacted, and
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.880]   then people will act in kind. The only thing that I would just
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:50.120]   again, reinforces, unlike when taxes went to 90% in the 40s and
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.840]   50s, people are much, much more mobile than they were then. And
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.200]   that was during World War Two in the post war era. Freeberg,
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.120]   your thoughts on this proposal specifically, which impacts a
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.760]   very small number of people, although maybe a high percentage
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.040]   here. Yeah. So so just just to give a little more detail to it,
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.680]   Jake out, please. And you can actually see it. I think if you
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:16.280]   want to pull up the page, 8283 in the document, so the wealth
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.240]   tax is 25% of your unrealized capital gains, if your net worth
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.760]   is above 100 million. And the first time this happens, you can
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.480]   split up the payments over nine years, you have nine years to
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.920]   kind of pay down the assets or sell the assets or borrow the
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.600]   money you need to make those tax payments. After that, you can
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.160]   actually make those payments over five years, those payments
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.040]   are ultimately treated as pre payments on taxes that will be
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.400]   due when you realize the capital gains. Every year you have to
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:48.120]   report to the IRS, separated by asset class, the cost basis and
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.560]   the estimated value of every asset you have, you then have to
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.440]   determine your tax that you owe because of the difference from
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.520]   last year, you start out with tradable assets of stocks, those
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.440]   are just valued at the end of year. illiquid assets like
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.440]   private companies, or real estate, you don't have to get a
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.560]   valuation, if there's a financing event, or some other
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.120]   sort of major revaluation, you have to use that value. And if
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.800]   there isn't, the number goes up every year by some nominal rate
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.960]   that will be set by the Treasury. So the Treasury is
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.000]   basically going to tell you what they think the value of your
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.600]   company has gone up on an annual basis. And that's the
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.640]   determination of valuation, you can file an appeal. So for all
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.520]   the entrepreneurs and startup people listening, there's a
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.560]   process that they're proposing, that is basically the government
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.200]   saying if you didn't get a new financing round done, the price
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.920]   goes up. And if you disagree with the price going up, you go
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.960]   back and you appeal it.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.000]   Let's pause there for a second, Freiburg, because this is super
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.880]   important, I think, to the audience here. Somebody has a
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.480]   startup company, it becomes worth $10 billion, it has 100
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.240]   million in revenue, it's doing well, it's losing money for nine
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.800]   valuation comes in founder owns 25%. co founders on 25%. Each,
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.720]   they own two or $3 billion in stock. Now you've got an illiquid
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.040]   founder, who owns $3 billion in stock, companies not going
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.920]   public, there's no secondary market, what would happen to
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.120]   that founder would.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.080]   So they've addressed this. And that's the final provision. And
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.720]   what they said is that if a taxpayer is treated as what
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.640]   they're calling illiquid, meaning that their tradable
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.080]   assets, the stocks that they own, or the cash that they have
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:34.280]   is less than 20% of their total wealth, then they may elect to
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.680]   include only the unrealized gain in their tradable assets to
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.600]   determine their tax liability. However, if you do this, you
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.080]   will actually have a deferral charge, which means you'll
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.440]   ultimately pay a higher tax on the capital gains on your
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.320]   illiquid asset when you do have a have a realized capital gain
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.040]   on it. So they're trying to cover the fact that people might
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.760]   have all their assets tied up in real estate, or all their
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.960]   assets tied up in private company stock. And again, I feel
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   like we're we're kind of shouting into an abyss here,
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.040]   because this is only going to affect such a small number of
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.560]   people. But they've really tried to write this in a way that
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   ultimately covers the kind of pushback that you're
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.680]   highlighting. I'll say one other piece of pushback that's been
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.280]   received and tested in the Supreme Court. A lot of people
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:21.720]   have said that the 16th amendment prohibits this
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.000]   taxation, a ruling from the Supreme Court was published
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.480]   June of this year. And in that particular case, there was a
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.880]   repatriation tax for folks that left the country, it's the more
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.240]   versus United States tax case. And when people left the
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.760]   country, the government under the Tax and Jobs Act, which was
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.080]   passed under the Trump administration, the government
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.480]   had a right to go after people's assets and tax them on
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.200]   their unrealized gains, even after they give up their US
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.920]   citizenry. This was challenged to the Supreme Court. And there
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.680]   was a number of amicus briefs filed on this case that said the
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.920]   government does not have the authority and Congress doesn't
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.640]   have the authority to actually tax on unrealized capital gains.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.200]   And at the end of the day, the Supreme Court agreed to hear
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.640]   the case. And they did not overturn on the position that
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.720]   the government actually did not overstep their authority to be
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.000]   able to tax unrealized capital gains. So there is some Supreme
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.120]   Court case precedents here that indicates that this will not get
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.400]   thrown out on an unconstitutional ground basis. So
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.120]   there is a lot of conversation that this might actually become
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.760]   a real case. I'll pause there. And I actually have a theory I
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.480]   want to talk about in a minute. But it's a little bit of an
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.640]   extension from this point. But that is this summer, a seizure
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:38.520]   of assets in your mind? Is it constitutional in your mind? Two
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.160]   questions there?
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.560]   It's certainly a confiscation. I mean, basically, this, this tax
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.080]   is directed at centimillionaires and billionaires to basically
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.040]   take 25% of what they have. I mean, that's basically what this
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.440]   is about. There's a good reason why realization is one of the
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.680]   core concepts of our tax code. What real realization gives you
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.320]   two really important things. Number one, you have a sale
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.920]   price, right, your realization means that you sell the asset.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.200]   So we know exactly how much you made. Number two, you have the
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.160]   liquidity to pay the tax bill because you've just sold the
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.440]   asset. The problem with an unrealized gains tax is both
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.480]   those issues. Number one, we don't know what the assets
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.480]   really worth. You know, it's easier to, to put a value on a
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.840]   publicly traded asset, but a private asset, it's very hard to
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.880]   know exactly how much it's worth the valuations bouncing around
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.680]   all the time. What this bill would do is create, I guess, a
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.160]   whole new process and bureaucracy to try and put a
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.360]   value on that. But it's going to be really complicated to
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.560]   comply with all of us are going to need to hire a whole new
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.000]   legion of lawyers and accountants. So I mean, you're
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.520]   talking about a whole new, essentially tax bureaucracy
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.760]   that's going to spring up around this concept on the
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.960]   liquidity part, you're being taxed a huge amount without
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.560]   having the cash to pay the tax bill. And you know, yes,
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.880]   they've tried to mitigate that by creating this installment
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.080]   plan, but you're still going to need to go out and sell large
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.720]   chunks of your company. Every time you get an up round in
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.080]   order to pay the tax bill. And that means that you're losing
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.960]   ownership of your your company, all these assets are going to
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.800]   be dumped on the market. And you're basically starving the
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.600]   market of capital, actually, right? Because all these people
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.160]   who, who are owners of their company are gonna have to go
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.160]   out and sell a big chunk of them.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.520]   This is going to put so much cold water on the entrepreneurial
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.560]   market, it's going to make people just have less liquidity
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.840]   to invest in things. I think this is going to be disastrous
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.320]   because a lot of people to retire early, because they just
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.840]   don't want to deal with all this.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.720]   Well, Friedberg, what's your theory? Okay, I've got a theory.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.000]   Oh, theory. Here we go. Good.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.720]   I was trying to figure out why we seem to be like embracing
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.920]   socialist principles. Why I keep seeing more of this stuff
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.840]   become mainstream and almost become normalized. And I was
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:18:00.760]   looking at the total GDP of the United States is $25 trillion.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.000]   The federal budget for next year is proposed to be 7.2
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.240]   trillion. And state and local budgets combined is about 4
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.760]   trillion. So if you look at government spending, it's about
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.760]   half of GDP now, state, local and federal, which roughly
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.360]   equates to about half of people in the United States are
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.640]   employed directly by government, or indirectly, because
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.880]   the government is the primary revenue source of their
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.760]   business. And I think that that's why this, this set of
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.320]   policies and I'm not talking about the tax on the cent of
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:41.480]   millionaires, as much as a simple disregard for the fact
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.080]   that the United States, over time, the prosperity that we've
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.600]   realized has been driven by a free market economy by
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.560]   enterprising individuals going out and saying there are people
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.040]   that are asking for things, I'm going to figure out a way to
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.600]   build those things and make it for them and sell it to them,
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.640]   people will pay for it, they will work hard to do it. And the
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.000]   incentive structure in a free market has enabled productivity
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.880]   improvements and enabled ultimately prosperity. But
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.840]   we've reached a tipping point. And the tipping point is when
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.040]   half or more of the population begins to be employed by the
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.520]   government, at which point that concept is lost. Because now it
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.560]   is the government that is the employer, not one's own
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.320]   individual liberties and ability to go out and be
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.160]   enterprising. And so I think that the budget of government
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.160]   tipping to 50% of GDP is the reason why these policies
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.880]   become mainstream. That's my theory. And so it's a
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.240]   relationship of government spending as a percent of total
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.760]   GDP, which translates into employment. You guys are
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.080]   reasonable, scary, but reasonable.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.720]   Well, you know, who said something similar back when Mitt
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.000]   Romney ran for president, he was caught on tape saying
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.920]   something to the effect that 47% of Americans were net
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.440]   government recipients. And if that number ever got to 51%,
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.600]   then basically, the free market system would be finished
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.800]   because it'd be more we are more than makers, tipping more
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.600]   takers than makers. And he was forced to apologize for that.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.000]   But there is a fundamental logic to it.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.560]   I wouldn't use the term taker sacks, because there are
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.480]   hardworking people that work for the government. And so
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.280]   it's not necessarily about just taking a free check, or
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.880]   there's certainly an aspect of that to some degree. But it
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:26.360]   is about the government becoming the primary supporter
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.480]   of individuals in this country through employment, or
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.560]   through subsidies, or through checks, or through through
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.120]   what have you.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.400]   Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's totally fair. I'm
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.560]   not disparaging the efforts of legitimate government workers,
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.360]   because you do need a government, or private company
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.600]   workers that just happened to have the government as their
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:48.520]   only customer. Right. But the point the point is that when
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:51.400]   you become a government employee, you have a vested
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.480]   interest in government, you should have a vested interest
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.560]   in the private sector as well, because that's what generates
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.840]   the tax revenue to fund the government. But as a practical
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.240]   matter, government workers vote massively in a block for the
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.040]   Democrat Party. And in many ways, the Democrat Party is the
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.840]   party of government workers. You look in California, for
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.080]   example, the various government workers unions are the most
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.840]   powerful players in California politics.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.720]   What's the political affiliation of like, has there ever been
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.000]   surveys done of employees at the federal level and what their
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.520]   political affiliations are?
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.600]   Oh, yeah, vastly, vastly more Democrat. I mean, look, the
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.280]   Democrats are the party of government. Absolutely.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.960]   I'm surprised by that, because I would think that within the
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.480]   ranks of the military,
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.520]   you look at the enlisted military, there's a lot of
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.800]   Republicans in there, a lot of military families, especially
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.680]   Republican, but you look at just government workers,
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.840]   vastly more Democrat. I think there's other things happening
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.960]   as well. I mean, look, American capitalism requires a robust
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.880]   middle class. And in many ways, I think globalization has
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.160]   hollowed out the middle class. There used to be a large middle
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.920]   class in this country of blue collar workers who worked with
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.240]   their hands. They were not knowledge workers. And they
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:08.120]   worked in factories and they did kind of blue collar work, and
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.880]   they could still make a middle class living. And I think that
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.640]   over the last 20 to 30 years, as a result of globalization,
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.760]   millions and millions of those jobs went away and millions of
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.680]   factories shut down. So the middle class of America, that's
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.960]   not, you know, again, that's not knowledge workers, were really
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.760]   pressured by basically throwing open American markets to
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.200]   foreign goods. Now, you could argue that that lowered prices
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.320]   and that created consumer surplus and the benefits of
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.200]   trade. Do you support the Trump tariffs as a solution? They're
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.120]   sacks because those are fundamentally going to be
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.000]   inflationary, which is going to make the cost go up for everyone.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.240]   Well, I don't know, but I'm just I'm just pointing out that
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:50.040]   there was a real price in terms of having this free trade that
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.800]   led to huge trade deficits, which is this vast American
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.520]   middle class of people who worked with their hands got put
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.640]   out of work. And I think that removes a huge incentive for
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:06.040]   people to be invested in to have a vested interest in the free
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.680]   market system.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.720]   tax. Let me ask you one more question. Do you think that the
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.960]   Biden administration's bills, the inflation Reduction Act and
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:18.760]   the CHIPS Act, both of which were meant to revitalize that
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.280]   middle class kind of industrial economy through government
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:25.720]   funding of developing new facilities in the US to onshore
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.480]   manufacturing? Is that not a good, reasonable solution to
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.360]   that problem?
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.760]   Well, those are two very different bills. I mean, the
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.560]   Inflation Reduction Act, just the name itself should tell you
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.280]   that it doesn't.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.480]   The Inflation Maximization Act.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:43.560]   Yeah, look who benefited from that our friends who are energy
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.960]   investors, who you know who I'm talking about?
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:24:02.680]   He said that this bill was the biggest bonanza that they've
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:08.760]   ever seen. He said these guys were running around like, you
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.000]   know, it was like the Beverly Hillbillies where they struck a
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.480]   gusher. And they're running around with fans trying to
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.200]   collect the oil. That's what he basically said this was. But it
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:20.760]   was a bunch of energy investors at Stanford, and the manna was
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.240]   coming down from heaven. And they're just going to collect
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.440]   as much of it. That was a huge boondoggle and payoff for these
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.000]   green energy investors. That's who it went to. It did not
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.600]   benefit the middle class at all.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.480]   What about the CHIPS Act?
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.960]   The CHIPS Act is more complicated because it does create
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.400]   incentives for manufacturing in America. And moreover, there is
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.600]   a national security element to it, because we need these
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.600]   advanced chips, we can't be totally dependent on chipmakers
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.680]   who are in foreign places within 100 miles of the Chinese
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.040]   mainland, right? So that one's a little more complicated.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.520]   Meanwhile, Intel is imploding, you know, they can't
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.320]   manufacture.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.040]   So well, just to finish the thought, I mean, the the issue
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.840]   with the CHIPS Act is that there's a lot of good reasons to
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.200]   believe that even if we incentivize this, we're still
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.880]   hopelessly behind. And the chip fabs that we're building are
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.440]   just, they're still years behind what they have in Taiwan.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.560]   For example, so it's not clear it's going to work is my point.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.440]   But but I think the motivations make a lot more sense.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.760]   All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode of
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.560]   the all in podcast socialism is garbage, and it turns into
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.280]   communism.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.320]   Now I'm exacerbated. I mean, if Kamala doesn't get out there
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.440]   and start doing some interviews and explaining herself, I'm out.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.480]   I mean, I'm
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.920]   making news right now. I'm just frustrated. I'm literally going
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.320]   to smash this laptop and with my right when Jay Cal was about to
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.480]   become a centimeter. She shut the door.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.640]   I mean, it may have already happened. Anyway.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:03.400]   I mean, that's so funny. Yeah, Uber rally to what's the what's
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.240]   the price now? 80 bucks.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.240]   You're going to get a much different answer to generate we
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.000]   need someone to generate a meme. Take out $40 a share.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.280]   $80 a share.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:22.040]   No, I mean, I just we need to get a lot on this program here.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.360]   Face the music. Let's go. You want to run for president? Come
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.840]   on all in and let's talk about it. If she's not going to answer
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.960]   basic questions is disqualifying for me who's trying to get her
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.040]   is anyone trying to sit on it? I mean, but I mean, we'd love to
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.000]   have her on. We'd love to have JD on we'd love to have waltz on
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.560]   let's go let's have some real conversations about this stuff.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.720]   By the way, can I just make one final point that I realize
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.520]   gains tax is best case scenario what the CBO estimated is that
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.200]   would raise about 400 billion a year for all these tax hikes.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.520]   That's only 20% of the deficit we're running right now. We
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.800]   don't get anywhere close to closing the deficit with all
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.840]   these tax hikes. What that means is you have to cut spending.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.320]   Moreover, she's got a bunch of new programs to increase that
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.320]   deficit. And we know that that 400 billion number is an
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:10.040]   optimistic scenario because like Jamal was saying, the rich
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.840]   people are going to flee, they're going to try and move
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.440]   their wealth into structures or places where it's hard to tell.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.080]   I think it's actually more than that. I think what will happen
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.240]   is funds, governments, etc. For the right entrepreneurs with the
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.320]   right assets will help you pay the exit tax so that you can
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.640]   just leave the United States. And that's going to be an
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.520]   investment class that's going to emerge in my opinion, which
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.640]   is these organizations that will pool capital, sovereign
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:38.440]   wealth funds specifically. And when an entrepreneur shows up
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:43.720]   and they have, you know, 50, 100, a billion dollar tax bill
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.760]   to expatriate from the United States, they will pay it for
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.560]   you. And the reason is they'll bring the jobs and they'll bring
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.520]   the know how. And they'll bring the future capital investment
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.840]   into that country. It's a very easy investment to underwrite
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.600]   actually. So I would, I would just pay a lot of close
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.520]   attention to the fact that capital flows are very fungible
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.400]   in 2024. And they'll only become more fungible over time.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.320]   Buenos Aires. Anyway, it's beautiful, beautiful.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.560]   This happened. By the way, this happened in France. I mean,
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:16.200]   they literally did this. They tried it a lot of French
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.960]   citizens, all of a sudden became citizens.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.600]   I think it's important, though, you have to now go to the
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.240]   logic. If this is what people want, I think it's important for
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.280]   people to see the impact of it. And then for them to have to
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.440]   change their mind or stay with what they're doing, because it's
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:33.560]   working. Yeah, it's not going to work right, Jake out in
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:36.280]   France and Norway. This was tried there. Every time wealth
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.520]   taxes get tried. What happens is the wealth fleas and you never
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520]   raise as much as you think you're going to. And then what
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.240]   happens is in order to raise that money, they have to apply
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.200]   it to more people. Elizabeth Warren already wants to apply it
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.160]   to Americans with a net worth of 50 million, not 100 million.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.480]   So this whole idea that, well, this won't affect me because
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.360]   I'm not one of those rich people. The IRS was created and
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.680]   they when they created the income tax, it was originally
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.160]   only supposed to apply to less than the top 1%.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.520]   Okay, I got to go. Love you guys. So everybody, thanks for
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.720]   coming to the all in podcast episode 193. We'll see you next
