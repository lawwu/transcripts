[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.640]   - We have electronic mail from listener Charles Dazel
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.560]   in South Africa.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.440]   Pastor John, I love listening to the podcast each day.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.520]   If I'm correct, the Bible mentions the phrase,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.960]   the book of life about 14 times.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.760]   And quite a few of those passages
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.280]   mention getting blotted out of the book of life.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.640]   How does this not mean losing your salvation?
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.400]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Charles?
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.240]   - When it comes to the doctrine of eternal security
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.580]   or perseverance of the saints,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.120]   we need to speak with precision.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   And I think it's not quite precise to say, as Charles does,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.240]   in quite a few of the scriptures,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.240]   it mentions you can be blotted out of the book of life.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.480]   I don't think it ever says you can be blotted out,
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.120]   at least not in the sense that sometimes God does it.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.960]   It says we will be blotted out
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   if we fail to meet certain conditions.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.860]   Now, whether that ever happens
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.860]   or in God's sovereignty can happen is another question.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.620]   I don't think so, and let me try to show why.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.000]   The book of Revelation is the book
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.840]   that refers to this most often,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.360]   and it's the book that has the text
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.200]   that sounds most problematical, I think.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280]   So Revelation 3:5 says,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   "He who overcomes shall thus be clothed in white garments,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.660]   and I will not erase his name from the book of life,
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.460]   and I will confess his name before my Father and his angels."
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.140]   Now, some say, "Well, that's a foolproof text
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.220]   against the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.980]   or eternal security."
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.460]   They assume that when Revelation 3:5 says
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.980]   that God will not erase a person's name
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.180]   from the book of life,
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.660]   it implies that he does erase some people
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.920]   from the book of life,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.120]   and that these people would once be born again,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.360]   justified, saved, and nevertheless, in the end,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.280]   condemned, lost, perish.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.440]   In other words, they lose their salvation
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.900]   on that reading of that verse.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.160]   But is that a true assumption?
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.680]   The promise, "I will not erase his name
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.600]   from the book of life,"
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.720]   does not necessarily imply
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.880]   that some do have their names erased.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.120]   It simply says to the one who is in the book
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.800]   and who conquers in faith,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.380]   "I will never wipe your name out."
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.280]   In other words, being erased is a fearful prospect,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.820]   which I will not allow to happen to those who persevere.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.820]   In fact, there are two other passages in Revelation
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.280]   that teach that to have your name in the book of life
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.300]   means that you will most definitely persevere and conquer
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.700]   and thus meet the condition not to be blotted out.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.460]   For example, Revelation 13:8 says this,
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.460]   "And all who dwell on the earth will worship the beast.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.040]   Everyone whose name has not been written
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.380]   from the foundation of the world
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.840]   in the book of the life of the Lamb who was slain."
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   Now, that verse teaches that those whose names are written
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.380]   in the book of life
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.160]   definitely will not worship the beast.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's what it says.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.820]   In other words, having your name in the book of life
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.460]   from the foundation of the world
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.460]   means God will keep you from falling.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.680]   He will cause you to persevere in allegiance to God.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   Being in the book means you will not apostatize.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.960]   You'll not forsake the faith.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.420]   Same point in Revelation 17, 8.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.180]   The beast, this is what it says,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   the beast that you saw was and is not
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.000]   and is about to come up out of the abyss
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.900]   and go to destruction.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.480]   And those who dwell on the earth
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   whose names have not been written in the book of life
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.460]   from the foundation of the world
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.820]   will marvel when they see the beast
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.880]   that was and is and will come.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.440]   Now, that means having your name in the book of life
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.720]   means you will be kept from marveling at the beast.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.960]   Those whose names are not written in the book
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   will marvel at the beast
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.640]   and those whose names are in the book will not marvel.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.600]   It's infallible as far as the way this author is arguing.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.620]   To have your name in the book means you won't marvel,
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.640]   you won't worship.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   So the point is that having one's name
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.300]   written in the book is effective.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.800]   It keeps you from making shipwreck of your faith.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.360]   John does not say, if you worship the beast,
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.720]   your name is erased.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.120]   He says, if your name is in the book,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.720]   you will not worship the beast.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.520]   Now, back to 3.5, Revelation 3.5.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   He who overcomes, I will not erase his name
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.480]   from the book of life.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.740]   Does that mean God erases some people?
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.740]   No, the conquering that keeps you from being erased
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.480]   is guaranteed by being in the book.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.360]   That's the point of 13.8 and 17.8.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.520]   Being in the book keeps you from doing
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.000]   what would get you erased from the book if you did it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.280]   - Amen, yes.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.020]   - And say that again.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.400]   Being in the book, having your name in the book
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.280]   keeps you from doing, like worshiping the beast,
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.640]   keeps you from doing what would get you erased
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.200]   from the book if you did it.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.000]   And that's not a contradiction
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.880]   any more than the way Paul is a contradiction
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.760]   when he says, work out your salvation,
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.560]   for God is at work in you to will
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.240]   and to do his good pleasure.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.940]   Philippians 2.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.160]   It's not nonsense to state the condition,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.280]   if you conquer, God will not erase your name.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.680]   And then to state the assurance,
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.440]   if your name is in the book, you will conquer.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.400]   That's not a contradiction.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   God's written down ones really must conquer,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   really will conquer.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.640]   They must and they will.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.440]   One side highlights responsibility, you must,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.780]   and one side highlights God's sovereignty, you will.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.100]   So the message for us is, I think,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   never, never, never be cavalier or trifling
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.580]   about your perseverance.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.380]   God uses real warnings to keep us vigilant
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.140]   and to keep us persevering.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.140]   We are safe, but we are not careless.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.380]   That's the point.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   Press on to make salvation your own, as Paul says,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.400]   because Christ has made you his own.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.840]   Safe, but not careless.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.420]   Well said, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.760]   And we'd love to hear from our international audience,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.740]   like Charles in South Africa.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.460]   And to send us a concise question of your own,

[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.860]   Well, we're back tomorrow and we're gonna look
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.000]   at how the gospel of Jesus Christ sensitizes us
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.260]   to life in this world,
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.780]   so that we can discern the manifold experiences
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.620]   of this life.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.860]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.260]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.460]   with John Piper, and we'll see you tomorrow.
