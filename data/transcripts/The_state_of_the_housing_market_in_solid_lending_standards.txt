[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samara and greetings from Lake Tahoe, California.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.360]   We're on our last family vacation before preschool starts and we're happy and yet we're a little
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.520]   bit sad that our little boy is going to be away from us.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.060]   I hope the transition goes smooth because I heard the transition of the first week is
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.280]   not so good.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.520]   But anyway, in this podcast I want to focus on the housing market as well as talk about
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.520]   the average credit score to qualify for a mortgage.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.280]   I am still in the middle of my mortgage refinance and it's been three months, three very long
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.280]   months.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.400]   The good thing, you know, it was tough in the beginning and then there was like nothingness
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.840]   for several weeks in the middle.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.720]   And at the end it's kind of like, well, the documents you sent in the first couple months
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.040]   have expired so please resend them again.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.400]   And I was thinking to myself, man, this is just nuts.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.760]   And I'll tell you more about my journey once it's over, but boy, it is not easy to refinance
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.440]   a mortgage nowadays and it's probably not easy to get a new mortgage nowadays for purchase.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.860]   As mortgage rates have tumbled to multi-year lows, there's been a massive, massive surge
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.120]   in refinances and new mortgage applications.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.840]   If you look at the data, I think for July it's up about 50% year over year in terms
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.760]   of mortgage applications and refinancing.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.240]   So August is probably going to be probably higher given rates tumbled a little bit more.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.880]   So the drop in mortgage rates is one of the key reasons why I don't think there will be
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.280]   a housing downturn as vicious as the one we saw between 2008 and 2010.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.240]   Further, it takes about six months for the effects of a large mortgage rate change to
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.580]   show up in the housing data.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.400]   So in other words, I think there's pent up demand building right now as buyers take a
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.160]   wait and see approach to the economy.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.640]   Everybody's heard about the inverted yield curve and how there's trade wars and how,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   hey, there might be a recession in 2020 or 2021, so why buy ahead of that recession?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   Why not just wait?
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.840]   But the reality is life doesn't wait for the perfect time.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   Life just happens.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.800]   If you have a child, you have two children, whatever it is, you're going to probably need
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.720]   more space and you're going to buy.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.520]   And if you want to get a better indication of what the future of housing might look like,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.920]   simply check out the performance of a home building ETF like XHB.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:36.000]   At the time of this podcast, August 29th, 2019, XHB is up about 26%, which is about
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.440]   10, 11% better than the S&P 500 year to date.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.240]   So that should be an interesting sign and I think a good sign.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.000]   So if you've been waiting to buy property, I think you have this window in the second
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.760]   half of 2019 to get a good deal because I am seeing more inventory on the market and
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.520]   I am seeing just more deals go through.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.860]   Now if we're going to go into a multi-year down cycle, well, buying now, you're probably
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.600]   not going to make any money for two to four to five years.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.240]   So therefore, if you're going to go buy property, you want to aggressively bargain right now
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.300]   and also make sure you hold on for at least five years, if not 10 years plus.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.640]   In addition to lower interest rates, higher lending standards post-financial crisis is
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.800]   another reason why the next recession shouldn't be as bad as the last.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.000]   Gone are the days of negative amortizing liar loans to people with terrible credit.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.280]   It has become far more difficult to get a mortgage today and I'm living through it right
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.540]   now.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.320]   So according to the latest quarterly report on household debt and credit by the New York
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.360]   Fed, nine out of 10 US mortgages go to borrowers with a score of 650 or better.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.560]   Three quarters go to borrowers with scores of better than 700.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.920]   Meanwhile, the average credit score for the 50th percentile is about 760.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   760!
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.300]   I remember refinancing, actually no, I remember getting a new loan out in 2014 and the lender
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.240]   at the time was saying, "Hey, if you have over a 720 credit score, you should be able
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.720]   to get the best rate possible at the time."
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   And now, based on my current experience, before even starting my mortgage refinance process,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.280]   the lender asked me straight up, "Hey, Sam, do you have a credit score of higher than
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   800?
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.100]   Because that's the only way you're going to get the highest rate."
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.140]   So things have gotten much more difficult now.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.820]   If you do qualify for a mortgage with less than a 760 credit score, your lender will
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:50.720]   likely be charging you about 0.125% to 0.75% more than if you had had a 76+ credit score.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.880]   So stop thinking that a credit score above 670 is good, according to FICO.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.480]   It's really not that good.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.680]   Just like how it's not good the average American has only a median net worth of about $87,000.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.240]   I mean, look, if you retire with $87,000, well, that's not going to happen.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.480]   You're not going to retire with only $87,000 because you just can't live off that.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.200]   Even with Social Security, it's going to be a really sparse existence.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.400]   And it's just like the average American has never traveled abroad, doesn't speak a second
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.160]   language, is not in good shape, and will likely die younger than they're supposed to due to
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.040]   cardiovascular diseases and other things.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.020]   So being average or the median in America is not a great position to be in.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.660]   You want to be far, far above average.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.000]   We're experiencing this winner-take-all reality right now, where the people who are far above
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.280]   average are gaining most of the economic benefits.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.940]   And to illustrate this point, there's a great graph in the Post about mortgage originations
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.420]   by credit score.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:04.040]   And you can clearly see folks with 760-plus credit scores have over half of all mortgage
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.340]   originations.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.840]   And then if you look at the 720 to 759 category, that's about another 15% to 20%.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:21.680]   So in other words, the people with over a 720 credit score account for about 70% to
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.220]   75% of all mortgage originations.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.320]   You need a minimum of 620 to qualify for a government-backed loan by Fannie Mae and Freddie
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   Mac.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.240]   However, the government, in all its wisdom, allows people to qualify for a Federal Housing
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.200]   Administration mortgage with a credit score as low as 500 if you can make a down payment
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.360]   of at least 10%.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.680]   That is way too low in my opinion.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.520]   When a downturn comes, borrowers who receive government-backed loans will likely suffer
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   the highest default rates, partly because there's a history of poor credit, but also
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.920]   because the interest rate that they're getting is going to be much higher than everybody
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   else.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.240]   And what's going to happen is, just like in the past financial crisis, there's going
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.040]   to be a snowball effect, a negative effect, where the condo owner with poor credit score
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.520]   and just financial difficulties and living on the edge who got that loan is probably
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.240]   going to default first down the hall in your condo association.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.580]   And then that's going to cause other people to be afraid and maybe sell their property
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.880]   or lower their asking price.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.080]   And it just gets worse and worse and worse until somehow the bottom is hit and people
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   realize, "Hey, the prices of these properties are very attractive according to the rent
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.240]   they generate."
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   I think it's very important for all of us to realize that owning a home is not a right.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.680]   Pre-2008, too many people who really couldn't afford to bought homes.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.160]   While we can certainly blame lenders for lowering their credit standards and coming up with
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:04.040]   creative mortgages to entice unwary borrowers, we should also not shirk personal responsibility
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.280]   for our decisions.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.920]   Nobody's pointing a gun to our head to buy an asset with debt and take on all that risk.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.880]   We need to read the fine print.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:19.040]   We need to look at our finances, do some various scenario analysis, and look at worst case
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   scenarios to see if we can actually afford a property.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.560]   And if we don't do that, bad things could happen.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.240]   So the easiest way to save homebuyers from potential loss and save the economy from potential
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.760]   catastrophe again is to not take out a mortgage until you have a credit score of 720 or higher
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.120]   instead of the current 620 or higher.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.880]   This way, if things go south, default rates won't increase as much as they would for borrowers
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   with lower credit scores.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   Now 720, like I said, in the past, 2014 before then, 720 was pretty good.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.740]   You're probably going to get a pretty good rate.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.140]   But now, I'm telling you folks, it's 760 and probably 800 plus.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.160]   But to get to 800 plus, it takes time.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:11.280]   It's not just about payment history, which is 35% of your credit score, the amounts owed,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.440]   30%.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   But length of credit history is about 15% determining factor of your credit score.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   So it's pretty much impossible to get an 800 credit score in your 20s and in your early
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   30s.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.800]   So what is a person supposed to do?
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.600]   Wait until their 40s and 50s to get an 800 plus?
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   Probably not, right?
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.440]   Because life goes on.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.980]   So I would say at least 720 credit score, if not 760 credit score, that is when you
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.800]   should consider, OK, you're financially ready to buy some property.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.940]   Since 2012, if you look at the data, the housing market has had a tremendous bull run.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:53.720]   Some areas of the country like San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:01.160]   I think even DC, Boston, we're talking 50% to 80% appreciation in property prices since
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.360]   2012.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.920]   That's a lot.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   That's a lot.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.520]   So there should be no urgency to buy a home at near record high prices without the best
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.200]   mortgage terms.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.600]   If you must buy now, you need to get the best terms possible.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.840]   Otherwise, your risk is going up.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.960]   If you lose your job, you change your mind, you get a divorce, whatever could happen,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.320]   generally tends to happen if you're not prepared.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.880]   And you could be in a world of financial hurt if you do not get the best terms possible.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.520]   It's really an interesting time for the housing market right now because you see the S&P 500
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.480]   up 15% plus year to date.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.320]   So that's great compared to history.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.280]   You know, in 2018, not so great, down about 5.5%.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.840]   But this year we've rebounded.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.760]   And in 2020, we're going to have the election year where we're going to get promised all
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.520]   sorts of goodies.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.480]   And I've got to believe that the government and the Fed is going to do everything possible
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.800]   to try to make sure there is no hard landing in the economy.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.960]   Maybe the recession is short.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.360]   There have been two to three month recessions.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.680]   Yeah, maybe the stock market corrects 10%, 15%.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.320]   But I believe that we are not going to experience the level of magnitude of suffering as we
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.640]   did during the previous financial crisis.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:25.800]   So if you're looking for property buy right now, it is a, I think, magical window between
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   now and the end of the year, maybe in January 2020, to look for deals.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.640]   Because I am seeing inventory go up.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.600]   You're seeing a lot of good bargains on the high end.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.920]   And it's always on the high end, the luxury side, where people don't really need a 5,000,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   6,000 square foot mansion or McMansion.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.840]   You know, it's really, there's a lot of deals there to be found.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.240]   Now the median price property in your area, it's obviously going to be a little bit more
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.320]   competitive.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.520]   But even then, I still see opportunity.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.080]   It is back to the grind shortly.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   I do have some special news coming up in a following podcast in a post.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   So stay tuned.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.200]   And if you enjoy the podcast, I'd love a review because it'll help me keep on going.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   I read everything.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.240]   And it's just a wonderful, wonderful to hear from all of you guys, whether in the review
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   section or in the comment section of Financial Samurai.
