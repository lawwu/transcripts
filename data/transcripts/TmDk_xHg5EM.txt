[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.720]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 186.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:18.360]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.400]   joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.720]   Jesse, when this episode airs,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.120]   so not right now, but when this airs,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.120]   I will hopefully be a much more relaxed person.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.520]   You know, as I've talked about on the show,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.200]   and you know all too well,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.880]   I have been in this busy period at Georgetown.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   All good things, we're recruiting,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.840]   we're on campus again, we're meals and seeing people,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.320]   but it's unusual for me,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.760]   basically every day I'm on campus all day.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.620]   It's a lot of moving parts,
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.020]   and that's not usually the way I operate best,
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.380]   and it's a lot stressful, it makes me anxious,
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.400]   I don't sleep very well,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.040]   when I have a million moving parts going on in my schedule,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.480]   and ambiguous logistics, my body just rejects that.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.560]   It's like rejecting a transplanted organ or something,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.160]   it's like, ah!
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.040]   But on Tuesday of this week this comes out,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.640]   that winds down, so when this episode itself airs on
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.380]   Thursday, just imagine me joined like a nice cold beer
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.040]   somewhere with my feet up,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.720]   and my laptop with my email inbox open,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.860]   just smashed in a corner.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.540]   Just straight up office space, beat it with bats,
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.040]   won't be needing you ever again.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.940]   So I'm looking forward to that,
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.500]   I'm looking forward to the future version of me,
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.780]   that's listening to this episode.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.300]   So last week we introduced a new segment,
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.660]   which was crazy or deep, people seem to like.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.540]   So the idea was we introduce a idea,
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.500]   we try to figure out is this like a deep idea,
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.000]   it's embracing the deep life or is it just crazy?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.160]   And so last week, just a quick update on last week's,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.480]   last week's I talked about how I was reading,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.440]   'cause I felt like it was important for my work
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.560]   on the deep life, that I finally read
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320]   Thomas Merton's Seven Story Mountain,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.960]   and I had it on my Kindle and it just wasn't working,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.400]   I wasn't getting into it, and so I bought a version,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.560]   but not just any version, I bought a first edition,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.480]   first print version of the book,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.260]   I figured having the version that people who first
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.160]   encountered that book, read it on,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.780]   would somehow help me read it,
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.060]   and it has by the way, it's been going well,
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.000]   it's a beast of a book, it's 400 something pages long,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   but 1948 hardcover books is not airport business book
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.840]   spacing, this is not the like, well,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.800]   let's kind of double space it and make the margins
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.520]   and put some pictures, this is, these pages are wide,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.080]   and the spacing is narrow, so it's 400,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.440]   you earn those 400 pages,
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.480]   I'm about 200 something pages into it,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.560]   and I think it's really helped to have a hard copy,
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.920]   but here's the update, so Jesse,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.800]   someone wrote me after that episode,
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.000]   and said, they sent me a photo,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.400]   they had the exact same issue,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.560]   the Kindle wasn't doing it for them,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.480]   and they went out and bought an old hardcover version,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.440]   and they sent me a photo of it, they had it,
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.040]   they had done the exact same thing,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.560]   so I think that really makes sure that deep,
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.140]   not crazy was the answer on that one.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.060]   - Yes sir, that's good stuff.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.740]   - All right, so let's do another crazy deep,
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.740]   now this one is about other people, maybe about me one day,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.620]   this is something I've been hearing about a lot,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.880]   so Jesse, you're the arbiter here, all right,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.380]   writers opening up bookstores,
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.100]   I'm gonna give you some background on this, okay,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.180]   so friend of the show, Ryan Holiday,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.180]   has his bookstore in Boss Drop outside of Austin,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.580]   what's it, the Painted Porch,
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.060]   other writers have done this, Anne Patchett has a bookstore
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.340]   in Tennessee, Anne Rice,
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.620]   who actually I think just recently died like this year,
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.860]   but she had a bookstore in New Orleans,
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.740]   the latest addition to this long list of people,
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.740]   authors doing bookstores is,
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.340]   remember we did Brandon Sanderson,
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.500]   who did that Kickstarter for the whatever million dollars,
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.700]   Brandon Sanderson, who wrote "The Name of the Wind",
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.300]   I just want Jesse to get a lot of mad emails
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.820]   by misappropriated, giving the wrong name for his book,
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.460]   no, no, of course, Brandon Sanderson,
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.680]   who wrote "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.540]   Brandon Sanderson, author of the "Harry Potter" trilogy,
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.500]   I just want Jesse to get emails from mad fantasy fans,
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.700]   but anyways, Brandon Sanderson,
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.580]   who I know who he is for sure,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.540]   posted an FAQ and a reader sent this to me,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.380]   it's really interesting,
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.780]   and actually I would recommend people Google this,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.340]   because he actually gets into like,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.420]   here's how many copies I sold of this book,
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.100]   and this is how many copies I sold of this book,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.500]   and he's getting to the economics of the Kickstarter,
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.820]   and he just opens up the kimono,
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.220]   and was like, here's how much money I make,
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.860]   and here's how much money I think I'm gonna make
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.620]   on this Kickstarter, but in the FAQ,
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.820]   they're asking him, what are you gonna do with the money?
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.980]   And he goes, as we talked about, he goes to the math,
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.580]   and like, look, this money is going to pay for the books,
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.980]   so like, it's not like I get to keep all this money,
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.700]   but what it's gonna give me is maybe
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.180]   a slightly higher royalty rate, but whatever,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.900]   he said, one of our ideas is we're gonna start
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.540]   a physical bookstore, so Brandon Sanderson
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.980]   is also gonna start a physical bookstore,
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.260]   so a lot of people do this, a lot of people do this,
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.640]   so before I go out and buy some Tacoma real estate,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.700]   let me ask Jesse, crazy or deep,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   for a writer to own one of the least profitable,
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.620]   most precarious businesses you can buy today,
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.420]   your own bookstore?
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.740]   - Deep. - Deep?
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.500]   - Deep. - You support it?
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.580]   - I support it. - All right.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.300]   How would we make that work?
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.780]   See, I think if we podcast out of it,
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.860]   that would help name recognition.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.020]   - It'd kinda be like the version of Mr. Money Mustache's,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.140]   you know, office that he has in Colorado.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.060]   - That's true, Longmont, yeah.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.740]   - You could have some cool things in there.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.700]   - Yeah. - Put a little gym in the back.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.300]   I think the key is, maybe Ryan told us to,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.380]   but the key is you can't depend on the book sales
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.660]   to be what makes it work.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.100]   - No. - That's the reality.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.900]   But if you already have a name and you're known
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.700]   and there's other things going on there,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.060]   I mean, okay, so right away I was thinking
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.720]   if we podcast out of there,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.860]   just think about our overhead and lease payments
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.340]   for this HQ, you could just imagine that
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.860]   as money in the pocket of the bookstore, right?
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.420]   So like, okay, we could kinda pay the bookstore for that.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.380]   So that's already gonna help a little bit.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.860]   And co-working space,
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.420]   this is like the Mr. Money Mustache thing.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.860]   Like some of the things that happens there
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.660]   is he has people come and work.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.500]   You wouldn't need many,
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.740]   but like some really nice co-working spaces,
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.540]   I don't know, we could figure it out.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.780]   Or just like lose a little bit of money on it
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.580]   because it's awesome.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.980]   - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.300]   - You could just sit like in a nice chair
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.220]   and like read and sip coffee and be in the middle.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.980]   It would have to be in the middle of Tacoma Park.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.820]   I mean, I think--
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.780]   - Yes, 'cause you could walk there.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.620]   - Yeah.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.900]   - Or you're in between coffee shops.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.940]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.460]   All right, so Jesse gives that,
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.580]   audience, you can weigh in.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.100]   Jesse gives that a deep, not crazy designation,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.140]   writers starting their own physical bookshops.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.980]   So--
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.700]   - What does Ryan say about his?
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.580]   - I think, I mean, Ryan's advice is
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.820]   don't buy property to start a bookstore
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.540]   two months before a pandemic hits.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.220]   I would say that would probably be his main advice
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.020]   because that's pretty stressful,
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.060]   but I think it's rock and rolling now.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.220]   Yeah, I think it's going well.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.500]   But Ryan has that great reading list email newsletter.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.460]   He has like 100,000 subscribers.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.180]   And that now points people towards
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.340]   buy the book through Painted Porch.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.620]   So I think that helps, right?
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.220]   So like he just has this great relationship
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.540]   with a lot, big readership
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.420]   who takes his reading recommendations or whatever.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.780]   But also I think, I'm sure if we talk to him,
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.940]   if we got him on the show to talk about it,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.100]   it's like the way I would think about it too,
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.260]   which is, it's not just a,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.340]   part of the value of this place
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.140]   is not just the dollars that come in from book sales,
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.460]   but it's like a place for him to work.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.860]   It's a place for him to do his podcasting.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.300]   It's a place for him to leave his ranch
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.140]   and do his interviews.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.660]   Like that's pretty valuable too.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.500]   Like there's that, I think it's that double dipping value
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.100]   of like, as a writer, this is a place for me to go
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.980]   and it can be at the center of my operations
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.020]   and my brand as a writer.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.660]   So if you think about it more like reasonably priced,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.260]   this is terrible economics.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.700]   We're gonna get yelled at by so many like actual people
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.540]   who know about business,
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.940]   but here's, okay, let me try to justify myself, Jesse.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.620]   You think about it like it's reasonably priced office space
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.100]   because it's subsidized by the book sales.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.460]   So it's, you know,
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.540]   so if you had a bookstore that was losing you,
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.940]   you know, $2,000 a month,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.500]   but you had your whole writer business out of it,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.260]   you'd be like, this is a pretty nice space
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.260]   for $2,000 a month.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.540]   Like you could think about it that way.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.040]   I think that's probably terrible economics and is,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.740]   but that's my justification.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.100]   - What's the closest book store around here?
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.580]   - I mean, there's a Busboys and Poets here,
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.500]   which has limited book selection.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.980]   That's in Tacoma.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.660]   But otherwise I go to Politics and Prose.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.340]   - Yeah, which is like two miles away.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.260]   - Yeah, yeah, I go to Politics and Prose.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.660]   There used to be some old timers were telling us
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.980]   there used to be a used bookstore here,
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.820]   long time ago.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.000]   So there is precedent.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.580]   And you know, Ryan does,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.980]   he doesn't try to do the Politics and Prose thing,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.940]   which is you try to have a fully fledged inventory.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.580]   So it's 60,000 books,
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.900]   whatever is a fully fledged inventory.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.460]   Ryan does only curated face out.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.660]   So it's like their thing,
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.700]   because it's like the reading list email newsletter
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.820]   made physical.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.660]   So you go into his store,
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.340]   it's not like, oh, I'm looking for this book.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.220]   And so I'm gonna go to this bookstore
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.180]   that has 60,000 books and hopefully find it.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.700]   It's more like, I wanna get a good book.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.460]   And so if I go to Ryan's store, it's all curated.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.740]   It's all books he likes, it's all face out,
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.580]   which is kind of an interesting model.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.900]   I guess you're selling more of an experience
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.100]   or something like that.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.340]   All right, so we'll have to start a bookstore, I guess.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.500]   - Sounds good.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.980]   I'll work the cash register.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.500]   - Yeah.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.420]   All right, but anyways, we have,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.620]   we have calls, which I'm looking forward to.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.260]   Briefly before we jump in the calls,
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.260]   let's talk for a moment about Magic Mind.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.460]   Magic Mind sells this magic little elixir
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.940]   that comes in these small bottles
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.940]   that you take once in the morning
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.940]   to give yourself a smooth, non jittery, focused energy.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.460]   So you can either replace your morning coffee with this
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.260]   or have it along with your morning coffee.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.340]   I have found that if I take the Magic Mind shot
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.580]   with my first cup of coffee,
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.740]   I can avoid that feeling, that crash
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.220]   that makes me wanna have four, five,
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.380]   six more cups of coffee afterwards.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.260]   One cup of coffee plus Magic Mind
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.900]   as my new optimal combination.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.100]   Magic Mind comes with 12 functional ingredients
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.980]   that deliver that sustainable, productive energy.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.900]   It's like bottling productivity.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.220]   One of the ingredients is three drops of my blood.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.100]   So it's just the essence of Cal Newport productivity.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.740]   Now I make a matcha, nootropics, adaptogens.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.860]   It's actually really good stuff.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.420]   And they gave us a code, Deep20.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.420]   So if you go to magicmind.co/deep,
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.220]   you go to that page and then type in the code Deep20
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.060]   at checkout, you'll get 25% off.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.700]   You know, Jesse, something I didn't realize
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.340]   is that the founder of Magic Mind, James Bechara,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.340]   I talked to him, right?
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.340]   I like to know who I'm in business with
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.580]   and selective about my sponsors
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.620]   and enjoy talking with him.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.260]   But it turned out like this was his thing in Silicon Valley
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.060]   before he started this company.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.060]   He was known as the nootropic focused substance.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.420]   Like, you know, it matters what you intake in your body
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.420]   because your mind is your best instrument.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.420]   Like this was his thing.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.340]   So for Silicon Valley types, like,
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.860]   oh, it's James' company.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.060]   Makes sense.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.100]   So that's Magic Mind.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.100]   And again, if you go to magicmind.co/deep
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.500]   and use that discount code, Deep20,
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.340]   you will get 25% off your purchase.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.500]   Magic Mind is your best choice
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.140]   when it comes to getting more done in less time.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.100]   I also wanna talk briefly about Monk Pack,
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.580]   Keto Nut and Seed Bars,
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.100]   a go-to snack when I need some food,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.540]   but I don't want a sugar crash.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.980]   The Monk Pack Keto Nut and Seed Bars taste really good.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.860]   They have crunchy and sweet.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.620]   You have the nuts on top and it's more soft underneath.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.060]   They have fantastic flavors.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.380]   Sea salt, dark chocolate, caramel sea salt
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.020]   and peanut butter, dark chocolate.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.820]   Peanut butter is the best if you want my opinion,
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.540]   but here's the thing about them.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.220]   One gram of sugar, only two to three grams of net carbs,
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.500]   only 150 calories.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.900]   You grab this thing that you think is a sugar explosion
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.060]   and it's not.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.300]   It's a keto-friendly bar, so you don't get that crash.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.780]   So it's a fantastic snack when you feel that urge,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.940]   but don't want to crash.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.380]   In addition to the keto-friendliness,
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.300]   they're gluten-free, plant-based, non-GMO
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.340]   with no soy, trans fat, sugar, alcohols
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.980]   or artificial colors.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.140]   So try it for yourself and you'll see,
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.420]   we even have a special deal for you, our listeners.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.500]   You will get 25% off your first purchase

[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.620]   All right.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.460]   Jesse, I think it's time to do some calls.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.220]   We have a brand new piece of equipment in the HQ here.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.340]   Joe, the audio engineer extraordinaire
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.900]   gave us some sort of magic box
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.380]   that sits between Jesse's laptop and our soundboard
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.140]   to help do something with the questions
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.380]   that are coming in over it.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.860]   I think it makes the question smarter.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.780]   Is that what the box does?
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.860]   - Questions are pretty smart, but yeah, it makes it clearer.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.740]   - Yeah, it makes it clearer.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.820]   So, which means like almost certainly
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.860]   when we play this first question,
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.580]   you're just gonna see flames.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.580]   It's like shoot out from the mixing board onto my head
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.860]   and then my hair is gonna catch on fire
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.700]   because that's about where we are technically speaking.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.060]   That's my impression of like Joe here working our equipment
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.060]   and we're there.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.540]   He's like doing all this complicated stuff
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.860]   and then I'm slowly reaching over to press something.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.340]   He's like, "Don't touch that."
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.940]   And that's basically it.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.500]   - You guys were having some good conversations.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.700]   I was just kind of in the background
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.780]   just understanding maybe 20% of what you guys were saying.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.140]   - I know.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.020]   This is the skill of a nonfiction journalist and writer.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.260]   I can sound confident about almost anything.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.020]   So you probably picked up.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.020]   I can pick up from like the things you're saying,
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.220]   like vocabulary and put them into a structure
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.740]   and then mimic them back in a way
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.380]   that sounds like I know what I'm talking about.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.860]   It's all a parlor trick.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.820]   Because like, that's what it is
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.980]   if you're writing like a big long form piece or a book,
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.620]   or like you have to bring in all this information
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.500]   and sound confident about it,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.660]   but you know, like you can't master
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.900]   every single thing you're writing about.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.700]   So I am a professionally trained BS artist.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.860]   Like I had lunch the other day with a critical theorist
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.900]   and I know some critical theory,
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.820]   but like this guy was like cutting edge critical theorist,
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.420]   you know, and I was just able to pick up
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.260]   from the conversation.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.100]   These are names of complex theories
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.460]   and be able to like, I bet I understand what that means
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.900]   and how this would relate to it.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.660]   And kind of sound like I knew what I was talking about,
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.300]   like a little bit with, you know, post-humanism
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   and right, anyways, right.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.420]   It's complicated, irreducible, irreducible systems.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.260]   But that's my thing.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260]   I can like very quickly get enough out of you
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.740]   to sound like I kind of know enough.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.700]   But if we talk for five more minutes,
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.780]   you're gonna be like, wait a second.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.700]   You don't know anything about this.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.860]   So it's a skill that is useful in like a very narrow,
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.580]   very narrow applications.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.140]   All right, so who do we have here?
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.660]   What do we got for our first call?
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.380]   - All right, the first question we have
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.020]   is about day batching.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.220]   So we'll take a listen.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.700]   - Hi, Kyle.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.540]   I'm Giacomo, a UX designer
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.820]   with a background in adult education.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.460]   I have two questions for you.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.980]   First, what are your thoughts on day batching?
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:56.740]   Jeff Dorsey, ex-CEO of Twitter, uses this approach.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.100]   Would you recommend day batching to someone that,
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.620]   like me, has several hats to wear?
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.940]   And second, how do you find balance
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.620]   between planning and spontaneity?
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.060]   One of my favorite thinkers, Massim Nicolas Taleb,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.100]   discourages readers on planning their time.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.980]   He suggests to let your curiosity, BS detector,
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.740]   and boredom avoidance guide your activities.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.820]   Just make sure to set limits on things
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.700]   that do not help you focus, say social media.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.220]   Since I know that you're familiar with his work,
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.260]   I've read your thoughts on his book "Antifragile."
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.140]   I wonder if you have any recommendations on this approach.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.180]   Wish you and your family a merry, merry Christmas.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.700]   - All right, well, first of all, Jesse,
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.860]   I think the cat's out of the bag
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.900]   that we build up these questions
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.900]   over a long period of time before we answer them.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.340]   They might've heard the evergreen nature of this question,
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.460]   the hat, merry Christmas.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.300]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.620]   I mean, I have a big audience and it's,
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.260]   you know, I get a lot of questions that go through.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.140]   - Yeah, yeah, but I'm glad we got to it.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.980]   I think it's a good one
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.220]   because there's two pieces in there.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.980]   First of all, day batching was a term I didn't,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.140]   I hadn't been using, but I'm gonna use it now.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.140]   So Giacomo, you've invented a term that I like, day batching.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.460]   And so for people who don't know what he's talking about,
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.420]   day batching is essentially where you say,
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.580]   this day I work on this, this day I work on that, right?
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.300]   So you're dedicating whole days to one activity
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.660]   or one job or one type of role.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.180]   And Jack Dorsey used to do that.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.980]   I guess he probably still does, but he was doing that.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.740]   I guess he's no longer the CEO of Twitter,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.620]   but when he was the CEO of Twitter and Square,
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.580]   he had different days for the different companies.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.940]   I'm a big believer in it.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.180]   I'm a believer in it when that is applicable
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.100]   to your situation.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.140]   And the reason why I am is because it does a great job
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.540]   at avoiding unnecessary context switching.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.980]   This is the biggest issue when you wear multiple hats
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.780]   or like me have 17 jobs.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.540]   It's not that the total amount of work
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.660]   of these different hats or jobs adds up to be too much.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.020]   It's the context switching.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.900]   I'm trying to work on this role,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.460]   but also answering emails about that role.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.140]   I'm trying to switch from this type of activity
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.860]   to a completely unrelated activity
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.380]   in the same day back to back.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.140]   There's a real cost in terms of how long it takes
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.340]   for you to adjust your focus.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.380]   It also just creates drag and you burn out easier.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.660]   So when you have a full day dedicated to just one thing,
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.220]   that's all you're doing in your mind.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.700]   Your mind is just in that context
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.340]   and it can completely forget,
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.300]   expend no energy on open obligations, questions,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.260]   and work from the other context.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.540]   You're gonna get a lot more done.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.100]   You're gonna be a lot less burnt out.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.700]   So when it is possible, when you have multiple clear roles,
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.140]   I like that configuration better than, for example,
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.340]   half day, half day, right?
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.980]   So if you want to compare this to,
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.940]   I work on this role in the morning
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.740]   and that role in the afternoon,
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.700]   that's worse than this day is for this role,
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.300]   that day is for that role, right?
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.540]   So I like the idea of day batching where possible.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.660]   We do something like that here at the podcast.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.260]   So, I mean, I've talked about this before.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.660]   For now, while I'm in an academic semester,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.660]   I give the podcast a half day, one half day per week.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.940]   So it's not a full day.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.460]   I can't afford a full day, but,
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.420]   what do you say, Jesse,
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.260]   like an extended half day probably, right?
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.820]   You know, sort of like today we're doing noon to five.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.100]   And then I say, that's all I do during that time.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.380]   And I try to consolidate as much as possible to that time
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.420]   when I'm here and Jesse's here
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.260]   and let's get through the things,
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.100]   let's talk things through.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.500]   I want to be just in that context while I'm here.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.620]   And then I try to optimize it.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.500]   Like, let's make as much progress as we can,
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.580]   but within that time.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.260]   And actually that's a side effect of this
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260]   is that this is an unrelated issue,
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.340]   but it's a fixed schedule productivity issue
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.860]   that when you give yourself these fixed limits,
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.460]   it still enables ambitious growth
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.300]   because you can say during this time,
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.140]   I want to do as much as we can,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.540]   but it also puts limits on that time.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.220]   So you're not just spending all of your time,
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.060]   you know, working on it
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.300]   and it takes over the rest of your life.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.180]   So I like day batching.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.740]   I like day batching when it is possible.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.900]   And if you're going to do it, do it.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.220]   Have separate email inboxes.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.380]   Don't let any of the old world come into the new world,
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.740]   if at all possible.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.580]   I think it's a great hack.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.620]   All right, so what about this Tlaib question,
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.780]   planning versus spontaneity?
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.300]   You need to keep in mind that Tlaib
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.420]   is in a rarefied position
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.980]   in terms of the flexibility he has with his time.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.580]   So we have to have some wariness
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.980]   generalizing a complete non-plan
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.980]   curiosity driven approach to your day.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.340]   That's not going to be relevant
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.260]   to 99% of the working world,
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.540]   where it's, well, I have this job
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.780]   with all these obligations and there's deadlines
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.260]   and things have to get done.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.820]   And in that situation, what is the binary?
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.140]   Organization or no organization?
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.580]   You're going to try to have an intentional way
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.540]   of making sense of the stuff on your plate,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.860]   some sort of system and plan
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.820]   for trying to get things done
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.740]   at a reasonable level of quality and timeliness or not.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.980]   And not means chaos.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.860]   So once you have non-trivial amount of things on your plate,
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.100]   you have to do some sort of organizational system
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.980]   to avoid chaos.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.260]   If you have nothing on your plate, then yeah,
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.540]   don't bother, I suppose.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.260]   But once you do, you need some sort of system
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.180]   to avoid chaos.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.980]   And these are the type of things I talk about.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.940]   Now you want to have capture, configure, control, et cetera,
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.060]   or whatever it is you enjoy.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.740]   I think there's a different issue here, however,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.740]   and this might be what Tlaib is actually leaning towards,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.820]   which is, do you want to map out
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.740]   like everything you're going to do with your time?
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.660]   Like here's my master plan, I have my work,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.660]   but even outside of work,
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.380]   I'm working on this project and that project,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.740]   and there's no room for spontaneity.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.900]   And he's saying, that's a problem.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.420]   That I would agree with.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   So the work you have to do,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.740]   it's better to have an organizational system versus not.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.180]   If you don't, then it's just chaos.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.380]   And the work doesn't go away,
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.180]   it just gets done worse and you're more stressed.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.020]   But in terms of where you have control,
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.820]   your time after work, your weekends,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.300]   maybe you've pulled back your job,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.020]   not to be a full-time job,
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.900]   Tlaib's warning probably is one worth heeding.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.420]   Don't fill every minute of the time you have control over.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.940]   Don't say, I'm going to figure out in advance,
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.780]   here's what I'm going to do
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.980]   with all the other aspects of my life.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.100]   Give yourself some room there.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.740]   I like that idea for spontaneity.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.740]   I'm going to read, I'm going to see how I feel.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.820]   I'm going to go to the woods
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.340]   and we'll just see what happens.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.940]   I think there's some merit to that as well.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.860]   I actually talked about that in my third book,
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.740]   "How to Become a High School Superstar."
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.420]   I had an idea I called under-scheduling.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.260]   And I was pitching this idea to high school kids,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.340]   American high school kids.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.180]   Have less on your plate than you have time to accomplish.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.660]   This is very scary for kids
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.740]   who are worried about college admissions.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.340]   But in that extra time,
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.220]   you can be curious and explore
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.020]   and stumble and wander into things.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.500]   That was the key to becoming interesting
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.980]   and you want to become interesting.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.820]   And so I think we're on the same wavelength.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.420]   But what I'm saying is, Giacomo,
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.100]   the stuff you have to do, organize the hell out of it.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.580]   In fact, that'll probably leave you more time to wander,
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.820]   but then be cautious or conservative
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.300]   with how much you structure the time that remains.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.620]   All right, Jesse, what do we got coming up next?
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.300]   - All right, next question.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.260]   It's about burnout.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.180]   He's a student, so did some time blocking.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.180]   We'll take a listen.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.380]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.260]   First of all, thanks so much for your podcast.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.540]   I think it's incredible
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.700]   and it's definitely changed my life for the better.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.900]   And it seems many others were very grateful.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.860]   So my question is about burning out
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.580]   and making sustainable work for long periods of time.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.380]   I, after last semester, after time blocking,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.300]   towards the end of my time block,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.060]   blocking towards of the end of the semester,
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.620]   I overdid it to meet a bunch of paper deadlines
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.580]   as a computer scientist researcher, just like you.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.380]   I definitely think I overdid it and worked too much
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.140]   and that burned me out.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.260]   And that was a little bit mainly because,
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.820]   you know, I'm getting to be better at productivity planning,
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.140]   scheduling, et cetera.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.380]   I think I fixed that.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.220]   But now I need like two weeks of vacation,
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.020]   which is a week longer than I wish I needed.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.540]   So my question is, how do you make it sustainable
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.420]   to do time blocking?
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.860]   Especially when, for example,
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.380]   when I see how you keep in the face of repetitive tasks,
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.860]   like you need to face the same thing again and again
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.220]   and again, like programming.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.820]   And, you know, I need to program all the time.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.340]   I need to do math all the time.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.100]   And I don't know if it gets repetitive,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.500]   but how do you manage to have to do the same thing
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.180]   many times without burning out?
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.500]   For example, your podcast,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.740]   I'm sure you ask the same questions so many,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.780]   answer the same questions so many times.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.820]   Sometimes I marvel how you don't get bored at doing this.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.540]   Thank God you don't, but tell us the secret.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.380]   Thank you so much.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.220]   You're wonderful.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:01.700]   - Well, let's start with that last mini question first.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.260]   So yes, I do come back to the same topics often.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.260]   And I call that the Dave Ramsey strategy.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.020]   I learned it from the Dave Ramsey Personal Finance
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.980]   radio show, which is very popular.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.980]   I think it's like 8 million average daily listeners.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.420]   And he comes back to the same things again and again
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.620]   and again, and it's actually at the core of the show,
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.820]   remembering that A, not everyone's listening
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.100]   to every episode, but B, people often want reinforcement
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.180]   for a lifestyle that is appealing
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.140]   and hearing it again and again is not negative.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.140]   It's actually positive.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.540]   That being said, I think you'll notice that
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.860]   Justin and I are pretty careful in our question selection
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.660]   that we evolve the set of questions that we work on.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.700]   So like within a period of, I don't know, a month or so,
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.860]   you might hear the same question again and again.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.460]   But if you go back to six months ago,
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.420]   you'll see the overlap is kind of less.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.380]   You see as we change our focus, the questions change focus,
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.260]   we sort of drift around.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.540]   So it's not like we're answering the exact same questions
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.260]   every time, but that's the philosophy there.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.100]   And I don't mind it.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.860]   I mean, I think everyone has their own take on it.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.900]   I like refining my answer and I think it does some good.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.380]   All right, let's talk about this burnout issue.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.660]   'Cause I think there's two things I wanna tell you.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.660]   One, especially in academia, seasonality is fine.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.500]   I work really hard for a deadline
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.860]   and then I do almost nothing for a week or two afterwards
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.860]   is actually I think not an unusual scheduling move
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.540]   for an academic.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.980]   It's very seasonal job.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.900]   Busy periods, unbusy periods.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.380]   Summer is low, fall exam period is high.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.860]   Paper deadline is a really busy period.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.100]   A month after the paper deadline is where you're recharged.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.420]   So I want you to lean into in the academic life being uneven
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.940]   and the key to that is leaning into the rest
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.940]   as hard as you lean into the peaks,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.700]   leaning into those troughs as hard as you lean into the peak.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.420]   So don't be worried about taking two weeks off.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.700]   You can have months that are slow
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.340]   and months that are hard, yin yang, balance that out.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.420]   And I don't want you to worry about that
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.020]   because there is necessarily in your chosen career
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.160]   intense busy periods surrounding deadlines, et cetera.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.080]   Secondly though, and this is gonna be a different take
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.920]   on this issue.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.180]   So you have two ways of tackling this burnout.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:27.080]   One of the powers of time blocking,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.840]   so getting really intentional about your time
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.660]   and in particular when you do time blocking
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.200]   with weekly planning and weekly planning
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.040]   with quarterly or semester planning
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.540]   is that it enables you to work less hours.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.720]   So where a lot of people get in trouble
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.680]   and I've been here before is you get organized
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.480]   so you're doing time blocking with your day
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.920]   based off a smart weekly plan,
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.360]   based off of a semester plan.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.920]   You're getting things done.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.680]   You're getting a lot of bang for your time buck
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.600]   because you're choosing when you work,
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.280]   you're not distracting, you're not context switching
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.780]   and you're getting things done at a fast rate.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.960]   The instinct a lot of high achievers have is great,
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.040]   now I can fit more into my day.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.880]   And you're not compensating for the fact
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   that it's higher energy, it's higher demand,
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.760]   it's intense what you're doing.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.260]   And then you overdo it.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.080]   And you're like, I always worked eight hours days.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.340]   Why am I now so exhausted?
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.560]   Because before you were working eight hour days
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.800]   but you had email open
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.640]   and you would go down internet rabbit holes
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.360]   and you were at the coffee maker.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.400]   Now that you're time blocking,
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200]   it's this 90 minutes you didn't look up
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.380]   and then you had a 10 minute break
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.560]   and then you were, it's all so packed.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.800]   And so what you need to do once you get organized
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.960]   and structured about your time
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.360]   is to use that newfound superpower to work less hours.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.080]   It's what's gonna give you confidence to say,
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.760]   I'm not working on Friday this week
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.800]   'cause I have a weekly plan
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.680]   that's in line with my semester plan
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.280]   and my time block plan makes sure
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.840]   that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.400]   I'm getting done what needs to get done.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.640]   And so with complete confidence,
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.980]   I can take Friday completely off.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.220]   It's what lets you say,
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.620]   I'm gonna stop working at three every day this week
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.260]   because I have some new crazy workout routine
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.800]   or I'm gonna start training for a triathlon
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.480]   and I have a group of runners
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.560]   and then we're gonna do the bike training
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.400]   or whatever you're gonna do.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.640]   It gives you confidence to do that
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.320]   because you can see the plan,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.560]   you can see how it's gonna unfold.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.200]   So you have a lot of flexibility
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.700]   as a computer science student, as a training academic.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.920]   Let time blocking
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.100]   and the associated time management strategies
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.520]   give you much more interesting control over that time.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.080]   I want your schedule to look decidedly different
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.700]   than all your friends who,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.520]   instead of going into grad school with their training,
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.920]   went to finance jobs or went to developer jobs.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.040]   I want you to have a schedule that feels very different.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.880]   Whole weeks where you're not working,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   days you don't work, afternoons you don't work.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.640]   Like where you're taking control of your schedule.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.900]   You're taking advantage of that intense focus
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.660]   that you're able to get out of your time block
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.720]   to build a schedule that's very sustainable and interesting.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.120]   So put those two together.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.520]   Seasonality is fine, hard periods balance with easy,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.360]   don't feel guilty.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.880]   Two, don't work so much.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.280]   You listen to my podcast, you're good at what you do,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.880]   you're good at structuring your time,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.840]   take advantage of that.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.560]   And just keep in mind, when I was in your position,
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.680]   when I was a grad student at MIT studying computer science,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.760]   I was doing multiple other things.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.120]   I was writing books,
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.760]   I was running a three time a week essays
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.240]   on the Study Hacks blog.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   Once we had a dog, I was doing like long walks and exercise.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.960]   I never worked outside of nine to five hours.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.840]   I didn't work in the evenings
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.640]   except for before deadlines.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.400]   I fit that all in.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.620]   So the actual amount of computer science work I was doing
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.360]   was maybe halftime at best.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   And again, it's because time blocking,
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.960]   weekly planning, these things work.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.320]   So Brando, lean into your flexibility
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.040]   and build a cool schedule.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.680]   I've learned, Jesse, to stop telling PhD students
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.040]   that are stressed about their dissertation.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.840]   To stop telling them that,
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.680]   A, when it came time to write my dissertation,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.320]   instead of just generalizing work I'd already done,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.440]   I started a new thing from scratch.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.280]   And B, I wrote a book at the same time.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   Because I was bored.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.400]   'Cause we were writing your dissertation,
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.440]   they're like, this is all you should be doing,
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   is writing your dissertation.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.160]   And I was like, okay, I mean,
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.520]   I can spend a few hours on this a day.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.120]   What else am I supposed to do?
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.360]   And I used to get, there's such a subculture back then
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.320]   of, I call it the dissertation hell subculture.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.440]   Where it's all just self-flagellating grad students
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   about like, no one has gone through a harder trial
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.160]   than I have gone through writing a dissertation.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.600]   'Cause I am not sure if this chapter is good
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.840]   or how long I have to research.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.440]   And I was like, guys, this is a crazy easy job.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.080]   You have a lot of time to write this one thing.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.120]   I'd already written three,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.360]   I was on my third book at the time.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   I was like, I've already written two books, unrelated.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.000]   Like, it's not so bad.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.720]   Most grad schools want you to get the PhD.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   It's not, we are going to, good luck,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.520]   getting past our murder boards of investigations.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.800]   They're like, yeah, we know you,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.240]   you've published a bunch of, it's fine, good, yay.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.960]   And so I never got that dissertation hell.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.600]   I was like, this is an unforced error.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.960]   This like, we have to self-flagellate
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.040]   and pretend like this is the hardest thing
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.960]   anyone's ever done.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.320]   But I learned graduate students going through it
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.280]   don't appreciate me talking about writing my book
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.000]   concurrently with my dissertation.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.600]   And it doesn't make them feel better.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.320]   Just makes them kind of mad at me.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.760]   - I can imagine.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.600]   - Yeah.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.400]   - All right, speaking of which, what do we got next?
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.960]   - Okay, next question.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.640]   It's about basically earning money versus building things
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.760]   and discusses Andrew Yang's book,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.080]   "Smart People Should Build Things."
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.240]   - Hi, Cal Newport.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.080]   I am a huge fan of your work.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.560]   I wanted to ask about advice in "So Good"
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.080]   that they can't ignore you.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.960]   You quote Sivers suggesting that
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.400]   when making early career choices,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.800]   people should consider money as a mutual indicator of value.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   I recently read the book,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.560]   "Smart People Should Build Things" by Andrew Yang,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.200]   which provides an example of where this mindset
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.680]   may be hurtful to society.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.440]   He argues that a desire to maximize career
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.960]   and financial capital drive students from elite institutions
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.200]   to end up taking more specialized large city
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.160]   and company jobs that have dubious beneficial,
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.520]   if not outright negative real world impact.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.320]   They might instead provide the most value for society
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.240]   and potentially feel more satisfied
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.880]   if they took harder jobs in less known cities.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.200]   For example, a student graduating from an Ivy League
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.040]   might be doing leverage buyouts
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.640]   for a large investment banking firm in New York
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.240]   making $200,000 a year,
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.960]   as opposed to running financials
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   for an energy startup in Detroit at 60K.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.520]   While Andrew Yang focuses on jobs
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.240]   in the financial and consulting sector,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   his advice seems to be relevant across most industries.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.840]   I'm curious how you would reconcile his perspective,
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.560]   your advice from "So Good" that they can't ignore you.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.320]   - Well, I like this question
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.880]   and I'm gonna answer it in two parts.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   So first, I'm gonna clarify the Derek Sivers idea
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.840]   that I talked about in "So Good I Can't Ignore You"
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.280]   because I think you have a misinterpretation.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.720]   And once we fix the interpretation,
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   you'll see that it's not in contention with Yang's idea.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.560]   And then let's talk about Yang's idea by itself.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.000]   All right, so this is one of the most,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.560]   this Derek Sivers quote I use in "So Good I Can't Ignore You"
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.040]   is one of the most, I would say,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.240]   misunderstood ideas from my books.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.080]   So I use this quote where Derek said,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   "Money is a good neutral indicator of value."
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.120]   And a lot of people interpreted that to mean
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.600]   money is a good neutral indicator value,
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   indicator of how valuable or good a job is.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   So that if a job pays more money,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.640]   that is a better or more valuable job
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.240]   than one that pays less.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.560]   That's the interpretation I think
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.640]   that would run counter to Yang.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   Because that interpretation would say,
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.480]   yeah, an elite specialized job is gonna pay more
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.560]   than a more pragmatic, less specialized job.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.280]   So the elite job would be better.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.360]   So that would run contrary,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.040]   but that's not the interpretation I meant.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.000]   So what Derek meant with that quote
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.160]   and the way that I actually use that quote
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.240]   is when you are trying to evaluate
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.080]   if a particular product or idea is good,
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.760]   you see if people will pay for it.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   And the idea that's there is that
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.040]   the alternative is to ask people,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.160]   is this idea good?
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.120]   Is this product good?
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.880]   And Derek's point, which I agree with,
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.320]   is that people will give you bad advice.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.600]   They don't want you to feel bad.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.520]   They'll be like, yeah,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.360]   yeah, your idea to start a bookstore sounds great.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.120]   You should definitely do that.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.480]   That's definitely not crazy, right?
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.920]   Or yeah, yeah, your startup idea sounds good.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.560]   You should quit your job and go do that startup.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.400]   Follow your dreams.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.240]   Let's do it.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.080]   Let's get after it, right?
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.160]   It's easy to say that.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.760]   And Derek's point was people don't care
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.160]   about giving you positive feedback,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.600]   but people do not give up money easily.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.520]   They won't give you money unless they actually value it.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.160]   So you see, I do a pop-up bookstore.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.840]   Did I sell any books?
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   Oh, now I could see the people around here
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.680]   actually wanna buy books from me.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.760]   Or here's my startup idea.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.800]   Well, why don't I do it on the side in a limited way
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.000]   and see if we can get clients to give me a check?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.360]   'Cause if no one's writing me a check,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   then this service must not be that compelling
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.080]   or they must not trust me to do it.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.240]   So that's what Sivers was doing.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.480]   It was when you're trying to get feedback
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.800]   on an idea or product,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.000]   put it into a situation where people have to pay for it.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.200]   And if they do, then you say,
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.720]   okay, this must be useful to people.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.640]   And if they don't, they don't.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.560]   And the way that Derek deployed this concept
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.280]   in his own career is that he had a lot of shifts
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.440]   where he transitioned from one type of job to another.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.760]   And he used this principle to help figure out
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.280]   whether or not he should make the shift.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.600]   So he left the desk job to be a full-time musician,
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.440]   for example.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.120]   And he waited until he was making a sizable fraction
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.600]   of his income at a desk job,
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.840]   a sizable fraction of that income
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.560]   as a performing musician on the side.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.040]   He's like, okay, that's my indication
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.880]   that I must be good at this.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.240]   And then he quit and did that.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.480]   And then he started a music company called CD Baby
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.560]   as a pre iTunes custom CD company.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.600]   And he ran it on the side until it was making
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.440]   a certain amount of money.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.520]   And he said, okay, that's how I know this is a good idea
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.120]   'cause it's making a certain amount of money.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.960]   Now I will quit music and do this full-time.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.400]   So he used money, not people's opinions
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.320]   as the best indicator whether an idea was good or viable.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.880]   That's very different than trying to rank order things.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.000]   So he wouldn't say, how much money would you get
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.720]   for various things that tells you what's better?
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.040]   No, no, he's like, you come up with the idea
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.320]   that I love this idea because I love what it stands for.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.680]   I think it's gonna impact the world.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.200]   I like the lifestyle.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.080]   I think it's important, but I need the sanity check
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.440]   that it's actually viable.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   And the way I do that is to see
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.520]   if people will pay money for it.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.560]   So it's not a ranking thing.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.320]   It's a sanity check for an idea.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.880]   Is that idea sufficiently valuable
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.360]   that you can actually run with it?
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.800]   Now let's talk about Andrew Yang's book,
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.840]   "Smart People Should Build Things."
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   Yes, Yang is right.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.360]   I like that argument.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.440]   I think he's right in it.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.000]   And it's something that we should emphasize more.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.560]   I saw this upfront.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.740]   I went to an Ivy League school, okay?
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.680]   And I know these are stories,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.720]   just gonna get myself in trouble with people.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.600]   So let's hope no one I know is listening to this.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.960]   I'm gonna tell some, literally some stories out of school.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.280]   But so I went to an Ivy League college
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.960]   and I guess I was naive, right?
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.680]   Because I came out of public school,
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.400]   a handful of people went to Ivy League schools
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.280]   from the public school.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.760]   I was like, okay, you know, this should be good.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.880]   Whatever, I come in there all naive.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.680]   A lot of really smart, interesting people,
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.840]   as you'd imagine at one of these schools.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.600]   I just assumed that we were all gonna go off
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.720]   and do like really interesting things.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.880]   Like I was writing books
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.640]   and I was gonna go to grad school at MIT and write books
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.520]   and become a professor.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.880]   And my wife who I met there,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.280]   who was also from a public school
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.000]   and sort of similarly naive about this,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.480]   went into, she had studied,
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.960]   she went to like a educational nonprofits
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.840]   and there's something she had studied.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.200]   And we had another friend,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   so our third friend who was our third sort of like
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.640]   just stumbled into Ivy League school
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.360]   from some public school, went into journalism.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.760]   And I just felt like everyone was gonna do that.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.680]   Like you're gonna write books
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.880]   and become journalists and professors and thinkers.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.920]   And outside of that small group,
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.720]   everyone went to Harvard Law School.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.840]   And I remember being surprised by it.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.760]   I was like, you're all just going to Harvard Law School?
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.280]   Like you all just are, everyone's just becoming a lawyer
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.240]   and the ones who didn't went to finance or consulting.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.840]   But I remember so many of my friends
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.280]   went to Harvard Law School.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.560]   I was like, you don't,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.960]   do you guys really want to be lawyers?
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.720]   Like, I've never heard you talk about this.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.520]   Like, this isn't your,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.560]   like some thing that you're into.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.480]   And this is why I was naive,
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.400]   is that there's just a whole culture that like,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.680]   you grow up, if you grew up like upper middle class
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.200]   and go to a private school
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.240]   and your parents are like high paid professionals,
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.600]   it's like, this is the whole point.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.440]   You go to these prestigious schools
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.720]   so that you can get the elite specialized jobs
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.600]   at the lawyers, at the big firms or in finance
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.640]   or in consulting.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.000]   And I didn't know that, no one told me that part
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.560]   because I kind of just stumbled into this Ivy League school
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.480]   and was like, this means I get to write books
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.320]   and go to grad school.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.160]   And everyone else was like,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.360]   this means I get to go to Harvard Law School.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.720]   So this is why Andrew Yang's book resonated
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.200]   because I don't know how many,
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.840]   how many like high price specialized law partners we need.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   I don't know how many people we need
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.960]   using their intelligence to make financial instruments
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.000]   that are so complicated that no one can understand them
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.120]   so Goldman can make it unprecedented profit margin
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:04.960]   off of them.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.920]   I had a friend from school
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.480]   who went to work for a prop trading desk
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.960]   at one of these firms.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.440]   And he was assigned one CEO, like one company.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.600]   And like his whole job was to just learn everything possible
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.560]   about this guy, listen to every public statement he did,
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.360]   every investor call he did,
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.000]   and even learn the tone of his voice.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.920]   Like I think he's worried just so they could make
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.600]   like the best decision on trading this particular stock.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.880]   I don't know, this guy wrote for the humor magazine with me.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   Smart, funny, interesting guy.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.920]   Is that really what the society needed
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.840]   was making sure that the, you know,
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.400]   Goldman prop trading desk was gonna get a little bit
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.280]   of an edge on trading Radio Shack or whatever.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.880]   So I actually am one of these sort of, you know,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.080]   I don't know, hypocritical Ivy League populist
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.920]   on these types of things.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.760]   Is I think people should go do interesting things.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.560]   These smart people who go to these schools
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   and probably they do now, this was a while ago.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.400]   Don't go to Wall Street, don't go to law school.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.200]   You're not gonna like being a lawyer.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.720]   Let me just cut to the chase.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.760]   You're not gonna like it.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.040]   If you're good and go to a good law school,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.320]   they're gonna give you a job that's gonna be terrible.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.160]   You're gonna have to work so much and it's terrible.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.280]   And you're gonna have to go to a country club
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.600]   at some point, it's not good.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.720]   And let me tell you about Wall Street.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.120]   Like, yeah, you're gonna make a lot of money,
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   but like you're gonna be kind of a little bit
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.380]   douchey broey probably.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.120]   And they're gonna make you do spreadsheets
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.760]   until three in the morning and you're gonna be depressed.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.520]   Like I can just cut to the chase.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.960]   Like go do something interesting,
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.180]   write books, become an academic, start companies.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.880]   More people should start companies.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.600]   Do the Elon Musk thing.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.520]   He was like, I'm just gonna go invent cool things
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.560]   'cause it should exist.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.240]   It also makes life more interesting.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.720]   So yeah, I'm not the preacher to teach you,
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:50.160]   but I'm in the Andrew Yang school that you should,
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.700]   if you're smart and you go to one of these
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.800]   really good schools is go do interesting things,
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.320]   go build things or produce things that are useful.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.680]   I mean, I will say I think Georgetown
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.920]   where I am now is good about this.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.800]   We get more civic minded people.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.600]   We send a lot of people in the public service.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   They come here to go in the public service.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.640]   And so I think we get more of that to Jesuit ethos
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.960]   pervades the institution.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.000]   Like you're getting educated so you can improve the world.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.520]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.200]   But I think that memo needs to spread.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.440]   So I'm in favor of what Yang says,
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.840]   go build cool things, go write books,
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.400]   don't go to Harvard Law School.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.720]   Jesse, is this where I say, okay, now time to talk to,
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   let's go to our sponsors.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.360]   We have a new sponsor here, Harvard Law School.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.200]   Oh no.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.240]   Again, thwarted, thwarted.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.120]   Goldman, the Goldman Sachs proprietary trading desk.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.400]   Man, I gotta vet these things.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.240]   I gotta vet these things.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.000]   They're actually, speaking of sponsors though,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.080]   let's talk about a real one we have, which is stamps.com.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.760]   So let's say you do follow Andrew Yang's advice.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.200]   You do go start a business.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.520]   You're employing real people.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.920]   You're building interesting things.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   You're not just doing financial derivatives.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.280]   If you were doing that,
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.160]   and I think Jesse, you will appreciate this transition.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.480]   You don't wanna waste your time
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.400]   with repeated trips to the post office, right?
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.920]   I think that's chapter three of Andrew Yang's book.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.720]   So with stamps.com, you can skip that trip
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.840]   and focus on what it takes to bring your business
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.160]   to the next level.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.760]   As I talked about in Monday's episode,
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.920]   stamps.com allows you to print official postage
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.000]   right from your computer.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.280]   So you don't have to go to the post office to send it.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.560]   In addition to giving you access
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.040]   to the post office shipping services,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.680]   you also give access to UPS shipping services
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.120]   right there from your computer.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.200]   And they give you big discounts.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.680]   40% off the UPS rates, the postal service rates,
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.560]   76% off the UPS rates.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.440]   So whether you're an office and the invoices,
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.360]   a side hustle Etsy shop,
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.240]   or a full blown warehouse shipping out order,
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.200]   stamps.com will make your life easier.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.520]   You just need a computer and a printer.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.760]   So stop overpaying for shipping.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.720]   So you can put your attention
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.320]   to making the world a better place
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.240]   and showing those Harvard Law School lawyers who's boss
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.040]   by going to stamps.com.

[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.840]   and going to Goldman and Harvard Law School,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.000]   and now you're anxious because your life
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.400]   is devoid of useful meaning,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.120]   no matter, you're gonna get in trouble for this.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.120]   You need Headspace.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.360]   You need Headspace's guided meditation app
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.280]   to help you refine your center
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.440]   and calm down that anxious mind.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.480]   I am a Headspace fan.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.420]   I talked about on Monday that I was using Headspace
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.040]   during this recent busy period
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.600]   that just calmed down my sympathetic nervous system.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.280]   I was using their breathing related guided meditations.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.500]   They walk you through how to breathe and how to think,
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   very calm voice, and it was quite effective.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.920]   Headspace has meditations for many different types of uses,
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.120]   including focus, it's relevant for Deep Questions listeners,
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.280]   guided meditations to help you get ready to focus,
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.300]   guided meditations to help you sleep,
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.000]   guided meditations to help you breathe better
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.300]   or fight anxiety.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.360]   It's something I think we all could probably use
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.320]   a little bit of now.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.160]   Headspace is scientifically proven
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.480]   to help you manage your feelings and mental health.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.320]   Recent study proved that in just two weeks,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.560]   it reduces stress by 14%.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.200]   So this actually does work.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.160]   So however you're feeling,
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.600]   try Headspace at headspace.com/questions
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   and get one month free of their entire Mindfulness Library.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.680]   This is the best Headspace offer available,
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.760]   but you have to go to headspace.com/questions today.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.320]   That's headspace.com/questions.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.680]   All right, speaking of questions, Jesse,
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.080]   I think we've got time to fit in one or two more.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.280]   So who do we have next?
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.440]   - All right, next question is a 35 year old
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.320]   looking to change careers and potentially abandon
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.760]   some of the career capital that he's accumulated.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:22.600]   - Hey, Kyle, hope you're doing great.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.800]   My name is Sebastian.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.120]   I am a 35 year old man from Uruguay.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.960]   And my question was regarding switching careers
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.900]   as a 35 year old.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:39.080]   I work as a location sound recordist for film
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.120]   and I was thinking of changing careers because of money.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:51.640]   I didn't know what the job offerings would be like
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:58.240]   in my field when I first started.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.320]   So as I got deeper into the field,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   I realized that there's a lot that I don't control.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.280]   And you end up being a freelancer
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.200]   and you don't know where you're going to be offered a job.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.800]   And all you can do is network
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.240]   and well, that's all the control you have.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.400]   So I'm trying to switch over to web development
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.880]   and start from scratch.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.480]   I think, well, I can use the wisdom of
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.900]   I have accumulated over time to make the best of it.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.760]   But I was wondering about your thoughts
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.360]   about switching careers and abandoning
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.920]   all this career capital I have accumulated.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.440]   So thank you and goodbye.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.860]   - Well, Sebastian, I'm always a little bit nervous
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.200]   about starting from scratch with career capital
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.560]   because it's an ironclad law of the market
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.520]   is that skills acquired quickly
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.400]   produce modest amounts of income at most.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.520]   So if there was just some web development course
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.760]   you could take for a few months
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.280]   and then be making a really good steady living,
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.860]   lots of people would take that course
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.280]   and it would price the market down again.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.160]   So there's this supply and demand tension
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.160]   in most marketplaces, which means you have to have
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.960]   a pretty hard one skill
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.080]   if you want a nice sustainable income from it.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.120]   It's not always true, but it typically is true.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.680]   So I would be wary about just saying
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.640]   enough of the sound stuff.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   I'm now gonna go become a web developer.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.440]   Now this doesn't mean you can't start picking up
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.000]   that new skill, but I would do it on the side
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.400]   as I am trying to build a larger
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.680]   and more stable business in sound.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.160]   I would see if it's possible to build
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.440]   on your existing career capital
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.000]   to perhaps get out of this mode of just,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.080]   I'm a freelancer that does just this type of thing
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.440]   and hope people pick me and to build out a business
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.360]   that's a little bit more aggressive,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.640]   a business that maybe is a little bit more niche,
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.400]   a business that has a good clear presence,
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.320]   a business that you are somewhat aggressively marketing.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.640]   This is what I would do at the same time.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.520]   And so I don't know your field very well,
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.080]   but you know sound very well.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.280]   You're doing location sound for films,
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.420]   but like for example,
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:21.320]   you could probably be a podcast sound engineer as well,
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.860]   which is something you can do remotely
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.320]   for people all over the world.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.560]   This is what I do.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.800]   You send me your files.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.560]   I master them, get them ready.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.960]   I edit them, whatever.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.000]   That could be really useful.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.400]   You could be an in-person engineer
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.660]   to set up studios for people like podcast studios,
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.560]   like Joe is doing for us here or what have you.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.680]   But in other words, like finding niches
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   that you could build into quickly
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.640]   'cause you know about sound and sound equipment,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.760]   building out clear businesses around it,
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.000]   being aggressive in your marketing
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.560]   and very good in your execution.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.320]   You get back to people, you have processes.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.340]   I mean, I would be doing that as a foundational piece
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.000]   to try to get that income more stable,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.720]   to control your life a little bit more
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.400]   than just being a freelancer.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.280]   And then if you wanna pick up a skill on the side,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.880]   do it at the same time concurrently
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.560]   and pull the Derek Sivers thing here
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.200]   that we talked about earlier in the episode.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.680]   Don't switch over to web development
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.760]   until you're making the money already.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.960]   I'm doing this on the side
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.280]   and I'm making a living off of it.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.680]   Okay, if I really wanna do that instead,
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.160]   now I'm happy to make that switch.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.000]   And if I'm not,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.680]   I know I shouldn't be making that switch yet.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.320]   And then the final thing I would advise is combine.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.160]   If you're gonna build up a new skill,
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.960]   find ways to bring that skill
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.120]   into the orbit of skills you already have
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.720]   to find a new hybrid combination.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.160]   Because then you are using the fact
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.480]   that you have a preexisting skill
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.360]   to raise that barrier to entry.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.160]   So if you're doing web,
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.040]   maybe what you master is how to do web-based apps
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.640]   or projects for people in the sound space.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.240]   Something that requires your existing network
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.800]   and connections to the sound space,
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.080]   your existing expertise.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.400]   So not just anyone who does a web development course
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.320]   can come in and compete for your same business.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.760]   All right, so get more focused and ambitious
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.800]   about your work right now with your current capital.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.680]   Two, if you're gonna build up a secondary skill,
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.880]   do it on the side.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.920]   Definitely don't switch to that
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.080]   until you have evidence that it's making a lot,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.680]   enough money for you for that switch to be safe.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.440]   And three, try to combine the new skill
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.960]   with your existing skills to get a unique hybrid
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.520]   that very few people have.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.200]   That's often the best route to something
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.560]   that is very sustainable and lucrative
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.200]   and relatively non-competitive.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.880]   All right, I think we have time for one more, Jesse.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.560]   Do we have one more?
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.400]   - Yep, we go.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.040]   Another question here, it's about reading,
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.040]   which is a popular topic among your listeners.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.320]   And she's reading quickly,
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.080]   but she also wants to be able to read deeply.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.040]   - Not a fan of reading, not a fan.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.400]   - You have your March books coming to an end.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.040]   - My, wait, what's coming to an end?
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.880]   - March books.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.720]   - Oh, March books.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.960]   Oh yeah, I finished the March books.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.800]   - Oh, you're already, even with the busy time,
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.640]   like you've pressed read.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.480]   - I finished, okay.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.440]   I finished the five books in March, around mid-March,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.760]   but I'm a little off the month boundary.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.400]   So like the, I was almost done with the book
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.520]   before March began.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.040]   So like I got a freebie pretty quickly.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.080]   But anyway, so I finished early
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.640]   because the Thomas Merton book's a beast.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.080]   Because that 450 page book,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.800]   I think in like standard modern print
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.720]   would be more like a 550, 600 page book.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.440]   So I'm throwing, and I'm busy.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.440]   So I'm throwing two weeks at it in the second half of March.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.560]   So I can finish that beast in April with time.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.880]   I'm reading another book simultaneously,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.560]   but so I have time in April to get the other four.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.240]   So I'm reading that and another one simultaneously
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.040]   with the hopes that pretty early in the April,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.680]   I can bring those to a close
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.660]   and then be off the ground running
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.280]   with only three books to go.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.120]   So.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:43.940]   - Nice.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.360]   - But still, my answer to this question
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.160]   is I'm not a fan of reading.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.920]   That's time you could be TikToking.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.320]   You could be refining your TikToks.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.920]   You could be quitting your job
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.960]   to make a full-time living on TikTok.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.240]   Just trust that that's gonna work.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.280]   So it's not a good idea in general.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.240]   It could strain your eyes.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.080]   If you strain your eyes,
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.100]   how are you gonna be able to see TikToks?
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:09.000]   Oh my, all right, we should get to the question.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:09.840]   Here we go.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.660]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.500]   My name is Renee and I'm calling in from Melbourne, Australia.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.880]   I have a three week vacation
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.720]   before starting my job as a junior lawyer.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.560]   I'm investing this time into my hobby,
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.040]   which is reading books.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:22.880]   And I just picked up
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.380]   the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy for the first time.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.520]   I read books quickly and widely,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.720]   but often not very deeply.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.800]   So I get the gist of the book
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.960]   or the author's main argument,
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.440]   but do not always appreciate
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.660]   their particular intricacies or nuances.
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.360]   Do you find it hard to read deeply
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.600]   when you're also reading quickly?
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.340]   I know you aim for five books a month.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.120]   Could you please provide some tips on how to do both
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.680]   for various benefits like memory retention,
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.280]   synthesis, and the generation of new unique ideas?
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   Thanks very much.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:01.480]   - Well, Renee, you can't do deep and quick at the same time.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.280]   So I think that's true.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.780]   But what I would say is,
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.400]   and this is how I do the five books a month,
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.800]   different books require different levels of depth.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.320]   And so some books are gonna be much faster to read
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.080]   than others, which is why I do a pretty careful balance.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.360]   So like right now, we just talked about it
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.200]   in the last question,
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.560]   I'm reading Thomas Merton's "Seven Story Mountain."
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.420]   It's a beast of a book in terms of length,
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.080]   but it's not a book that requires really slow reading
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.320]   because it's not conceptual, it's memoir.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.200]   He's a very good writer
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.320]   and you could just get lost into his world
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.480]   and he can move very fast through that.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.040]   On the other hand, if you read a book that's more,
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.560]   it's given an argument,
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.840]   even like an intellectual argument,
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.560]   that might take longer.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.840]   And I'll slow down with a book like that.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.280]   Or what's often happens is
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.640]   if I'm reading a modern nonfiction idea book,
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.400]   I'm putting the accelerator off and on.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.680]   So there'll be a section where I'm like,
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.760]   I don't really care, I get your gist,
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.600]   I don't care about this and I go fast.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.920]   Then I'm like, ooh, now you're treading water
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.400]   that is interesting to me.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.840]   There's real depth underneath your legs here.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.640]   And then I'm gonna slow way down
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.560]   and try to get that just right.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.600]   Then speed back up again
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.220]   when it gets back to something really interesting.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.280]   So again, some books require depth,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.480]   some passages of books require depth, others don't.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.960]   And so I'll mix all them together
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.880]   to give my mind a variety of different things.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.220]   So the fastest books,
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.380]   the fastest books are either fun novels
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:30.120]   or lightweight idea books,
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.560]   sort of nonfiction books that you might buy in the airport.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.960]   I like reading those occasionally.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.480]   And you can read those fast, just shoot through.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:38.320]   On the other end of the spectrum,
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.520]   I think it's like academic books
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.360]   where someone's really making an argument.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.960]   And I'm more careful about how often I read those
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.800]   'cause I know they're gonna take time.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.040]   And then in between you have like really well-written
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:51.680]   literary novels, well-written memoir,
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.240]   nonfiction that has some good ideas and some filler.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.400]   And so you go the speed that the book demands.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.200]   But in the end, what you really care about
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.700]   is not so much the count, not so much the pages,
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:02.720]   not so much the number of books.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.200]   I mean, we like to joke around about the five books.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.100]   And I think it's nice to have that particular number.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:10.440]   But what really matters is the experience itself,
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.040]   that you're giving the book in front of you
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.440]   the attention the book in front of you actually demands.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.360]   So some take more, some take less.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.320]   If you're reading one of my books,
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.440]   I would recommend six months
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.720]   because what you wanna do is savor,
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.560]   savor the language like a fine wine,
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.840]   the carefully crafted sentences,
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.880]   go show them to people,
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.680]   tell people about sentences you liked.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.420]   I mean, so my books, I would say six months,
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.260]   six months per book.
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:38.680]   I'm talking six months of a sabbatical.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.760]   So you're giving this full time,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.960]   six months full time attention.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.640]   But for other books, you could probably go,
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.280]   you could probably go a little bit quicker.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.920]   All right, so speaking about going quick,
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.000]   Jesse, we're at the hour mark.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.980]   So we should probably wrap this up.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:53.880]   Thank you everyone who sent in your questions.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.280]   I should probably remind people how to do that.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.960]   It's go to calnewport.com/podcast for the instructions.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.520]   That'll tell you how to do the voice questions.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.460]   That'll tell you how to do the written questions.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.680]   We're pretty international today, Jesse.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.520]   I don't know if this is the voice messages in general,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.540]   10 more international,
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.560]   or I just don't realize that the written questions
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.160]   are international, but this was a pretty,
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.600]   like a United Nations of deep life advice today.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.060]   - Yeah, the audience is from all over.
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.600]   - Yeah, that's always good to see.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.800]   It's always good to see.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.360]   So anyways, thanks for sending those questions,
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.340]   calnewport.com/podcast to find out
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:29.600]   how to submit on your own.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.000]   If you like what you heard, you will like what you see.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.120]   YouTube.com/calnewportmedia for YouTube videos
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.580]   of full episodes that every individual question
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.240]   that I do has its own clip.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.040]   You'll also like what you read at my newsletter,
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:47.040]   calnewport.com to subscribe to my usually weekly newsletter,
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.200]   though I've been a little bit tardy during this busy period.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.360]   We'll be back Monday.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.660]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.940]   (upbeat music)
