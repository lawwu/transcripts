[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   If you try to rouse your planet to give it any sense that it is in peril, there are the idiot
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.760]   disaster monkeys who are like, "Ooh, ooh, this sounds like if this is dangerous, it must be
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.520]   powerful, right? I'm going to be first to grab the poison banana." And what is one supposed to do?
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.120]   Should one remain silent? Should one let everyone walk directly into the whirling razor blades?
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   If you sent me back in time, I'm not sure I could win this, but maybe I would have some notion of,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.920]   "Ah, if you calculate the message in exactly this way, then this group will not take away
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.040]   this message and you will be able to get this group of people to research on it without having
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.480]   this other group of people decide that it's excitingly dangerous and they want to rush
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:01:03.840]   forward on it." I'm not that smart. I'm not that wise.
