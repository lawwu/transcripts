[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.240]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.160]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today I want to talk about Bitcoin.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.440]   This past week I have just been in Miami attending the Bitcoin 2022 conference, perhaps the largest
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.520]   Bitcoin conference in the world at the moment.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.040]   And it was indeed quite large, to give you a context of scale.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   The organizers of the conference said that they had 25,000 attendees.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.640]   What I found most impressive was simply visiting the exhibit hall.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.960]   And I've been to a lot of conferences over the years.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.040]   I find conferences a very efficient way to come up to speed quickly on a topic.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.520]   And so I'll routinely attend a conference that I'm trying to get a lay of the land.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.800]   And what I find useful is certainly the speakers, yes, listening to the talks and getting an
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.760]   idea of the ideas that are presented at a conference I find very useful.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.360]   Also the people, yes, some of the people you meet at a conference are often leaders in
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.640]   an industry and it can be a great chance to meet some of the creme de la creme of an organization.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.360]   But I find the exhibit halls often quite useful.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.920]   And especially more when I was younger, I would go to an exhibit hall and I would routinely
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.720]   just simply visit every booth.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.300]   Here are people who have paid money to get their message in front of you.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.960]   And if you simply go from booth to booth and ask them about their product, about their
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.560]   service, you can quickly grasp an overview of an industry based upon hearing what people
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.500]   are presenting and then asking them about their competitors and letting them educate
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.520]   you on their particular business.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.740]   Well most of the time you need a few hours to cover an expo hall.
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.740]   There are some exceptions.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.460]   You might have a huge consumer electronics show or something like that where it's huge.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.720]   But in this case I found the expo hall so big I didn't even get through a third of it
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   myself.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.400]   It was huge in terms of the number of exhibitors.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.000]   And that's one of the things that I'll talk about today because I was extraordinarily
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.520]   impressed with how entrepreneurs have been systematically solving the various problems
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.160]   that exist with Bitcoin.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   And that really has increased my confidence in the offering.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.920]   So let's talk first about Bitcoin and I'll tell you what my takeaways were from the conference.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.560]   Long time listeners of Radical Personal Finance know that I was not early on the Bitcoin bandwagon.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   And I regret that.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.880]   I should have been early.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.100]   And there's a whole episode of Radical Personal Finance wherein I apologize to you for not
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.000]   advising you to buy Bitcoin and I explain some of the reasons why I think I was not
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.280]   early.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.920]   And while that has continued to bother me that I wasn't an early adopter of Bitcoin,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.520]   what's done is done and all I can do is press forward and try to get an idea of what to
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.100]   do today.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.680]   And so as I've looked at Bitcoin and studied it and tried to think about its integration
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.420]   in the modern life, I have been personally most interested in the ideological aspects
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420]   of Bitcoin.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.000]   Big surprise, I know, that Joshua Sheets would be interested in the ideology of something.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.760]   But hey, that's the truth.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.680]   There's some people get involved in Bitcoin just because they want to make a quick buck
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.320]   hopefully or they want to trade it or something like that.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.800]   But I care about the ideology because I care about freedom.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.320]   I care about personal sovereignty.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.680]   I care about liberty on a global basis.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I see that freedom in the monetary system is one of the foundations of really excellent
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.800]   global freedom.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.600]   And I think that there should be a system where people can freely compete with one another
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.800]   and where currencies can compete with one another in the free market.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.320]   That's my belief.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.560]   I think that competition is one of the most ethical systems.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.480]   Excellent non-coercive competition is one of the most ethical systems that's out there
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.320]   for allowing good ideas to bubble up to the surface and allowing for us to advance forward
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.760]   as a human race, continuing to live in an increasingly prosperous and increasingly free
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.500]   and increasingly righteous society.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.720]   And so at every level, I want to be one who supports freedom.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.320]   And monetary freedom is an important component of that.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.120]   I think for me, what started me on that bandwagon was when I was in college, I read, I think
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.800]   it was Perkins, right, who wrote the book, The Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   And it just opened my eyes to the evil done by my own native country, the United States
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.600]   of America, and how the United States of America has manipulated the world in a really horrific
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.120]   coercive faction just using the monetary supply, not to say nothing of the actual involvement
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.200]   in war and violence, which of course is abundant, but simply using the monetary supply, using
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.160]   loans, using systems of economic coercion and control.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.480]   And I consider it to be really, really awful and something that should change.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.920]   The challenge has been that there often hasn't been a great alternative.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.360]   People have wanted alternatives for quite a while.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.480]   If you look around the world and you study history, you see that a fundamental component
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.280]   of history is monetary crises, monetary failures.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.640]   And many nations, those monetary failures are quite obvious, whether it's right now
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.880]   the Russian ruble, right now the Venezuelan bolivar, and over the last decade, the Venezuelan
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   monetary system.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.400]   Or you could go back and you could see the Zimbabwe hyperinflation.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.880]   You could go to the hyperinflation in Mexico in the 1980s.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.120]   You could look at the, what, three crises, two, two, three, four crises in Argentina
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.680]   over the last decades.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.800]   And you could see how these monetary crises again and again and again affect the history.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.320]   And some of the countries that we're from, they're harder to see, right?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.480]   In the United States, we've had four or five significant monetary crises, totally
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.760]   new currencies or just simply adjustments of the currencies.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.840]   But these weren't as big of a deal in our nation, in the United States, as they were
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.800]   in some other places, while they're still a big deal.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.560]   And so you look at history and you realize that throughout history, monetary crisis has
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.440]   been a major component of what has happened in a country.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.920]   And that monetary crisis has often led to good things, bad things.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   It's a mixed bag, right?
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.880]   As history always is.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.960]   And so you look for an alternative.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   And when I was younger, I was convinced that there should be competition in the realm of
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.840]   currencies, that there should be free and easy competition, that you should be able
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.120]   to use any currency that you want to and currencies should compete with one another.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.800]   There's no reason why the government, which has a monopoly on violence, should also have
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.320]   a monopoly on money creation.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.160]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.720]   And those two things, when they go together, lead to very bad results.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.240]   And so why not have competition?
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.960]   When you look at it and you realize the trend in the United States, the growth of government,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.440]   you realize that politicians control the money supply and politicians control tax dollars,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.240]   leads to massive levels of control over society.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.000]   And a lot of really dumb things are being done.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.480]   Sometimes they're just dumb.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   Sometimes they're evil.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.060]   I guess, to be fair, maybe sometimes they're good.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.960]   But a lot of dumb things are done over time because politicians can create the money.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.560]   And we're heading towards a significant crisis in the United States and in most countries
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.880]   of the world that have built a welfare state.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.000]   The welfare state in the United States is completely underfunded.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.360]   It's bankrupt now.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.840]   It's just going to take time for that bankruptcy to express itself to where it's obvious to
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   people.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.080]   I've done several shows on that.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.760]   If you haven't listened to those, go back in the annals of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.040]   search for the ticking time bomb that no one wants to discuss, which is a deep dive analysis
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.520]   that I did on the financial system in the United States and the welfare state.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.000]   And I showed how, and this was prior to the pandemic, I showed how unless massive changes
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.040]   happened very quickly, it was impossible that there would be any change whatsoever.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.760]   And then just as was predicted, no massive changes happened of any kind except in the
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.880]   worst direction, where borrowed even more money, building even more government programs,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.880]   etc.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.520]   And so this is bankruptcy of the United States government.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:27.680]   Bankruptcy of the welfare systems is inevitable, as I see it, in coming in the future.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.320]   And the monetary system is going to be a component of that.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.920]   So I've been interested in free market alternatives.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.960]   And I've looked for free market alternatives.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.320]   When you want to get out of the Federal Reserve Note system or you want to get out of the
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.440]   fractional banking system, you have a number of alternatives.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.240]   One alternative, of course, is to go into international banking and to simply choose
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.760]   different countries in which to bank.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.720]   And I've been a strong and loud proponent of that because I believe it solves many of
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.640]   the problems that people are concerned with.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.200]   The reasons why they want alternatives can usually be most easily solved by simply accessing
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.920]   the international banking system.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.080]   In one sense, I think that accessing the international banking system is simply a validation of the
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   concept of competition over currency competition, banking competition, etc.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.880]   Countries are in competition with one another.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.520]   And you can choose to go to the countries that treat you best and give you the best
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.940]   options and simply choose to bank there.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.120]   For many people around the world, that means going to the United States and banking in
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.360]   the United States.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.880]   Many wonderful benefits for that.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   For some U.S. Americans, it means going to other places and banking in other places.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.640]   The challenge is that most of the leading banking jurisdictions of the world run on
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.000]   the same basic principle of fractional reserve banking, fiat monetary standards, as does
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.160]   the United States.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.960]   And so while there are many good reasons to participate in those countries' banking systems,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:03.680]   if you're trying to create something fundamentally new, that hasn't worked as well as many people
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.120]   of hope, because there's very rarely been a country around the world that has said,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.280]   "We're on a gold standard," for example.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.480]   Some countries have hinted at it even recently.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   Countries have made announcements of it.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.640]   Countries will do that.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.840]   But in general, you know that a gold standard in and of itself is just a statement that
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.400]   a country makes, and the country can revoke that really at any time, just like the United
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.760]   States did.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.960]   And so it's a convenient thing to bring clients and customers to your country for a time if
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.520]   people are looking for a gold standard, and then it's convenient to revoke that in time.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.680]   So you say, "What can be another solution?"
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.800]   Well, maybe I could exit the fractional banking system entirely.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.240]   I remember years ago I first came across the concept of some people who were trying to
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.560]   start an old-fashioned silver bank, and I thought, "That's really interesting.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.800]   You could bank in silver."
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.040]   The way it would work is they basically created a repository.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.260]   You would make contributions to that bank in the form of fiat money.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.160]   They would purchase silver, and your account was measured in ounces of silver that you
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.240]   owned, and then you would simply pay a custodianship fee to the bank for managing the silver.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.840]   In some cases, they would give you a debit card, and you would actually be able to spend
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.960]   your silver on your debit card.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.000]   And I thought, "That's a great idea."
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.440]   The problem is it's an old technology that doesn't really work so well in the modern
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.400]   age because so much of what we do is digital, and while you can appreciate the fact that
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.700]   I might have silver deposits held at this old bank, and that's great, you look around
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.760]   and you say, "Is this really what's necessary?
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.360]   And is silver really the right solution?
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   This seems really unwieldy.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.880]   Wouldn't it be great to have a digital solution to this?"
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.960]   And since the dawn of the Internet, when people realized the power of the Internet, having
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:52.600]   some form of reliable digital money or digital gold has been a basic component of what people
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.880]   have wanted to make the Internet work more effectively.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.920]   There have been many efforts made.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.480]   eGold, digital gold has been promoted by various people.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.560]   But Bitcoin has broken through in a powerful way all of the other competitive ideas with
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.600]   some really ingenious thinking, a really ingenious way of developing a new system.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.440]   And so the question has been, "Well, is it real?
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   Can it work?
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   Will it work?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   What's the future?"
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   I think most thoughtful observers have recognized that there could be a wide range of outcomes.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.440]   And many people would say you could go either to zero or it can go to the moon.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.080]   There's a wide range of potential outcomes available in Bitcoin.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.120]   Since we don't know the future, we don't know which outcome will happen.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.920]   It's not certain.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.200]   We all have our guesses.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.960]   We all have our opinions, but we don't know which outcome will happen.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:58.560]   I think that now the outcomes are starting to narrow, meaning that I don't think myself
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.960]   that there's much case at all that Bitcoin will go to zero, for example, and be totally
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.200]   worthless.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.160]   We see – in fact, this is one of the reasons why I wanted to go to the Bitcoin conference
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.940]   because since the initial success of Bitcoin, we've seen thousands and thousands of new
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.440]   cryptocurrencies created, many of them saying that we're going to compete with Bitcoin.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.320]   We've seen some wacky stuff happen where people have said, "Hey, this thing doesn't
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   exist anyway.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   It's just a meme.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   It's just a joke.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.200]   It's just a mathematical formula.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.880]   So let's go ahead and create new jokes."
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.640]   And then those jokes become popular, a la Dogecoin, etc.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.560]   And people look at it and say, "Well, what's the future?
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.600]   What does the future hold?"
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.160]   And I think that even over the last year, there's been some significant stress testing
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:49.560]   of Bitcoin specifically being banned multiple times by many countries, right?
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.120]   China banned it multiple times.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.280]   You see the Canadian government trying to ban Bitcoin transactions coming hard after
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.840]   Bitcoin custodians with the trucker convoy protest.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.520]   Right now, I think the use of Bitcoin in Russia and in and out of Russia is a really interesting
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.080]   stress test to watch.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.400]   New legislation in the European Union over cold wallets, even just this last week, is
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.120]   really important to watch.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.680]   And so we're seeing a stress testing happen significantly, but we're seeing Bitcoin work
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   in many, many ways.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.400]   And so as the years go forward and as more and more of these stress tests happen and
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.320]   as there's more and more development, we see that Bitcoin is showing itself increasingly
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   resilient.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.480]   I want to talk for a moment about some metaphors that I use.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.080]   I'm going to give you my takeaways from the conference and why going to the conference
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.520]   impressed me so much.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:50.880]   I believe that it's possible to have, in many cases, a superior solution to a problem that
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.560]   simply doesn't take on, that doesn't work because there's not widespread adoption.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.840]   And this is one of the problems that faces Bitcoin, which I think it's overcoming, but
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.480]   it's one of the problems that it faces Bitcoin.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:11.760]   A currency is valuable to the extent that it is universally desired and acceptable.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.920]   When you think about what money is and you try to clarify and define what money is, my
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.460]   favorite definition is simply that money is the most marketable commodity in existence.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.640]   It's the thing that everybody wants.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.760]   That's what money is.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.680]   You could have various forms of money.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.000]   You can have conch shells used as money.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.680]   You can have beads used as money.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.120]   You can have gold and silver coins used as money.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:45.420]   You could have US dollars or euros or Canadian dollars or Deutschmarks or francs or any number
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.040]   of things used as money.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.120]   You can have money that's used in certain places.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.520]   I thought it was fascinating watching the various video game forms of money that were
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.440]   used as currency and traded in Venezuela over the last year because people were looking
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.440]   for something.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.480]   They said, "Hey, I can trade this digital currency, this currency that exists only inside
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.680]   this certain game."
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.760]   It's no different than trading credits for iTunes or Warcraft credits or all the stuff
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.480]   that's needed in the digital world.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.960]   Money can really be anything, but in order for it to be money, it needs to be desired
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.920]   and accepted by people as being universally valuable.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.680]   That's why a US dollar can be so useful.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.320]   You can go almost anywhere in the world and people know the value of the US dollar because
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.760]   it's so large.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.240]   That same currency that is valuable in one country may not be valuable in another country.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.680]   If I brought to you a Colombian peso and you're living in Canada, it's going to be more difficult
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.000]   for me to convince you to accept that Colombian peso than it is a US dollar.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.640]   It's going to be far easier if I just simply have a Canadian dollar.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.980]   Money is useful and valuable to the extent that it's desired and that it is usable by
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.980]   many people.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.480]   Do people want it?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.840]   Now, just because something is technically superior or better doesn't necessarily mean
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.600]   that people will want it.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.720]   As I was at the conference, I was thinking of examples of this and I thought maybe a
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.760]   good example to consider this is a language example.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   I do think there are some good parallels between languages as we understand them today and
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.160]   currencies as we understand them today and what will happen in the coming years.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.720]   Here's a question for you to consider.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.800]   What is the most important language for you to speak and for you to teach your children
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.300]   today?
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.880]   The answer is obviously English.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.780]   English is the most widely spoken in the world, not by native speakers of course, but as a
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.100]   second language.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.900]   It is the international lingua franca, the international language of exchange, the language
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:18:03.060]   that is used by virtually all educated international people if they don't as their common language.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:08.580]   Even in countries that don't use English as a language, as an official language, you'll
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.140]   have people use English as their lingua franca even if it's not an official language.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.780]   Here I'm thinking of a place like Switzerland, right, where there are four official languages,
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.580]   German, French, Italian, and Romance.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:29.300]   And yet if a German-speaking Swiss goes to a French-speaking region of Switzerland, there's
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:35.060]   a good chance that they'll use English to interact with one another because the German-speaking
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.940]   Swiss and the French-speaking Swiss are taught English in school and that will be a comfortable
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.860]   lingua franca that perhaps doesn't have the baggage of their German and Swiss arguments
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.900]   and culture, etc.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.380]   The same thing happens all over the world.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.740]   If a Japanese businessman goes to Hong Kong to meet with a German businessman, they're
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:01.040]   going to be doing business in English even though one is from Japan, one is from Germany,
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.260]   and they're meeting in Hong Kong.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.740]   They're going to be doing business in English.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:14.140]   And so all thoughtful, educated, thinking elites around the world make sure that their
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   children speak English well.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.660]   They educate their children in English, they hire tutors, they make sure that they teach
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.700]   their children English because that is the language of the future.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.100]   Now, of course, there can be local lingua francas as there always has been throughout
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.460]   history but today English is the dominant player.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:38.060]   But English is not the world's best language by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.620]   English may not be as bad as many people allege it to be.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:47.100]   English can be pretty easy to learn in many contexts, but English has its own intricacies,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.860]   its difficulties, its things that make it hard to figure out and hard for people to
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.860]   learn.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.860]   And so over the years people have invented other languages, languages that are designed
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.220]   to be easy to learn and easy to use.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.820]   My favorite of these, or at least the one I know the most about, is a language called
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.820]   Esperanto.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:15.380]   Esperanto is a brand new language that was developed and it was designed to be easy.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:21.780]   It had no native speakers, it was a completely made up language, made up in the late 19th
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:29.100]   century, and it was invented to be a universal second language for international communication.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:36.460]   It was supposed to be similar to many natural languages, they call it naturalistic.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:44.620]   And it pulls a lot from European languages, but its grammar is created to be very easy
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.820]   to learn, very simple, very consistent, etc.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:52.900]   And today Esperanto has a wide group of users.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:58.380]   Estimates are that today there's something like 100,000 people that speak Esperanto.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:05.540]   All of these 100,000 people have been attracted to the concept of a superior language and
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.740]   they've learned Esperanto and they get together with other people around the world and they
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.180]   speak Esperanto with those other people.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:17.740]   And yet here we are, more than a century after the language was invented, and you have virtually
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:23.040]   no one who speaks or uses the language, and you have virtually no practical application
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.580]   of this language.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:30.820]   100,000 people, when compared to a global population, is a laughably small number of
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.820]   people.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.780]   And Esperanto enthusiasts are quite often quite passionate.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.460]   They're quite passionate about their subject, it's great.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.820]   And yet, point remains that I personally have virtually no interest in learning Esperanto.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:51.120]   I would rather spend my time learning a language that is spoken more broadly in a natural setting
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.540]   because I think it's more useful than speaking this artificially constructed but superior
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.020]   language called Esperanto.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:04.860]   And so when I think about that, I see a lot of parallels between Esperanto and Bitcoin.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.080]   Let's pretend for a moment that Bitcoin is a superior solution.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:16.580]   Let's pretend that the basic concept of Bitcoin is a better solution.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.680]   And I would say in some ways, I'll use the word undeniably, it's a strong word, but in
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.160]   some ways it undeniably is, at least from my perspective.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:32.580]   Words like Esperanto is, in some ways, undeniably better than English, or better than Spanish,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.980]   or better than Chinese.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.740]   It's just undeniably better.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.040]   It's created to be better.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.900]   But that doesn't, just because something is created to be better, doesn't mean that it's
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:47.540]   going to gain widespread use, that it's going to gain widespread adoption.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:54.300]   And even if I came to you and I said, you're in Canada, and I said, "Look, my Swiss franc
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.380]   is undeniably better than your Canadian dollar," you would look at it and say, "But I want
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.500]   the Canadian dollar because that's what's used around me."
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.100]   Just like if I came to you and I said, "You should educate your children in Esperanto
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.500]   because it's undeniably better than English," you would say, "Yeah, Joshua, we're going
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.980]   to teach our children English because that's the language that is used."
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:22.040]   And so I see the same challenge facing Bitcoin or any other competing currency, is that you
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.520]   have to gain adoption.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.020]   And in order for something to function as money, it has to be widely adopted.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.920]   It has to be picked up and it has to be wanted by other people.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.380]   So in order for that to work, I think you have to say there has to be various problems
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.140]   that are met.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:47.380]   And when I came away from the Bitcoin conference thinking, was that I am now profoundly convinced
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:57.060]   that Bitcoin does have a future and it can have a very, very strong future.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.640]   It can have a very, very strong future.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.260]   And it can have a very, very strong future as something, as a global currency, maybe
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:11.600]   a global reserve currency, maybe just a global currency, maybe just a useful thing.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.120]   I'm not convinced that it's going to sweep away everything else that would violate my
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.620]   fundamental belief in the concept of competition.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:28.240]   But I think it would, based upon this example I've given you with Esperanto, learning Esperanto
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.360]   could indeed have tremendous benefit.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.680]   But English is still the king for now.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.720]   And if you learned English and Esperanto, there would still be value in other local
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   languages.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.040]   I'm not sure that there will be one international standard in the future.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.440]   We had an interesting conversation with a couple of listeners on Twitter about that.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.680]   And I'm thinking more about that.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.280]   Maybe I'll come to change my mind.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:59.900]   But for today, I am confident in saying that Bitcoin can have a future as a strong global
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:08.400]   currency, a strong global storehouse of value, and that is also useful as a medium of exchange.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.560]   So let me give you some reasons why.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:17.240]   Number one, Bitcoin is already working as a storehouse of value.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.040]   It is already working as a storehouse of value.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.160]   Now that statement I think can be hard to accept for many people, given the significant
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.120]   daily, weekly, monthly fluctuations of Bitcoin.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:42.360]   As I record this, it looks like the Bitcoin to US dollar ratio is 40,703 US dollars fiat
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.080]   to each and every Bitcoin.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.120]   And you see that there are significant fluctuations up and down.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.480]   This used to bother me a lot more than it does today.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.340]   And in fact, if you would go back and find earlier recordings of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.440]   you would hear me make statements like, "These fluctuations have to smooth out in order for
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.120]   Bitcoin to gain more widespread acceptance."
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:12.440]   I have since come to see it differently, that perhaps these fluctuations have been what
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:19.920]   is necessary for Bitcoin to actually bridge the divide, to actually gain interest.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.840]   I used to say and criticize Bitcoin and say that the only reason people are getting into
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.080]   Bitcoin is because they want Bitcoin to go up.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.840]   They want Bitcoin to go to the moon.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.960]   They want 100,000 US dollar Bitcoin.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.440]   They want million dollar US dollar Bitcoin.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:41.080]   But what I see happening is I see a lot of people gaining exposure to Bitcoin because
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.360]   they want it to go up.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.760]   That doesn't necessarily mean that's a bad thing.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.640]   And so here would be an example.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.560]   Back to the language question.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.720]   If I look at my children, let's say that I grow up in Mexico, and I look at my children
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.120]   and I say, "It's obvious that in order to be successful on an international basis and
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:05.160]   to be leaders in a company or to be leaders in an industry or in an art or something like
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.080]   that, my children need to speak excellent English."
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:14.880]   The fact that I make sure that my children learn English for economic reasons, that's
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.760]   not a less...
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.600]   Some people would say, "Well, I want my children to learn English so they can enjoy the arts,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.360]   so they can learn and gain from this vast treasure trove of beautiful English language
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   literature."
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.840]   That's a valid reason to learn English.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.440]   It's also a valid reason to learn English because I want my children to get good international
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.000]   jobs and get rich.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.720]   Both of those are valid reasons to learn English.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.400]   The reason doesn't matter.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.840]   What matters is the result.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.680]   The result is that they learn English.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:53.720]   And so one person who learns English because they want access to the beautiful treasure
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:00.760]   trove of amazing English literature, that person may also wind up having a career that's
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.600]   advanced and earning more money because of the knowledge of English language.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.480]   And the other person who just learns English in order to get a better job might find themselves...
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.520]   That person might find himself or herself enjoying English literature as a pastime and
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.080]   really finding a passion for English literature of some kind.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.420]   And so I see the same thing happening with Bitcoin.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.880]   This is what I didn't see years ago.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.480]   I thought, "Well, people have to get into Bitcoin because they want to use it as a medium
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.920]   of exchange, but there's a bunch of people getting into Bitcoin because they just want
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.960]   the money to go up.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.120]   They want it to go more valuable than they're going to sell out."
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.360]   The point remains that people are getting into Bitcoin.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.800]   And for every person that buys more Bitcoin, then that's creating a stronger and stronger
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.320]   infrastructure.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.400]   And so when I first bought Bitcoin, I bought Bitcoin because I was interested in observing
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   the market.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.760]   And then I was thinking, "Hey, maybe I can make some money on it."
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.680]   Then I found myself using the Bitcoin more.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.760]   I found myself using it to buy and to sell and to exchange with other people.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.840]   And I realized it doesn't really matter the reason that I'm buying Bitcoin.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.760]   It only matters that I'm buying Bitcoin.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.560]   It doesn't matter why your neighbor is buying Bitcoin.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.000]   It only matters that your neighbor is buying Bitcoin.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.180]   And in the same way that a person who learns English for some romantic language reason
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.200]   can also find themselves getting a better job, the same thing applies to Bitcoin.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.120]   Your neighbor who buys Bitcoin to make a bunch of money might also find Bitcoin being useful
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.240]   in trading on a daily basis.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.400]   Your neighbor who buys Bitcoin to trade on a daily basis might find it useful that it
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.040]   goes up and down and up and down and up probably over the long term.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.480]   And so Bitcoin is already working as a storehouse of value.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.280]   And as you look at the world get more intense, you look at the situation right now of inflation
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.080]   in many Western currencies, you look at uncertainty, you look at increasing monetary controls,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.160]   etc., that Bitcoin is now gaining an increased value in most people's minds.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.920]   So many people at the conference, of course, and I myself am included in this, I look at
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.920]   Bitcoin as being more valuable than US dollars because I look at it over the next 10 years
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.960]   and I say, "Look at the direction these systems are going.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   Look at the trajectory of these systems."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.200]   And I would compare this back to the language metaphor, which might be imperfect, but I
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.760]   think is useful.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.360]   I look at this and I say, "I can appreciate multiple languages while also being very clear
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.520]   on the fact that one language is on the uptrend and another language is on the downtrend."
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:41.280]   And so maybe a good example of US dollars to Bitcoin might be something like Spanish
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   to English.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   Right?
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280]   Spanish is not a dying language.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   It's not a little tribal language from some tribe that's disappeared and done.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.400]   That's a powerful language.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.560]   But yet still, if I speak Spanish, I want to also speak English because the best opportunity
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   is to have the both of them.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.100]   And that's maybe an imperfect metaphor, but it's worth thinking about.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:06.000]   So Bitcoin can have a future and it is already working as a storehouse of value.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.120]   It is already working as a medium of exchange right now, albeit on a relatively limited
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.960]   basis compared to the world's transactions.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.760]   And so this is, again, another problem that I have faced in the past.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.640]   One of the issues when you look at alternative forms of banking that don't involve the
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.920]   fractional reserve system, i.e.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.000]   silver banking, one of the problems you face with precious metals collections is the people
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.340]   who buy and own precious metals often don't want to spend them.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.080]   And because they don't want to spend them, they don't wind up going around and thus
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.440]   the whole idea of banking in that currency or banking in gold and silver often doesn't
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.440]   work.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.760]   And so they're so valuable, there are people perceive them to be so valuable that they
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   often don't spend them.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.240]   They don't want to part with them.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.600]   And this is a problem, right?
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.400]   People are gold bugs or silver bugs.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.160]   They have this basically this dogmatic idea that, well, this is just the ultimate thing
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.960]   of value and nothing else has value.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.160]   And I think that's a mistake.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.880]   I think that when you buy gold coins, you should be ready to sell gold coins.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.120]   When you buy silver coins, you should be able to sell, ready to sell them.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.440]   And when you buy Bitcoin, you should be ready to sell it.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.600]   And so in order to do that, you need to use it as a medium of exchange.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:22.240]   Now the limiting factor for Bitcoin has been very significantly the fact that you always
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.120]   had to get into Bitcoin from fiat and get out of Bitcoin from fiat.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.940]   And I think this is a powerful argument against Bitcoin.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.400]   People say it's not really a currency because you can't buy and sell in that currency.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.840]   That is changing.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.240]   Maybe it was that way 10 years ago, but that is changing.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:46.360]   And I think today you see that more and more people are happy to accept Bitcoin directly,
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.680]   to hold Bitcoin and to spend Bitcoin.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.480]   And I think in the years to come, I see that trend increasing significantly.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.920]   The big news last year was that El Salvador passed a legal tender law stating that people
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.400]   should accept Bitcoin for transactions.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.380]   And so today you can go to El Salvador and you can spend your Bitcoin directly, making
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.640]   instant transfers to purchase goods and services in local stores.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.520]   I see that continuing over the last few days.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   There have been major announcements of these efforts.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:22.440]   There was Lugano, Switzerland, I think, passed a legal tender law for Lugano for Bitcoin.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.920]   The governor, I'm not sure which title to use, but the governor of Madeira, the little
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:34.520]   Portuguese set of islands out near the Azores in the sea, they are moving forward with broad
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.960]   Bitcoin incentives in Madeira.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.840]   Honduras has been threatening to pass a legal tender law.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.560]   Mexico is making noise of trying to figure out how to integrate Bitcoin.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.400]   And I think that this trend is probably going to continue.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.240]   And in my opinion, I think it will continue.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:56.400]   I think there's powerful reasons for a country to move towards Bitcoin adoption.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.240]   And there are many people who are working to encourage nation state adoption of Bitcoin
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.360]   as an official currency and as something that is useful.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:11.120]   When you realize the incredible stranglehold that many countries have on their finances
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.920]   due to the fact that big countries like the United States that control the US dollar can
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.520]   control and affect their financial situation, you can see how attractive it is to a country
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:30.360]   to be decoupled from that form of imperialism by a large international country.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.040]   I won't go deeper into that.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.420]   Countries have made various decisions.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.320]   Some cases they've pegged their currency to the dollar.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.160]   Some cases they've used dollars to get the benefits of the dollar.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:44.400]   But it becomes a point of control when a country is beholden to the dollar.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:52.080]   And so having access to a globalized system that's not controlled by a nation state can
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.960]   be a major competitive advantage for a country.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.840]   And that may be something that continues to develop in the coming years in the Bitcoin
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.120]   space, which would be very exciting.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:07.480]   It would be exciting to see small countries able to compete on a global basis by having
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.320]   access to a large currency, if Bitcoin indeed becomes a large currency, but yet having a
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:18.720]   large currency that's not controllable by or controlled by or controllable by a big
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:25.680]   international imperial power and where they don't become basically a colony of that country
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.480]   by jumping onto that country's currency.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.360]   That would be cool because it's a major disadvantage for a country to have its own currency that's
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.680]   not internationally strong.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.160]   It can subject them to major difficulties on the global basis, but it can be an advantage
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.480]   if they could have access to an internationally stable system that wasn't based upon imperialism
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.240]   like the US dollar or like some other large country currencies.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.820]   Back to the fact that Bitcoin is already working as a medium of exchange.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.320]   It does work.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.560]   And I have bought and sold various things directly for Bitcoin, many of those things.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.200]   And today it's already working.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.720]   And so the solutions that are already out there, there are at least eight, I didn't
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:13.200]   count perfectly, but there are at least eight different custodians of Bitcoin who are now
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:21.400]   offering a debit card directly for your Bitcoin reserves that allow you to buy and sell locally
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.320]   and have the money drawn from your Bitcoin balance.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.400]   With that plus the integration in the digital world, things like Apple Pay, Google Pay,
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.600]   et cetera, bringing those debit cards into those systems means that you can today effectively
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.040]   bank in Bitcoin even if Bitcoin itself is not accepted.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.960]   And I used to think that this was going to be a big problem, but in my travels around
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.640]   the world over the last couple of years, I don't see why it is a problem anymore.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.240]   I do most of my banking in US dollars.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.360]   But when I travel the world, the fact that I do my banking in US dollars doesn't really
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.480]   matter to me on a global basis about spending dollars.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.460]   I just simply go and I buy the stuff that I need and then I click the button on my watch
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.720]   and use Apple Pay or I swipe a US credit card.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.400]   And behind the scenes, the credit card company settles the whole system and my US dollars
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.360]   go and pay my foreign currency.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.520]   And I don't really care what the foreign currency is or even what the local price is.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.220]   And that's an amazing feature of the modern world.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.200]   Why do I say I don't even care what the local price is?
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.160]   Pretty much everywhere in the world you go, the prices are set by the free market system.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.640]   And so the free market system is setting the price.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.880]   You can go into virtually any store in the world, at least a store that includes prices,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.120]   not some local bazaar where haggling is a major component, but you can go into any grocery
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.800]   store all around the world and you can be confident that the prices you're getting on
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.680]   your goods and items there is simply the market price.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   It's what it costs there, factoring in, paying for the transportation, paying for the purchase
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.760]   of the raw materials, paying for the manufacturing, paying for keeping the lights on the store,
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.080]   et cetera, and a little bit of profit for everyone in between.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.300]   And you're going to get a fair just price there.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.840]   And then the international competition for foreign exchange rates is what's setting the
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.520]   exchange rate between your local currency and the US dollar.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.240]   And so the whole system is extremely efficient.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.160]   It's extremely fair.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.360]   And you could just walk into any store in the world, pay with your Apple Pay or Google
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.040]   Pay and be on your way.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.940]   It's fast, easy, and simple.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.600]   And so why can't Bitcoin play a role in that?
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.660]   It is already possible with a system of debit cards and I think will be increasingly possible
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.400]   in the future.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.760]   Then direct Bitcoin for Bitcoin transactions are increasingly doable.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   Today, if someone offers to pay me with Bitcoin, I am more highly incentivized to accept Bitcoin
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.400]   than the US dollar because I believe that there's a stronger future for Bitcoin than
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.120]   for the current iteration of the US dollar.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.360]   And we'll get to that belief in a moment as to why that is.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.680]   Similarly, if someone offers to pay me with a gold coin instead of a US dollar, I'm more
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:02.960]   incentivized to offer a discount, to take something from someone to do provide extra
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.000]   service, et cetera, if someone pays me with something other than a US dollar.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.400]   I still do need to have enough dollars to pay my expenses and my bills.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:18.200]   But I find routinely that these kinds of offers are more attractive to me and I can make my
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.520]   offers attractive to other people.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:26.840]   And as Bitcoin adoption has grown around the world, I think this will be increasingly valuable,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   especially when we get to the efficiency of doing direct Bitcoin for Bitcoin transactions.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.440]   Let's say that you were selling a house today and somebody came to you and made you an offer
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.980]   to make a direct Bitcoin transaction for your house.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.360]   Would you not at least consider it, even if you own no Bitcoin today?
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.320]   Maybe five years ago, the percentage of people who would have considered it would be quite
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   much lower than today.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.840]   But today, there are a lot of people who would consider it and who would perhaps consider
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:01.240]   it on a higher level than simply dollar for dollar transactions.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.420]   So it is already working as a medium of exchange.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.120]   And I think it can continue to work as a medium of exchange.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.920]   Next point, one thing that was clearly evident at this conference that I attended is that
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.760]   Bitcoin has a passionate group of entrepreneurs who are solving the problems with Bitcoin
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.360]   and offering new solutions.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.920]   If you look at the Lightning Network that was developed over the last couple of years,
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:33.160]   if you look at new systems of simply handling transactions, there are so many entrepreneurs
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.120]   that are creating solutions to allow Bitcoin use to be more widespread.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.800]   And there are entrepreneurs and companies that are integrating Bitcoin more and more
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.920]   into their daily affairs.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.060]   And so our world has moved into an electronic system.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.040]   There are benefits, many benefits of that.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.760]   There are also disadvantages of that.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:03.000]   But what you see is that for the disadvantages of an electronic system, some of those disadvantages
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.280]   can be minimized by using a Bitcoin standard instead of a dollar standard.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.600]   And so entrepreneurs have been solving that.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.920]   Five years ago, it may have been hard to believe that electronic transactions would be the
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   norm, 10 years ago perhaps.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.560]   10 years ago, it may have been hard to believe because we used cash a lot more.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.280]   We were so accustomed to physical cards.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.560]   But now, at least in my travels and many places around the world, it's just simply considered
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.900]   standard procedure to have a point of service terminal that is electronic and that doesn't
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.480]   even require any kind of physical card.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.500]   It's going to be a digital payment from a mobile device.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:46.040]   And so Bitcoin can compete in that space very, very effectively as more and more people choose
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.220]   to buy with Bitcoin and more and more vendors choose to sell with Bitcoin.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.640]   And so there's no technical reason that I can see why Bitcoin can't be used more and
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.460]   more as a system of exchange.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.520]   Even some of the behind the scenes problems dealing with currency conversions to local
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.600]   currencies for tax reporting, etc. for merchants.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.740]   I talked with a number of vendors at the conference who were working on solving that and creating
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:16.280]   new bookkeeping systems, etc. to make that automated and simple and easy to stay in compliance
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.080]   with your local tax authorities while still accepting Bitcoin, doing business in Bitcoin,
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   etc.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.200]   I've already spoken about the fact that Bitcoin has increasing global attention.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:33.580]   Right now, that global attention is primarily limited to small, innovative places that don't
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.920]   have a lot of other natural resources to work with.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.160]   But these experiments that are playing out are important experiments and will drive the
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.920]   future to see what happens in years to come in terms of the global adoption.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.560]   One thing that was clearly evident at the conference is that Bitcoin, and is evident
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.800]   for many just cursory examination of the market space, Bitcoin has many of the smartest people
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.840]   in the world deeply invested into it.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.580]   It seems to me, I can't remember what the opposite of a brain drain is, but basically
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.840]   the opposite of a brain drain, a brain collection, a brain vacuum where people are coming to
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.080]   it.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:15.720]   It feels very much like that's what's happening right now in Bitcoin and in the cryptocurrency
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.600]   industry writ large.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:23.760]   You have some of the biggest, smartest people with the most success who are actively targeting
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   it.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:30.040]   And right now, if I'm giving career advice to anybody who's smart and educated, I am
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:37.100]   saying go to the Bitcoin industry or the cryptocurrency industry broadly and see if you can find a
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.680]   problem that needs solving and solve it.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:46.600]   Because it feels very much like we're on the cusp of a transition in the world, in a monetary
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.640]   transition which has been one of the few areas that have been the slowest to respond to the
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.840]   technological revolution that we've all lived in.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:03.340]   If you think about many of the areas of life, whether it's communication was completely
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.760]   disrupted by internet connectivity.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   If you look at marketing, it's been completely disrupted by internet connectivity.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.440]   Telecommunication has been deeply disrupted by internet connectivity, even just much faster
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.640]   with the pandemic.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.240]   But money has been one of the slower areas to be disrupted.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.840]   It has been significantly disrupted in terms of international transfer payments with PayPal,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   etc.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.200]   It has been disrupted with merchant terminal systems of Stripe, etc.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.940]   But the actual basic components of money has been slow to be disrupted.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.580]   But it feels like we're on the cusp of a change and it feels like all the smart people are
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.840]   rushing to that industry to try to solve problems and make a fortune.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.200]   And I think that's a smart move.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.320]   I have a number of clients that I work with on an ongoing basis.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.720]   I walked out of the Bitcoin conference and I called one of my clients who is very smart
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:04.360]   and involved in different things and I said, "I would be working very hard if I were you
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.560]   to figure out how can you be around this industry?"
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.320]   Because when there's a growth industry, a raising tide raises all boats.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   That's the basic concept.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.740]   It's that when you're in an industry where there's growth, you have an opportunity, even
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.840]   if you're middle of the pack, you have an opportunity to experience the growth of that
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   industry.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:28.360]   And it feels to me, I think that Bitcoin is right on that point where you don't even need
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.600]   – as an entrepreneur, you don't even need a new and innovative product.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.360]   You simply need a good product that solves a problem where there are other competitors
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.440]   who can come in and you can work in that space as well.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:47.480]   Think about this in terms of – what example to use?
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   You can go to any industry.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.160]   I guess the point is simply that any industry, whether it's everything from cars to computers
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:00.120]   to cash registers, it might be great to be the early prime mover in an industry.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.200]   It might be.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.080]   But it's also excellent to be company number three, company number five, company number
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.640]   eight that's creating something that's solving a problem for consumers in that industry.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.960]   Because one company cannot solve all the problems.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.920]   One company can't meet all the needs.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.160]   And so there's plenty of room for competition.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.280]   And so I think there's tons of room for competition right now in the Bitcoin industry.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:29.000]   And the fact that many of the smartest people in the world are deeply invested into it is
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.640]   an important component to pay attention to.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   There are very smart people who are critics.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.400]   But that number of smart people who are critics is a lot smaller today than it was a number
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.320]   of years ago.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.820]   And I find it difficult to understand the arguments to believe the critics more than
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:54.560]   I find it difficult to believe the proponents myself.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.560]   And so we'll see.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.560]   We'll see what happens.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   We don't know yet.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.920]   We'll see.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.080]   When you get a whole bunch of smart people focusing on a problem and then working on
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.160]   solutions, you're probably going to get better solutions.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.040]   Here I think of the classic book by Jim Collins called Good to Great.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.000]   One of the points that he made in that book, excellent management book for building great
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.680]   companies was this.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.520]   One of his chapters was get the right people on the bus, then figure out where the bus
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.800]   is going.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.240]   And he said, if you're a company, if you can get a bunch of the right people on the bus,
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.960]   then you can figure out what direction to take the bus.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.880]   Don't say the bus is going here.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.880]   First get the people.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.600]   And to me, that's what it felt like being at the Bitcoin conference is that all the
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.800]   right people are on the bus.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.080]   So now let's figure out where the bus is going.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.200]   And maybe the bus goes where we thought it was going to go five years ago.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.520]   But you can't have that many smart people on the bus working on problems and then not
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.480]   have the bus go somewhere good, which leads me to my next point.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:59.940]   One of the things that deeply impressed me at the Bitcoin conference was how ideological
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.520]   the enthusiasts were.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.680]   And I mean that in the sense that if you talk about people wanting free control and sovereignty
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.320]   over their money, they were there at the Bitcoin conference.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.440]   That was why it was.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.040]   Yes, I think everyone who was there wants to get rich.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.480]   Who among us doesn't?
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.880]   I think we would all love it if Bitcoin went to a million dollars, everyone who owns Bitcoin.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:31.240]   But I didn't come away with thinking that everyone was focused on the concept of making
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   a million bucks.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.360]   I came away with the impression, listening to speakers and talking to people, I came
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.680]   away with the impression that everyone was focused on the concept of building a free
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:44.280]   currency that's not dependent on government intervention.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.920]   And when you have a bunch of people that are committed passionately to an ideology, then
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.680]   I think you can really move the needle in that direction.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.760]   The examples I thought of, I think you could go to an older example like the United States
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.280]   of America.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:04.720]   The founding of the United States of America was created by a set of committed ideologues.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.840]   You had, at its very core, you had the pilgrims going over to the United States for religious
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   freedom.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.640]   It's why there's more religious freedom in the United States than virtually any country
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.680]   in the world.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.760]   And that religious freedom has not subsided over time because it was built into the culture,
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:24.320]   this sense of, "I am going to be free to worship God as I want."
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:33.280]   And even though there have been massive erosions in religious liberty, at its core, that strong
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.760]   respect of religious liberty is so fundamental to the American experience and the American
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.960]   concept that it can't be gotten away from, no matter what.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.540]   And so that's kind of how it feels, is that the people...
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:52.400]   But the people who did it, they sacrificed their lives, their fortunes, and everything
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.320]   for that concept.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.560]   So you started with religious liberty, then political liberty, as the ethos of the founding
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.000]   of the country is, "We're going to sacrifice everything for this sense of political liberty."
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.280]   And that, again, drove a stake into the heart of the American culture that continues to
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.320]   this day, a deep sense of liberty being the highest thing.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:18.060]   You look at the global experience of the last two years, and the proof of that is stark
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:22.500]   in terms of how different the US-American experience of liberty was over the last two
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.940]   years versus the Australian experience or the Canadian experience.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.380]   It's obvious, but it goes back to the very beginning.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.460]   And so you have a committed set of ideologues.
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:37.580]   Those committed, small group of committed ideologues can make a cultural difference
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.300]   that endures for a significant amount of time.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:45.100]   And at the conference, all I could hear was the ideology coming through, the ideology
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:50.940]   of personal sovereignty, freedom from government coercion, from government control, not building
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.460]   an inflationary system that benefits a few, but rather giving people an honest monetary
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.460]   system.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:01.380]   And that ideology really, really impressed me.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.180]   It was so obvious, and it came through so loud and clear, that I couldn't walk away
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.340]   and think that there was anything except, "Hey, here are the right people on the bus,
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.500]   a lot of them for the right reasons.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.140]   This bus is going to go somewhere."
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:22.020]   And I think very well, Bitcoin may become the first peaceful monetary system in existence.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:31.660]   I was struck by watching the international opprobrium of Russians and the Russian currency
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:37.220]   over the past months, and thinking about how that applies to Bitcoin.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:43.620]   If you look at it right now, holding rubles for most people, given the immoral actions
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:51.180]   of the Russian government, has become a deeply difficult thing to do from an ethical standard.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.900]   We think about blood diamonds or blood money or something like that.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.180]   That's kind of how it feels, the concept of holding rubles.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:03.020]   It feels like, "I'm supporting this regime that's invading its neighbors, and I don't
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.700]   feel good about this."
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:10.060]   Well, I have a similar feeling about the US dollar, and I think that many thoughtful people
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.500]   who examine the facts would come to a similar feeling.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.380]   The problem is, it's hard to promote an alternative.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:24.220]   Even though I have concerns about the US dollar and the behavior of the US government, etc.,
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:29.300]   it's a mixed bag, and it's not all bad, it's not all good.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.980]   It's a real mixed bag.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.180]   You look at it, it's not super motivating to find an alternative.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.780]   Then you look at the alternatives, and many of the alternatives are hard to do.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.020]   They're hard to integrate.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.340]   But if you could come up with an easy alternative that didn't have all that baggage, if you
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:52.140]   could create a system that allowed people to hold value and to exchange with their neighbors,
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:58.580]   and that system of exchange didn't have all the baggage of a nation-state actor, then
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.140]   I think in time that's going to be attractive.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:08.900]   You heard that attractiveness loud and clear through so many attendees of the Bitcoin conference.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.820]   It was so loud and clear that I think it probably will continue.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:17.620]   As it becomes easier and easier to buy Bitcoin, to own Bitcoin, to hold Bitcoin, to trade
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:23.980]   in Bitcoin, to sell Bitcoin, etc., I think you're going to see broader adoption of it.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:31.620]   And I think that I'll wrap up this commentary with this.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.940]   Maybe the price appreciation was necessary.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.580]   Maybe the price appreciation is still necessary.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.100]   That's the thing that bothered me for years, is I thought, "How can this be money if it's
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.100]   so unstable?"
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.100]   It's just going up.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.100]   But when I got to the Bitcoin conference and I saw the people there who are undoubtedly
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:55.980]   there for a combination of make a bunch of money and also support this ideologically,
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.340]   maybe the price appreciation is not a negative factor.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.340]   Maybe it's a positive factor.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:06.460]   And you think about it, I thought a lot over the last years, "Why shouldn't your money
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.780]   increase in value?
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.260]   Why shouldn't it happen?"
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.980]   First, we know that massive fluctuations and instability in the foreign exchange markets
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:15.980]   are commonplace.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:20.660]   They're less that the fluctuations between the big currencies are much smaller than they
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.780]   are on a global basis.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:28.580]   But the fluctuations of the US dollar versus local, the lira, or whatever local currency
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.460]   you want to do, these are significant fluctuations.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:35.300]   So fluctuation is not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.260]   And why shouldn't your money increase in value?
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.180]   I think that's one of the strangest things that I've only learned by experience.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:47.100]   And I learned it when I first bought gold and I learned it when I first bought Bitcoin.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:54.100]   You realize that one of the reasons why I spend so much money in US dollars is I fundamentally
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:58.100]   believe that those US dollars are eroding in value.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.940]   And you know they are with inflation and you know that there's no chance that it's going
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.800]   to change.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.740]   You don't keep money when you think it's going to erode in value.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.780]   And this is one of the reasons why inflation is baked into the system at the nation state
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.940]   level because the government wants to incentivize people to spend their money.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.100]   Because on every-- why?
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.100]   Who knows?
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.820]   There are many good reasons, right?
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.780]   An economy with lots of economic movement is generally going to be a healthier economy.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:28.420]   You could take the conspiratorial side and say the government only gets tax money when
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.500]   money changes hands, which is true.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:35.860]   So you want to generate tax money to increase the power of government, you have to have
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.460]   money moving.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.340]   Other arguments as well.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.220]   But it is a kind of a strange scenario when you realize I might actually want to hang
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.500]   on to my money.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.620]   And you find that when you buy gold, you find that when you buy Bitcoin, you think, you
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.620]   know what?
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.160]   I think my money is going to be worth more in the future than it is today.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.020]   So let me just hang on to my money.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:01.020]   Even if it's not an investment, let me just hang on to my money.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.060]   And that feels good.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.100]   And that's something that fundamentally went against all of my professional training, goes
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.300]   against my professional training.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.740]   Professional training says you should only hold a small amount of money in cash and you
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.420]   should hold most of your money in investments.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.860]   And that makes sense in a fiat system.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.660]   It makes sense in an inflationary fiat system.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.220]   But maybe it doesn't make sense.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.060]   And maybe it shouldn't make sense.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.560]   You go back to a gold-based system and you realize there was actually incentive for people
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.300]   just to hold money.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:33.500]   You could hold gold dollars and you could just hold money.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.420]   You didn't have to go and invest it into a company.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.580]   You didn't have to go and invest it into real estate.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.420]   You didn't have to worry about getting rid of your money.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.380]   You could just simply hold it.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:46.260]   Why shouldn't we have that kind of system in the future?
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:55.300]   So in summary, I'm convinced there's tremendous opportunity for Bitcoin from an ideological
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.860]   perspective, which to repeat is my big thing.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.420]   And I'm convinced there's tremendous opportunity for Bitcoin from an investment perspective.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.500]   I'm convinced that there's tremendous opportunity.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:15.460]   At this point in time, I have a very hard time seeing the Bitcoin at zero scenarios
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:20.860]   being plausible, at least in the short term.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.860]   Who knows?
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:28.580]   You go out into the long term and it's very hard to be confident in a long-term prediction.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:30.980]   But I have a hard time seeing Bitcoin at zero.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:37.060]   And when I look at the utility to me and to my life, especially from an ideological perspective,
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.780]   it makes it a strong, strong case.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:46.060]   And when you look at how so many people around the world have, the entrepreneurs have been
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.460]   developing solutions to the problems, I think it's just going to continue.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.660]   And its solutions are already really, really good.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.780]   And I think they're going to get even better.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.940]   So yeah, I'm in.
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:00.940]   I'm in.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.900]   I'm convinced that there's a strong and powerful future.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:10.220]   What I don't yet know is I don't yet know how to integrate it properly into good financial
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.220]   planning.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:15.100]   I've been thinking a lot about that.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:20.060]   And this is where you get into that argument between a currency and an investment.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:24.260]   If you think of Bitcoin as a currency and you were a financial planner, you wouldn't
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.500]   say to somebody, "Well, go put all your money into a currency.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.740]   You still want people to invest."
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:31.700]   But Bitcoin is kind of that mixture.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.060]   So I don't want to go deeper into that right now.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:36.740]   But I've been thinking about some of the financial planning problems considering that.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:42.420]   There were a couple of, I wasn't going to go into this, but there are a couple of really
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:47.740]   innovative solutions that I started to see from the financial perspective at this conference.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:53.180]   There were basically four vendors who were involved in things more related to traditional
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.420]   financial planning.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:00.380]   Two of them related to real estate where they were developing some cool things about taking
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.820]   equity from real estate, putting it into Bitcoin.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:06.460]   And I thought that was remarkably smart.
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.520]   But they're doing, and then a couple of people working on insurance products.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.180]   But the insurance products are not yet, nothing is being done in Bitcoin.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:17.340]   And so I think there's going to be a lot of smart finance people over the coming years
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:22.580]   trying to think, "How can we use what we know now and how can we move it into a new
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:23.580]   direction?"
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:27.580]   And that's where we get into the world of smart contracts, DAOs, all kinds of stuff
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.620]   that's kind of more interesting.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.340]   But we're definitely at a pivot point and there's change coming.
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.500]   So that was my experience from the Bitcoin conference.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:42.820]   If you're interested, Bitcoin 2022, they put all of their sessions on their website.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.140]   Just go to YouTube.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.140]   It's all available.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.820]   You can watch all the conferences, some great speakers.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.980]   Jack Dorsey was there.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.180]   I really enjoyed the talk of Ricardo Salinas.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.900]   He's a Mexican billionaire.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:59.740]   And his comment, he was sharing from his experience of having, living through the Mexican hyperinflation
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.780]   of the 1980s and how his family got screwed again and again.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.540]   He said that his family holdings are now 60% in Bitcoin.
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.620]   And of course, many of the other Bitcoin people.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.580]   But I mean, it was Saylor, Michael Saylor, et cetera, who were there.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.860]   But all that's available for you on YouTube free.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:21.420]   So if you're interested in education, that's there and you can watch those talks and more
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.420]   to come.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.580]   I guess I should simply promote.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.580]   I have a course.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:30.340]   One of the things that I saw a need in the marketplace for was a course on how to buy
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.820]   Bitcoin and own it privately and anonymously.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:37.660]   And I think this is one of the most valuable things about Bitcoin is that you can own it,
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:41.920]   you can buy it anonymously, you could own it privately and you can do that on a really
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.980]   effective basis.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.460]   And so if you're interested in that, make sure you go and take my course called Bitcoin
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.300]   Privacy Course dot com.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.860]   How to buy Bitcoin, own it anonymously, et cetera.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.580]   And done amazing.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:58.460]   Got some great solutions there and even better solutions coming in the days to come.
