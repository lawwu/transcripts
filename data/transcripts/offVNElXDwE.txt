[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We come this evening in our consideration of the epistle to the Romans to verses 5 and
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.720]   6 in the sixth chapter, the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, verses 5
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.200]   and 6.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.440]   "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.400]   in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.320]   that henceforth we should not serve sin."
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.040]   Now we are engaged at this moment in this argument, you remember, that the apostle is
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.960]   working out in these verses.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.240]   He is dealing with this objection that is brought to his preaching of justification
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.320]   by faith, namely, that it seems to suggest that we should therefore continue in sin,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.000]   that grace may abound.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.480]   That he says is impossible because we died to sin, and how can we who died to sin live
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   any longer therein?
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.920]   But he is not content merely with laying down that great proposition.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.760]   He now goes on to show why that is true and how that came to pass.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.600]   And it is because, he says, we have been baptized into Christ, we have been joined to him.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.240]   And the result of that is that what has happened to him has happened to us.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.560]   And you remember, we have seen how he works it out.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.600]   As many of us, he says, were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.040]   we were also in the same way baptized into his burial, in the same way we are baptized
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.640]   into his resurrection.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.980]   Now that is what he has been working out in verses 3 and 4.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:18.900]   And he ended on that note, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory,
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.340]   the glorious power of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.300]   Now that is the point at which he has been wanting to arrive.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.620]   This suggestion about continuing in sin is quite monstrous.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.500]   We have not only died to sin, but we are also positively in a new life, in a new realm.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.260]   We have not only been baptized into the death of Christ, we have been baptized also into
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620]   his resurrection.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.900]   As he was raised up by the glorious power of the Father, even so we also should walk
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.540]   in newness of life, in this new life.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.740]   Now that is the point at which we have arrived, and so we can look at verse 5.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:19.300]   Now verse 5, in a sense, is a repetition and a summary of what he has already been saying
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.260]   in those two verses, 3 and 4.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.340]   But it also goes a little beyond that.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340]   It is not mere repetition.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.940]   It does not stop at being a summary.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.620]   For if he says we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.460]   also in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:50.580]   Now the apostle takes the trouble to make this statement, which as I say is, in a sense,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.820]   a repetition of what he has already been saying, because he is anxious to emphasize that last
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:07.780]   statement in verse 4, which is again, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.020]   That is the point he wants to get over, that we are walking in this newness of life.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.740]   So again, to demonstrate it, he says, for if, you see, we have been planted together
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:28.260]   in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.300]   Now this, therefore, is a verse which can be regarded in many senses as a pivotal statement,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.140]   having worked the process, the thing out in detail and from step to step.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.260]   Here, he says, is the big thing, so he states it now as a whole.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.460]   And it is a very important verse, therefore, for us to grasp.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.180]   You notice that it has got two sections in it.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.780]   It consists of two halves.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.140]   If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also, number two,
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.180]   in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.300]   And from the strict standpoint of mechanics, let us observe this.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.100]   He expounds the first half of this fifth verse in verses 6 and 7.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.300]   He expounds the second half in verses 8, 9, and 10.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   It is a very closely woven argument, this.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.420]   The texture is fine.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.740]   The apostle is handling a tremendous theme, and it is important we should try to keep
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.620]   clear the exact mechanics of the way in which he is doing it.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.540]   So I trust we are all clear about this now.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.260]   He laid down proposition in verse 2.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.020]   He establishes it, as it were, in 3 and 4.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.220]   He now then states it in a slightly different way in verse 5, and then he will work it out
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.380]   again in detail, in still greater detail, in verses 6 and 7, and then 8, 9, and 10 for
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.780]   the second portion.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.020]   Now the big thing still to hold in our minds is this, is that what matters above everything
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.940]   else is our union with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.800]   We are baptized into him, and it is because we are thus united with him by this baptism
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.300]   that these things are true of us.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.700]   Let us never forget that the whole point of saying it all is to answer that false objection
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.260]   which is mentioned in verse 1.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.260]   Very well.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.860]   Now then, let us look at verse 5.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.740]   For if, he says—now let nobody be led astray by the word "if."
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.300]   It does not mean there is any doubt at all.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.540]   It does not mean that there is any query about it.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   It means this.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.260]   It really means "since."
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.660]   Since we have been planted together in the likeness of his death.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.620]   You see, it is a common form of arguing.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.380]   If you agree that that is true, well then, this must also be true.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.660]   That is what it means.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.940]   It means "since," rather than what we sometimes mean when we use "if" as if to raise a doubt.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.620]   Since it is a fact that we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, well
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.540]   then it must be a fact also that we have been planted together in the likeness of his resurrection
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.540]   also.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.540]   Now, take this word "planted."
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.620]   I referred to it hurriedly about a fortnight ago.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.420]   It is a word that means "growing together."
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:41.700]   Growing together in such an intimate way that it means an essential union.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.580]   That is the meaning of the term "planted."
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.580]   Union by growth.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.180]   A joint growth becoming one.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.220]   United together.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.740]   It expresses, therefore, a very, very definite and a very real union.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.940]   Then note in brackets that that is in no sense a figure of baptism.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.900]   We dealt with that a fortnight tonight, as I say.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.900]   But here it is.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:16.500]   The thing he is anxious for us to get hold of is that we are thus united as branches
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   in the vine.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.820]   It is that unity in growth and in everything else.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.380]   Planted together.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:31.460]   Once more he is emphasizing the intimate nature of the union of the believer with his Lord.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.820]   Then we must just look for a moment at the word "likeness."
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.980]   We have been planted together, he says, in the likeness of his death.
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.980]   Why that?
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.660]   Well, for this reason.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.700]   Our death and resurrection is not identical with the Lord's.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.700]   Everything that happened to him, of course, was unique because he was who he was, because
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.060]   he is the eternal Son of God.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.400]   Everything that happened to him, therefore, has a speciality and a uniqueness about it
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.640]   that can never be true of us.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:10.540]   So he uses the term "likeness" just to help us to keep that distinction in our minds.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.480]   Our death and our resurrection are in the likeness of his, but they are not identical
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.380]   with his.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.900]   We shall never know the suffering he knew.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.940]   We shall never know many other things which he knew.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.900]   Here is a word, perhaps, which will help you to grasp the meaning.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:32.380]   We are not told that our Lord came into this world in sinful flesh, but we are told that
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.380]   he came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.820]   You see the distinction there.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:47.100]   So it means this, that what has happened to him, literally and actually, happens to us
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   spiritually.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.740]   There is a spiritual sense in which it is true to say that we have died with him.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.040]   We did not die with him literally, physically.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.540]   We shall never know the agony that he knew in his death.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:07.940]   No, but what is important is this, that because of our spiritual relationship to him, the
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:14.980]   effects and consequences of his actual, literal death become ours and are passed on to us.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.020]   In other words, go back to Adam.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:23.780]   We were not literally in Adam when he sinned, yet spiritually we were in Adam when he sinned.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.180]   It is the same parallel still.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:33.400]   But so it is a very accurate term, this "in the likeness of his death and in the likeness
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.140]   of his resurrection."
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.620]   What happened to him actually, physically, happens to us spiritually.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.060]   We have all the benefits and the results of that death and resurrection.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:53.980]   So he calls it being planted in the likeness of his death and in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.060]   There is no real difficulty about it, but lest somebody may wonder why he used the term
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.380]   likeness, that is the explanation.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.100]   And the other expression I must take up is this one, because people have sometimes been
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.220]   misled by it.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:15.180]   He says, "We shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection."
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:22.220]   Now this expression, "shall be," has led some people to think that this refers only to our
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.100]   future, literal, bodily resurrection.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.540]   Now it is important that we should see that it does not mean that only.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.620]   As I am going to show you, I believe it includes that.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.980]   But if you say that it only means that, you are really saying something that makes the
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.580]   whole argument of the apostle at this point quite useless.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:55.480]   Because the apostle is here concerned to show how we can never continue in sin that grace
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   may abound.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.860]   Well, now that refers to something which happens to us in this life and in this world.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.020]   He is not arguing there about what we are going to be like after we have risen from
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.540]   the dead in a literal sense.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:13.460]   He is concerned about the life we live as Christian believers in this world, in the
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.940]   here and now.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.740]   And he has said at the end of verse 4 that we should walk in newness of life.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.740]   Where?
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.740]   In the state of glorification?
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   No.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.120]   Here, while we are still left in this world.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:34.840]   Now then, in exactly the same way, this "shall be" refers also to this present life.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.200]   What he is concerned about is this.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.580]   You see, he says "shall be" for this reason only.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:51.620]   It is a future, only from the standpoint of our being dead with him and buried with him.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.100]   It is something that follows.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.400]   It is future from death.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.340]   It is not future in the sense that it means the life in the world to come.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.040]   Now verse 11 of course makes this absolutely certain.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.140]   This is not even a matter of opinion, it seems to me.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.540]   And it is because people take a verse on its own and forget the context that they can ever
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.380]   go astray about this.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.580]   The apostle there puts it like this.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:28.120]   "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, now, but alive unto
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.760]   God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   When?
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.040]   Well now.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.640]   We are to reckon ourselves in the here and now to be dead to sin and alive unto God through
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.800]   our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.020]   So when he talks about our having been planted together in the likeness of his death and
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:52.040]   says we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, he says this, "A man who dies
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.440]   with him shall also rise with him."
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.240]   It is a continuous action.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.380]   You cannot take part, he says, in the death only because you are in him.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.940]   You take part in all he has done, death and life.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.900]   As he died and rose, so you die and rise.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:14.840]   So the "shall be" is not a simple future which has reference only to that beyond this
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   life.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.080]   Very well, then what does he mean by the likeness of his resurrection?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.240]   He means this.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.920]   He means this newness of life to which he is referred at the end of chapter 4.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.960]   We have been raised with Christ into a new life.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.800]   We are no longer in that old life under the dominion and the tyranny of sin.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   No, no.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.440]   We have been taken right out of it.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   We died out of it.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.940]   We have risen out of it.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:50.900]   We are in this new life in this world, even here and now.
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:56.000]   Not only does that get mentioned in verse 4, but listen again to verse 10.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.400]   "For in that he, Christ, died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.400]   unto God.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.680]   And if he liveth and liveth unto God, we do also."
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.160]   That is the argument.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.840]   And that is, I say, in the here and now.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   And hence the appeal and the exhortation in verse 11, "Reckon ye also yourselves to
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:29.220]   be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.120]   Even in the here and now.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   Now, I am emphasizing that for this reason.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.160]   You remember that I, at occasion, I think still a fortnight or so ago, or three weeks
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   ago perhaps, criticized the great Robert Haldane in his interpretation of that statement in
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.360]   verse 2, which says that we died to sin.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.600]   And Haldane, you remember, says that that means that we died to the guilt of sin.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.440]   And he stops at that.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.480]   And I rejected that, because I said it does not mean merely that we died to the guilt
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   of sin, but we died to the reign of sin altogether.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.040]   Now, here is absolute proof of that.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.560]   We are not left in the grave.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.160]   We have risen to newness of life, and we are to walk in newness of life.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.520]   Now, this is what the apostle is concerned about.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.760]   Not only are we dead to the guilt of sin, we are dealt to the whole reign and realm
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   of sin.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.960]   That is the thing he is emphasizing.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.600]   And here is the final proof of it.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.120]   We are so out of its territory that we are in this new territory.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.920]   We are living in this new life with Christ, because we have been raised with him.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.880]   And that, I say, is the final proof of the inadequacy of Haldane's interpretation of
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.560]   verse 2.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:17:00.480]   In other words, what he is saying once more is that our relationship to sin has been entirely
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:10.800]   changed, even as our Lord's relationship was entirely changed when he rose again from the
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.160]   dead.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.120]   You remember last Friday I emphasized this, that he had come into the realm and territory
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.920]   of sin for the time being in order to save us.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.360]   But the moment he was dead and buried and rose again, he finished with it, as he says
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:32.600]   there in verse 10, in that he died unto sin, he died unto sin once, and once and forever
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.160]   he is finished with it.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   So have we.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.880]   That is the whole argument.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.720]   But I think this statement even goes further.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.920]   I believe that he does look forward also to the future, because our salvation includes
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:52.840]   the resurrection of the body and the glorification of the body.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:00.060]   For the time being, we are only in the likeness of Christ's resurrection, spiritually.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:06.440]   But there is a day coming when we shall be also glorified even in our bodies, even as
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.060]   he is.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.960]   That is what the apostle says, you remember, in Philippians 3.20.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.480]   We look for the Savior, he says, the coming of the Savior, who shall change this, our
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.360]   vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:31.800]   working of his power, whereby he is able to subdue even all things unto himself.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.480]   I believe, therefore, that it includes that.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.780]   And what he is saying is this.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:44.380]   If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.400]   of his resurrection.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.960]   We are already this, essentially spiritually.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   But the day is coming when we shall be so in every respect.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.260]   We shall be without spot or wrinkle, faultless and blameless.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.440]   We shall be perfect and glorified.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.740]   We shall stand before him and see him as he is and be like him.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:13.720]   I think it includes even that, because, again, the great thing he is concerned about here
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.760]   is to bring out the triumph of grace, its complete triumph.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.640]   There will be nothing left.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   All the work will have been completed, and our redemption shall be absolutely perfect
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   and entire.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:34.400]   Well, now then, what the apostle is here emphasizing, of course, is the certainty of all this.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.120]   We shall be also.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.280]   You see, it follows, doesn't it, if we are in Christ.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:48.880]   But then we must, of necessity, share in all that has resulted from his action.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.120]   Because we have been baptized into him, planted into him, joined in this intimate manner with
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:04.480]   him, it follows of necessity that if we have died with him as we have, we shall also, in
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.200]   this full and final sense, be raised with him.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.760]   Now, you notice the apostle says exactly the same thing there in that second epistle of
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.040]   Timothy chapter 2 and verse 11, which we read at the beginning.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.680]   He said it is a faithful saying.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:26.580]   If we have died with him, we shall also live with him.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.000]   If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Did you notice it?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.360]   It is exactly the same argument.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.160]   If we are in Christ, well, this is absolutely certain.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.800]   Though you are in the flesh at the moment, and are conscious of weakness and frailty
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.560]   and sin and failure, may be persecuted and buffeted and tried and tempted, it is all
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.200]   right, says the apostle.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.360]   The Lord knoweth them that are his.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.680]   The foundation of God standeth sure.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.080]   The Lord knoweth them that are his.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.300]   And there, guaranteed, nothing can stop it.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.840]   It is certain.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.240]   Whatever we may be doing now, we are suffering with him very well.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.360]   It is equally certain that we shall reign with him and be in glory with him.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.280]   It is a faithful saying, this.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.480]   Let there be no doubt or hesitation about believing it and living upon it.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.960]   It is one of those absolute certainties.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:27.400]   Here is a young man, you see, like Timothy, who is depressed and unhappy, having problems
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.240]   and difficulties and trials and persecutions.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:38.480]   Look here, Timothy says to Paul, "Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.880]   raised from the dead according to my gospel.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.320]   And anybody who is in him is raised already spiritually, and will finally be raised, even
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.080]   in his body and in every other aspect.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   Remember that.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.960]   Hold on to that."
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.520]   And then he says, "You will not be overcome by the things that are happening to you, but
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:04.480]   you will know how to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   Same thing, same argument exactly, only that he puts it there to Timothy in a little more
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.040]   pastoral manner than he does in this sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.560]   In other words, I say once more, and I am repeating as the apostle goes on repeating
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.280]   it, because we are all so slow to grasp it.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.360]   The whole point is this, he says.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.600]   We are under the reign of grace.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:39.680]   We are under the powerful reign of grace, and it is so powerful that sin has been defeated,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.280]   that devil and hell have been defeated.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.780]   Christ is victorious.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.960]   We see not yet all things put under men, but we see Jesus.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.400]   Well, look at him.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.600]   Keep looking at him.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.440]   And because you are in him, you are with him spiritually, you will be with him entirely.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.280]   That is the argument.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:05.760]   And of course, in the light of this, he says, "Is there anything more monstrous and ridiculous
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.240]   than to suggest that therefore all this means that we can continue in sin, that grace may
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.640]   abound?"
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.120]   He says, "The thing is idiotic.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.440]   Everything that has happened in Jesus Christ was designed to take us out of that realm
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.280]   of sin and to put us into this new realm."
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:31.240]   And so he ridicules this at first plausible criticism that had been brought against his
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:38.520]   teaching of justification by faith only and the reign of grace.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.880]   We died with him in order to what?
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:48.720]   Well, that we might rise with him and risen with him we walk in newness of life.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.560]   As he has finished with that, so have we.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.680]   We have finished with it once and forever.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.440]   Well now then, the apostle now is concerned that having laid down this great statement
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.480]   in its two halves, that we should grasp it in its details.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.840]   So he proceeds to work it out for us.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.720]   You remember that I said that he takes the first half, which is that we have been planted
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:18.120]   together in the likeness of his death, and he works that out in verses six and seven.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.120]   Let us follow him.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:30.800]   Here is verse six, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:38.600]   of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.440]   Let me give you a better translation.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.320]   "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him."
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.520]   That is what Paul wrote, "was crucified," not "is," but "was."
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.920]   It has happened in the past.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   It is an aorist.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   It is complete.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   It has happened.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.720]   We are not being crucified.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.040]   We have the old man, was crucified with him.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be disannulled
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   or might be rendered void or ineffective, that henceforth we should not be slaves of
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.200]   sin."
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.760]   Very well, let us take it as he has put it.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:28.920]   The first thing we have to look at is this expression, "knowing this."
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   What does he mean here?
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.680]   Why does he put it in that form?
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:38.720]   Well, it is to again remind us that this is something which we should all know, something
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   with which we should be perfectly familiar, something concerning which we should have
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.440]   an absolute certainty.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   That is what he means.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440]   That is his expression.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.480]   He has used a strong term.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.200]   I am again amazed somewhat that the great Charles Hobbes says that this is experimental
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   knowledge.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.840]   I think you will find my whole exposition will be to say that it is not experimental,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.080]   and that to take it experimental is to lead to utter confusion.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.360]   It is not experimental knowledge, but it is the knowledge of faith.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.760]   It is the knowledge which is revealed in the Scripture and of which faith is certain.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.360]   He is emphasizing the certainty of it, but it is not an experimental certainty.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.120]   It is the certainty of faith.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.040]   It is the full assurance of faith.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.480]   Now he is emphasizing, I say, that we should all know this.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.600]   And therefore I make no apology, my friends, for stopping for a moment to ask you a simple
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   question.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.040]   Do you know this?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.640]   Do you always live in the light of this knowledge?
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.480]   Is this something of which you are absolutely certain?
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.320]   It is important I should press the question, isn't it?
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.840]   We are familiar with this epistle to the Romans, had we realized that this is what it was saying,
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:04.600]   and that the apostle writes to these Romans, whom he has never yet met, saying, "Knowing
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.560]   this," this is something that every Christian should know.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:16.120]   This is an essential, vital part of the very beginning of our true salvation.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.440]   Knowing this, well, what is it we know?
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:29.840]   That our old man was crucified together with him.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.960]   Crucified together with him.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   But here we come to this important term, "the old man."
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.480]   What does it mean?
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.080]   I suppose there is no term that so frequently troubles Christian people as the term "the
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.800]   old man."
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.280]   Everybody who is concerned about sanctification is concerned about this expression, "the old
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.280]   man."
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:28:00.560]   There are people who have spent their lives in trying to kill their old man, to get rid
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.320]   of the old man.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:10.360]   It was the thing that took people into cells and caves on the tops of the mountains that
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.920]   made them become anchorites.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.040]   It is the whole meaning of monasticism.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.480]   It is the great effort to get rid of the old man.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.760]   That is the whole meaning of monasticism in every shape and form, and all mutilations
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.680]   of the flesh, scarifications of the flesh.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.520]   It's all an attempt to get rid of this old man.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.960]   What is this old man?
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.440]   It's because, I say, that there is confusion as to the interpretation of this term, that
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.960]   all that kind of Christianity and that view of the Christian life has ever crept in.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   Well, what does it mean?
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:53.160]   Well, then I say, first of all, it doesn't mean the carnal nature and all its propensities.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.080]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.920]   He's not saying that our carnal nature and all its propensities was crucified together
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   with Christ.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:11.880]   Neither does it mean our moral being previous to our rebirth.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:17.520]   Neither does it mean the flesh with its affections and lusts.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.520]   Now, why am I so concerned with these negatives?
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.160]   Well, because, as I want to show you.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.360]   If you identify the old man with any one of those, well, then you will, of necessity,
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.760]   be in hopeless confusion, because there are other scriptures which we've got to consider.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.160]   What then does he mean by old man?
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   Well, it doesn't mean either simply old in the sense that I am now something different.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.760]   Well, what does it mean?
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:54.520]   Well, it seems to me to be so obvious and plain if we take the whole connection together,
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.320]   starting in chapter 5, verse 12.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:05.200]   The old man is the man that I used to be in Adam.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.320]   How can it mean anything else here?
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.600]   It's been the whole context since chapter 5, verse 12.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.400]   I was a man in Adam.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.680]   I am now a man in Christ.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   What's the old man?
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   Well, it's that man that I was, and which I no longer am.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:32.360]   We have seen so abundantly that that old man that I was in Christ is the one that was crucified
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.640]   with Christ.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.400]   He came in and took hold of that man, made it part of himself, in order that he might
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.160]   do away with it and take it out of me.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.420]   I have ceased to be the man that I was in Adam.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.640]   I am no longer in Adam as a Christian.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.040]   I am in Christ.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:58.000]   So the old man that I can look back upon is that man that I was there.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.520]   It's my old humanity.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.640]   It isn't my carnal sinful nature.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.000]   That is still here, but the old man is gone.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   He's been crucified.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.760]   Ah, but says someone, crucifixion is a very slow process.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.740]   It takes a very long time.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:17.800]   So what he's saying is really that the old man is undergoing this process of crucifixion.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   Paul didn't say that.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.640]   Paul used the aorist.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.880]   He said it has happened to him, and it has happened to him once and forever, and he'll
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.560]   emphasize it in verse 10, in that he died, he died unto sin once.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.320]   It isn't a process.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.240]   Crucifixion has ended it.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.840]   Christ doesn't go on dying.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.720]   He died, he was crucified, and he died once and for all.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.040]   And the crucifixion here points to the death that he accomplished, and I died with him.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.360]   That old man died.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:56.120]   My Adamic nature, the man that I was by my natural birth, that man that was joined and
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:03.320]   united to Adam, he, that's the old man, was crucified together with Christ.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.000]   Now, I say it's important we should be clear about this.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.040]   Because of other statements which the apostle makes, such as this, in Ephesians 4, verses
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   24, 25, and verses 23, well, indeed, I must go even back to 22, verses 22 to 24.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:32.960]   He says that he put off concerning the former conversation, the old man which is corrupt
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:39.320]   according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that he put
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:46.720]   on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:53.600]   And then you can read something similar in Colossians 3, third chapter, verses 9 and
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   10.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:01.120]   "Lie not one to another, seeing that he hath put off the old man with his deeds, and hath
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:07.960]   put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him."
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:17.360]   Now, then, and indeed there is one more, Galatians 5, 24, which reads like this, "And they that
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:28.200]   are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.280]   Those verses seem surely to teach this quite plainly.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:42.120]   I myself am commended to put off the old nature.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:48.640]   It is stated specifically there in Galatians 5, 24, "They that are Christ's, they have
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.640]   crucified."
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.920]   It hasn't been done for them.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:58.600]   They themselves have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:05.720]   But here we are told that the old man has not crucified himself, but that he was crucified.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:13.360]   He was crucified together with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.840]   In other words, the only way you can reconcile these statements is to say this, as I have
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:26.360]   already been trying to say it, that the old man is my old man that I was in Christ, my
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:35.280]   old humanity, that man that was born under the law, born in sin, born under condemnation,
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:41.040]   that sinned with Adam and therefore reaps all the consequences of Adam's sin, that man
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:48.880]   who is under the wrath of God and under the condemnation of God, that man died with Christ,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.440]   was crucified with him.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.040]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   Why?
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.480]   Because I am no longer that man.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.920]   I am the new man in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:09.120]   That old man of mine—not my old nature, my old man, my old humanity—was crucified
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.600]   and died there.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.760]   I am a new man in a new humanity.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.360]   He is the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:21.640]   He is the head of a new race, and I am in this new race.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.800]   And if you realize that that is what the old man means, you then understand that when he
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.200]   says, "Put off the old man," he means this.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   Put off the characteristics of the life of that old man.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.320]   It cannot mean anything else.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.480]   I cannot be told to put off something that has already been crucified.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   No.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.040]   But he has got to use terms, and it is a difficult matter to convey.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   What he is saying is this.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:57.080]   Don't go on living as if you still were that old man, because that old man has died.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.200]   Don't go on living as if you were still that.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   Put that off.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.960]   That is what he means by putting off the old man and putting on the new man.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.320]   Indeed, those who attend here on Sunday mornings will remember that when we were expounding
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:15.600]   that very passage back last May and June, I put it like this, that there in Ephesians
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.360]   24, 22 to 24, the apostle was saying this, "Be what you are."
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.560]   You are no longer the old man, well, don't live like an old man.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.360]   You are a new man, well, live like the new man.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.760]   Be what you are.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.520]   I use this illustration.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.120]   You see a man grown to full age and maturity.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.040]   You see him almost in cures.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.160]   He is afraid of somebody or afraid of something.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.600]   And what do you say to him?
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.840]   You say, "Don't be a baby."
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.440]   Why do you say to him, "Don't be a baby"?
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.160]   Well, it's because he isn't a baby.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.360]   You say to him, "Be a man, because you are a man."
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.440]   "Don't be a baby," you say, "because you're not a baby.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.440]   You cease to be a baby.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.280]   You're now a man, so be a man.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.080]   Be what you are, and don't be something that you're not."
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.140]   There you have the reconciliation of the two things.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:12.400]   And you notice that in Galatians 5, 24, he says quite clearly that it is you and I that
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.880]   have to crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.640]   That has not been crucified for us.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.680]   It's the old man that's been crucified.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:29.920]   And the old man means that old humanity, that man that I was in Adam.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   Now I again have to appeal to you to do this.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.120]   Hold on to the objective character of this statement.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.480]   It is not experimental.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.960]   That's coming later.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.300]   This is not experimental at all.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   This is objective.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:51.580]   He is here putting it in a doctrinal form so that on the basis of that he'll be able
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:57.760]   to make his appeal when he comes to verse 11, 12, 13, and then all the way from 15 to
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.400]   the end of the chapter.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.320]   We must hold on to the objective character of this.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:11.680]   The old man is the man that I was in Adam, and that is the man that has died once and
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   forever.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:25.280]   Now then, this is to me one of the most comforting and assuring and glorious aspects of our faith.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   We are never called upon to crucify our old men.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   And why?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.000]   Well, because it's already happened.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.380]   The old man was crucified in Christ on the cross.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:49.340]   Nowhere does the scripture call upon you to crucify your old men.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.340]   Nowhere does the scripture tell you to get rid of your old men for the obvious reason
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.600]   that he's already gone.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.220]   And you're just allowing the devil to fool you and to delude you.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:06.560]   What you and I are called upon to do is not to go on living as if he were still there,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.280]   which is a very different thing.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.760]   He is not there.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:16.840]   Now the only way to stop living as if he were still there is to realize that he isn't there.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.520]   Are you following that?
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.720]   That is the New Testament method of sanctification.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:27.760]   The whole trouble with us, says the New Testament, is that we don't realize who and what we are.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.560]   We still go on thinking we're the old men, and we're trying to do things to the old men.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   It's been done.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.000]   The old man was crucified with Christ.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.840]   He's nonexistent.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.500]   He's not there.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.540]   The man that you were in, Adam, if you were a Christian, has gone out of being.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.720]   He's out of existence.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   He has no reality at all.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   You are in Christ.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.400]   Do you know, my friends, if we can only see this as we should, we begin really to live
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.680]   as Christians in this world.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.360]   We'd all hold up our heads.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.640]   We'd be able to defy sin and Satan.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.560]   We'd rejoice in Christ Jesus, if we only saw it.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   And yet Paul says we ought all to know this, knowing this.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.720]   Now let us never again try to get rid of the old man.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.920]   He's gone.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:30.680]   This is something I say that we are to believe and to receive by faith.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.620]   This isn't something you experience.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.600]   This is something you believe.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.240]   And it is only as you believe it that your experience will be affected.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.560]   Let me use an analogy and an illustration.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:50.760]   With regard to this truth, we are called upon once more to do what the Father of the faith
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.720]   did, Abraham.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.600]   You remember how we are told all about it there in the fourth chapter, where he puts
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   it like this.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.880]   "Therefore it is by faith that it might be by grace.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.440]   To the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.560]   law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.880]   As it is written, 'I have made thee a father of many nations.'
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:22.120]   Before him whom he believed, even God, who quickneth the dead and calleth those things
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.800]   which be not as though they were."
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   What does he mean?
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   He means this.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.720]   "Who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations, according
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.080]   to that which was spoken, 'So shall thy seed be.'
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.360]   And being not weak in faith, even when he considered his own body now dead when he was
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:50.040]   about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb, he did not stagger at the
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:56.840]   promise of God through unbelief, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God, and
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.320]   being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform."
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.920]   That is what you and I have got to do.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.160]   God made this statement to Abraham, and Abraham did not say, "Now look here, I am nearly
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:19.120]   a hundred years old, and Sarah is over ninety, and the thing is therefore impossible."
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.760]   No, he did not stagger.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.600]   He believed it.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.120]   He saw all the difficulties.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.000]   He did not feel anything at all.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.840]   He had nothing experimental.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.920]   There was Abraham standing under the stars, as the apostle reminds us there.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.440]   He was standing there with God under the stars, and God said, "Look at them.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.440]   Can you count them?
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.800]   So shall thy seed be.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.840]   Can you count this sand on the sea shore?
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.680]   So shall thy seed be."
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.800]   To a man aged ninety-nine with a wife of over ninety.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.960]   Abraham felt nothing at all.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   How could he?
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.040]   There was nothing experimental about it.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.560]   It was just a statement made by God.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.920]   This is what is going to happen, I am telling you.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:07.080]   And Abraham, on the bare word of God, believed.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.520]   And you and I have to do the same.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.760]   I would not know that I was in Adam if God did not tell me in his word.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:21.080]   I would not know that I have been baptized into Christ unless he told me.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.440]   This is an action of the Holy Spirit, which is non-experimental.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.600]   The Holy Spirit baptizes me into Christ.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.200]   It is not the baptism of the Spirit, it is the baptism by the Spirit.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.960]   He baptizes me into union with Christ.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.840]   I know that because I find it in this word.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.480]   And I know that I have died to sin because the word tells me.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.920]   It is not experimental at this stage at all.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.840]   It is the bare statement of God.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.680]   And I must believe it as Abraham believed that word.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.240]   I may feel that I am a sinner, that sin is in me.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.840]   All right, perfectly true.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:04.440]   But on the bare word of God, I believe this, that I died with Christ.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.840]   I am no longer in Adam.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:14.520]   There is therefore no condemnation to me because I am in Christ.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:20.960]   Whatever my feelings may be, whatever the devil may suggest to me as he does, whatever
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:27.400]   the facts that may be flying in the face of the statement, faith sees the promise and
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.520]   holds on to it and believes it.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.240]   And as it does so, it is given experiences.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.800]   Not this, you cannot experience this, you believe this, then you will have other proofs
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.760]   that it is true.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:50.040]   But at this stage, we regard the whole thing objectively and we take it on the bare word
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   of God.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.400]   That is what the apostle is concerned about here, that if we have been planted together
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.800]   in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.280]   Let hell say no, let everything within you and without say no, it does not matter.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.320]   Stand on the foundation of God.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.760]   Plant your feet on this great and glorious promise.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.840]   It is true.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.920]   This is the whole essence of the faith position.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.160]   So I am not taking an experience by faith.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:33.000]   I am taking and believing by faith what God tells me he has done, that he has put me into
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Christ.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.840]   And because I am in Christ, I have died with him, I have risen with him, I am walking in
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.440]   newness of life with him.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.400]   Now then, there in that last phrase you get a hint at experience.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.200]   I am aware of that, that I am walking in a new life.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.160]   I can give you proofs of new life within me.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.960]   But at this point, that is not the thing.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.920]   The thing that I must hold on to is that I have been put into Christ, and that therefore
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.640]   these things are true of me.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:10.520]   And you see, it is because of this that my salvation is so sure.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.780]   It is because God himself by the Spirit has put me into Christ, that nothing can ever
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.280]   take me out of Christ.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:26.120]   My future, eternal future, my final glorification is guaranteed and certain and sure.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:34.280]   Whom he called them he also justified, and whom he justified them he hath also glorified.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.720]   Very well, we must leave it at that for this evening.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.000]   And now we can go on and work out what the apostle goes on to show us was the object
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   in all this.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.840]   And the whole time he is answering the false objection which he has mentioned in verse
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   one.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.800]   I do trust that we are keeping the big argument in our minds.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:02.160]   He is showing the utter nonsensical character of this suggestion, that we should continue
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.080]   in sin that grace may abound.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:10.920]   Why, he says, the whole object of all that Christ has done in his grace is to deliver
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:19.160]   us finally and completely out of that, into this new life which is his own life, which
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.720]   is indeed the life of God.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.200]   Let us pray.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.120]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
