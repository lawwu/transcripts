[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Here's an email from a pastor who writes in to ask about one of those tricky pastoral
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.680]   dilemmas that pop up from time to time.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.960]   He asks this, "Is it appropriate for pastors to hug female members of his church, and single
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.200]   women in particular?
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.780]   What does appropriate pastoral affection towards the opposite sex look like for a pastor?"
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.100]   Good pastoral question, or any Christian question, I suppose.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.040]   And let me start with three Bible pointers, and then I'll talk from my own experience
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.440]   what I've learned.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.840]   Number one, the Bible speaks of a holy kiss, from which I infer at least this, there is
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.760]   such a thing as a holy hug.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.320]   Second, the Bible also says treat younger women as sisters, older women as mothers.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.600]   In other words, the atmosphere of the church should be a safe family place for healthy,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.440]   wholesome family affection.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   Number three, the Bible says, "To the pure, all things are pure," which means that we
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.880]   need to know ourselves.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:30.180]   If our thoughts are impure, and our hearts are impure, then a hug may be impure.
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.920]   So the issue is a deep heart issue, and we need to be doing work there before we start
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.320]   getting strategies in our head about doing the right kind of hugging.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.040]   Okay, on the basis of those three, and from my experience, here's what I've learned.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.640]   I've hugged, goodnight, what, thousands, hundreds of women, most of them right in front of the
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.880]   church after a service or after a speaking event.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.840]   I mean, lots of women with tears in their eyes, having been transformed by something
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.360]   I wrote, say, "Can I just hug you?
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.520]   What are you going to say?"
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.700]   And I have talked to a lot of women and a lot of men about the experience of being hugged.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.040]   And here's some things I've learned to take into consideration.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.560]   Number one, there are lonely people in the church who don't have a spouse.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.200]   They don't have many friends that are close.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.320]   One woman told me, she said, "There are women in this church who have not been hugged by
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   a human being for 10 years, and they need to be hugged in a holy way by a holy, mature
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   man, simply to feel fully loved in a holy way."
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.020]   I think that's right.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.080]   We are family, and families have bodies, and bodies are not just sex instruments.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   That's important.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   And it's probably more true for women than for men, but it's true for men too.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.200]   It ought to be anyway.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.180]   Bodies are not just sex instruments.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.860]   They are instruments of trust, instruments of affirmation, instruments of holy affection.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.300]   That's number one.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.860]   Number two, all of us should grow in our ability to discern what the other person needs and
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.020]   wants and is accustomed to.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.180]   Don't force your way of hugging on others when they are uncomfortable with it.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.760]   That is a very delicate balancing act as you meet a person for the first time.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.040]   This calls for extraordinary discernment, right?
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.480]   In split seconds, you're making a judgment call here.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:59.280]   In general, I would not, not take the initiative to hug a woman who's not taking that initiative
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   with me unless there were significant relational precedents that established that's what we
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.760]   do when we meet.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.560]   And there's a kind of mutuality understanding of what it means.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.200]   So there may be a long friend that you haven't seen for ages, and when you see each other,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.560]   you don't need to ask, "I wonder if a hug would be appropriate here."
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.960]   Well, it's a given.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.560]   Because you know her, you know, you got a long history together.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.640]   In general, though, I would say let the woman signal that a hug would be appropriate or
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.720]   welcome.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.200]   Number three, adapt to the kind of hug being offered.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.400]   Now, this too is a gift of sensitivity.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.960]   There are all kinds of hugs, right?
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.240]   Face hugs, lean over hugs, one arm hugs, two arm hugs, minimal contact hugs, lots of contact
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.520]   hugs.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.320]   Let the woman set this.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.800]   Don't ever communicate as a man any kind of aggression or any kind of sexual attraction
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.600]   unless she's your wife.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.640]   Number four, learn quickly from the kind of hug that just happened what's going on.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:27.600]   I have sometimes gotten hugs that felt to me very inappropriate.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   Learn from that and put your guard up and don't go there again.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.200]   She comes to see you, don't go there.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   Don't go there.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.680]   Don't give her the opportunity for that kind of hug.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.120]   Now that's a delicate judgment because maybe she didn't mean that, but we've got to learn
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   how to discern.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.480]   Don't welcome it, avoid it.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.160]   Number five, take the setting into account.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.600]   I'm always more at ease hugging another woman when my wife is present.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.720]   In private, say she comes to see you in your office, you leave the door open or there's
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.260]   a window.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:11.200]   In private, I'm very wary about putting myself in a position of hugging and I wouldn't offer
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   it.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   I wouldn't offer it.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.320]   She may ask for it and you may grant it, but you would be very wary and very careful about
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.600]   the setting and you would minimize privacy in those settings of counsel.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.520]   The last thing I would say is don't be so stiff and so wary and so cautious that you
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.320]   can't hug.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.160]   There are cultures and there are persons who feel treated badly without a hug.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.800]   If you let your principles or your prickliness hold you back in those settings, you're not
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.020]   as free as you should be.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:58.240]   We should speak other body languages sometimes besides our own for the good of another culture
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.980]   or another personality.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:08.240]   So all in all, I would say this, establish a principled and emotionally healthy and happy
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:16.920]   place at your church where people feel safe, especially women, safe to hug or not to hug.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.400]   You may remember the practice of hugs actually emerged in an unlikely episode, episode number
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.000]   124, which we titled Mealtime Prayers, Necessary or Optional?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.740]   In there, Pastor John, you develop this point about how habits of the body nourish habits
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.840]   of the soul, even when the physical acts feel forced in the moment.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   It's worth checking out.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.240]   That's episode number 124.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.480]   Well tomorrow is Christmas Eve and next time on the podcast, Pastor John and I will be
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.720]   joined by Noel Piper to explain what Christmas looked like in the Piper home for the last
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.720]   40 plus years.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.360]   Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
