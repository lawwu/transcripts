[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   insight, skills, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.720]   Today on the show we tackle a thorny financial planning problem.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.520]   This week I was working with a consulting client of mine, someone that I have worked
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.400]   with here and there over the years, and this particular client is a very young man.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.880]   He is financially competent and he was unexpectedly diagnosed with a very significant and serious
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.520]   form of cancer in his middle 20s.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.080]   He originally wrote to me after his initial diagnosis and said that he wished that he
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.920]   had taken my advice to buy more disability income insurance, but that he thought it really
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.720]   would never relate to him, so he had chosen not to.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.880]   So I tell that to you, if you have heard me give advice or if there's something in your
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.200]   personal financial plan that you know you should do, as in buy disability insurance,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.880]   buy life insurance, get it done, because this particular young man was diagnosed with this
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.320]   serious and aggressive form of cancer in his early 20s.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.960]   For the last few years he has battled the cancer and at present the prognosis is good.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.440]   The cancer has gone into remission and he has recently married his long-time girlfriend
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.880]   who was with him through the medical trial they have recently married and are now building
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.440]   their life together as a married couple.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.200]   But of course this particular type of health diagnosis and this particular type of health
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.100]   history changes the normal tone of a relationship a little bit.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.320]   It brings mortality much more quickly into view, causes a more intense seriousness, and
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   brings with it a couple of challenging circumstances for financial planning.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.320]   If you've ever personally experienced an ongoing health problem or you've ever worked with
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.240]   somebody, you know how important good insurance is to somebody in that circumstance.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.040]   There are many people who have severe medical conditions and the only reason they work is
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.360]   to maintain a good, solid, low-cost health insurance plan.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.400]   There are many people who have severe health histories, and when that happens, the existing
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.680]   insurance portfolio, life insurance, disability income insurance, and health insurance, really
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.400]   make a big difference.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.320]   Now thankfully my friend and client is doing better now, so I'm very pleased for that.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.160]   But we spent some time working to say, "How do you plan for your wife as a husband?
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.080]   How do you plan for your wife and potentially children in the future when you can't get
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.840]   life insurance?"
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.160]   And this is something I've thought a lot about and I thought it would be interesting for
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.600]   me to share with you the advice that I gave to him.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.480]   Now I hope that you'll listen to this with two things in mind.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.400]   One is of course, well three things.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.440]   One, get life insurance.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.240]   Life insurance is the simplest and easiest way to do it.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.560]   An average healthy 20 or 30-year-old man or woman could get a million dollars of term
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.640]   life insurance for under 50 bucks a month, anywhere from 30, 40, 50 bucks a month.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   It's simple and it's inexpensive.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.500]   Get life insurance.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.160]   And also take my advice on life insurance seriously.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.600]   When I talk about why I shy away from things like 10-year level term insurance in favor
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.560]   of other approaches, it's stories like this.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   As a financial planner, it's really frustrating to know of a circumstance where good planning
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.140]   that allowed options in the future would have made the difference.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.180]   And that's why so much advice, especially around life insurance, is short-sighted.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.700]   It assumes things don't change.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   The weird thing about, just like if you work as a firefighter, you see a lot of people
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.540]   broken, a lot of dead bodies and hurt bodies because people don't wear their seatbelts.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.420]   And so you probably are an advocate for seatbelts and airbags in cars and safe driving.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.900]   If you're a police officer, you encounter so much violence on a regular basis that you
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.700]   become an advocate for people to prepare themselves against violence.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.620]   And the same thing as a financial planner.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.740]   If you've worked as a financial planner, as I have, you become an advocate for recognizing
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.420]   that life will change.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.560]   And so these small probability events, like a healthy mid-20s male getting a serious and
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.540]   aggressive form of cancer and almost dying, these small probability events take on much
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.060]   more significance.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.900]   And it changes you.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.060]   It has changed me as a financial planner.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.460]   I don't deny the unlikely probability, but here's the problem with probabilities.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.100]   Although something may be statistically unlikely, as measured of percentage, number of people
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.940]   affected per 100,000, very statistically unlikely, but if it happens to you, it's devastating.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.580]   So many people can go through their lives never having life insurance, never having
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.600]   homeowner's insurance, never having car insurance.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.740]   Many people can go through their lives and never have a problem.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.220]   But if it happens to you, it's devastating.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.620]   That's the whole problem with insurance.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.740]   So one is I encourage you to think carefully and properly insure yourself now while you
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.180]   don't need it.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.880]   You may be glad you do.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.220]   And even in this particular case, this young man didn't have parents, or sorry, he had
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.060]   parents, but wasn't married at the time.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.980]   He had a girlfriend, I think, when he originally had his initial cancer diagnosis.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.760]   But people ask me, "Joshua, why do you recommend to single people they get life insurance?
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   They don't need it."
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.000]   No, technically, I agree, you don't need it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   But I tell you what, when you have been living with your parents, fighting cancer for a few
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.340]   years and they've been paying your bills, taking you places to treatments, when you've
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.880]   been with your girlfriend and she's been sticking by you in difficult times, and then if you
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.080]   knew you were going to die, it may help you to feel a little bit better to be able to
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.440]   just take out your half a million or million dollar term life insurance policy and make
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.720]   sure that that beneficiary designation is sending some money to your parents and to
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   your girlfriend.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   No, it's not technically necessary because they're not reliant upon you for your income.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   Technically, that's true.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   I admit that.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.020]   I concede the point.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.560]   But I just put myself in that situation and I would feel a lot better.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.480]   And if I knew that my parents were going to go through grief of my dying because I had
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.520]   cancer, and I knew they had incurred heavy financial costs and lifestyle costs from their
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.700]   multi-year care for me, and then if I knew I were headed for death, I would feel better
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.320]   about at least knowing that when I die, a couple hundred thousand dollars will help
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.720]   them to be able to perhaps take a little time to grieve for me and yet not to feel financial
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.920]   pressure and to repay them in some small way for some of the financial costs that they
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   have incurred.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.240]   So life insurance is very, very useful, and it's why I'm such a steady advocate of life
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.680]   insurance.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.720]   It's just so helpful.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.960]   So that's one thing to listen to.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.620]   But also, listen in the context of today's show, listen for both this particular unique
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.760]   creative approach to how do you plan when you can't get life insurance, but also think
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.240]   about financial independence and financial freedom.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.600]   Because many of the things that I'm going to describe to you in this show are basically
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.160]   the same things that you do for financial independence and financial freedom.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.560]   In essence, we're trying to solve the same problem here.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.680]   We're trying to say, "How do I make sure that somebody's able to continue on when I die,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.680]   but knowing that I can't leave money behind?"
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.560]   So that's the problem that we're going to solve.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.620]   So first, for anybody who is in this situation, if you can't get life insurance, the first
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.440]   thing you need to know is it may actually be possible for you to get it if you shop
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.960]   hard enough.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:12.940]   And here I would refer you back to episode 204 of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.520]   That episode was titled, "A Behind-the-Scenes Look into High-Risk Life Insurance Underwriting."
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.960]   It was an interview with a friend of mine named Todd Simpson, who specializes in high-risk
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   life insurance.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.480]   Let's go back and listen to episode 204, because sometimes what one agent may not be able to
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.960]   get done, another agent may be able to get done.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.920]   There are hundreds of life insurance companies that are all competing for business.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.320]   And there are some companies who may not want your business because of your personal medical
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   profile, but there are other companies that may want your business.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.080]   Now generally with cancer, if somebody has had a recent cancer diagnosis, the answer
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080]   is no.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.520]   The company will take that.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.120]   At least for about five years is the industry standard.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.760]   What life insurance companies get very concerned about is being confronted with medical change.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.360]   They don't like change, because change is hard to predict.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.080]   So they don't like somebody who's recently had a health condition diagnosed, and they
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.840]   don't like somebody who's recently been cleared of a previous medical diagnosis.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.760]   They want time, because time brings stability to the diagnosis.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.160]   So with cancer, if you have survived a cancer diagnosis, frequently you may be able to go
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.080]   ahead and get a policy, but usually it'll be at least about five years after your diagnosis.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.720]   But reach out to multiple life insurance agents.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.920]   Try to reach with somebody who specializes in high-risk life insurance cases and who
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.440]   has personal expertise.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.000]   So if you have diabetes, if you have heart disease, if you have a cancer history, if
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.800]   you have some other medical condition, and if you need life insurance, then remember
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.040]   to go and just work hard and work with multiple agents.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.560]   It's worth the search.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.780]   Don't just go to some website.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.920]   Go to an agent and do your best to get life insurance.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.640]   You may be able to do it.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.160]   The next suggestion for you is go ahead and try to get insurance when there is no medical
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.960]   underwriting required.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.540]   Now here's where you get the value of a group insurance contract.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:19.400]   With many companies, many companies provide as a package of their benefits a group life
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.000]   insurance contract.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.760]   And frequently a group life insurance contract will either be issued with no medical underwriting
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.940]   or simplified medical underwriting.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.600]   The norm here is one-time salary.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.120]   But depending on the business that you work in or the company that you work with, there
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.720]   may be a larger number.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.360]   I've worked with a number of clients over the years who have very high amounts of group
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.620]   life insurance as a component of that firm's benefits.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:53.800]   So you should look for any kind of life insurance that you can get without medical underwriting.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.720]   Don't despise it even if it's a relatively small amount.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.900]   You might like to have a million or two million dollars of life insurance, but you might only
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.040]   be able to get $50,000 of life insurance.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:13.160]   But $50,000 goes a long way towards giving your spouse a few months to recover, towards
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.600]   wrapping up some medical bills, towards getting some breathing room, etc.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.400]   So don't despise a small amount.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.980]   Also remember that group contracts can be changed.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.960]   So if you have a position of influence and you would like to change the group contract,
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.360]   you could always try to work with somebody to see if they could enhance the group contract.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.200]   The chances of that happening are low, but you might be in a position where that could
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.280]   happen and a reworking of group benefits could qualify you for an additional amount of insurance.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.640]   And don't despise small bits of life insurance.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:52.880]   You may be able to join an organization or an association, and frequently an organization
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:01.840]   or association would entitle you to be able to get a small amount of life insurance, and
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.480]   that could be very helpful for you.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.000]   So obviously try to get life insurance and try to get it in any way that you possibly
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.680]   can, even if it's in small amounts.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.000]   If you have $0 of life insurance and you can put together a $10,000 policy that was guaranteed
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.680]   issue, no underwriting, it's a little bit expensive, but that covers you, and then $25,000
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:29.400]   from joining some organization that was marketing to you, and then a one or two-time salary
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:35.240]   at work, you may be able to put together enough life insurance to be meaningful for your family.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:44.320]   Next, before we get into the creative approaches that don't involve financial products, let's
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:51.120]   talk about some unique financial products that might help you and are worth your paying
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.040]   attention to.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.440]   So let's start with other insurance programs.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.080]   Life insurance, if you think about what it's designed to fund, there are a number of things
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.700]   that it's designed to fund.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.960]   One is debt.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.560]   One is paying off debt for a surviving spouse.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.640]   Another would be providing income for an ongoing period for a surviving spouse, and another
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.040]   example of what it would fund is taking care of things like medical bills.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.840]   Frequently somebody will acquire medical bills towards the end of their life, and so life
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.600]   insurance can be helpful to pay off some of those medical bills.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.680]   But if you think about that, you may be able to substitute an alternative insurance product
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.040]   that would help with that.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.640]   Here's where you get the value of a strong health insurance contract.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.120]   So you may not be able to get life insurance, but can you make sure that your health insurance
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.280]   contract is the strongest you could possibly get, or a disability insurance contract is
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.160]   the strongest that you could get?
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.720]   If you think about a health diagnosis like cancer, somebody who has a severe form of
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.920]   cancer, they are weakened by their cancer treatment, they're unable to work.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.200]   If somebody has good disability income insurance during that period of time, they can at least
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.380]   have an income, and that income can go to help their family.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.440]   So don't be scared if you're in a situation like this.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:13.320]   Don't be scared to change jobs or change companies just based upon the overall package of benefits,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   the overall package of a strong group long-term disability insurance contract that doesn't
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.960]   require personal underwriting and medical qualification, or a strong health insurance
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.720]   contract that will result in relatively low out-of-pocket costs for you.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:36.000]   Those types of products can help to minimize the potential for you to have large medical
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.840]   expenses.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.640]   The next type of financial product to consider is something that has a death benefit, and
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.360]   that death benefit is not individually underwritten.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.520]   The most obvious example here is something like the value of an annuity contract.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   One of the recommendations that I made to my client was that he consider transitioning
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.120]   some of his investment dollars out of traditional mutual funds and into an annuity contract.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.560]   Let me explain to you why.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.900]   There are various kinds of annuities.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:14.160]   In essence, an annuity contract is an insurance contract issued by an insurance company that
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.800]   is designed to function as the opposite of life insurance.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.360]   A life insurance contract is a financial product that's designed to pay out a sum of money
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.520]   at death.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.920]   You make premium payments into the contract, and then at death that contract pays out a
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.600]   large lump sum of money to a survivor.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.040]   An annuity contract is, in its most traditional sense, designed to take a large amount of
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.400]   money as a lump sum and then to pay it out for somebody's entire lifetime.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.360]   A traditional annuity contract, something that would go under the classification of
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.480]   what's called a single premium immediate annuity, would be a way for you to say, "Here, Mr.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.440]   Insurance Company, I have $500,000.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.560]   Will you please take my $500,000 from me and in exchange guarantee me a monthly payment
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:10.360]   of $4,000 per month every month for the rest of my life?" or some variation of that.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.640]   That is a traditional annuity contract.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   However, that basic concept has been expanded into dozens and dozens of flavors of annuities.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:29.200]   That traditional single premium immediate annuity can be affected in a number of ways.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.400]   The two ways that are important in this context are these.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:41.200]   First, you can change a single premium immediate annuity into a deferred annuity.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:47.920]   A deferred annuity is a contract with a life insurance company wherein you can systematically
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.040]   either put in monthly payments or you can transfer in a lump sum, and then you can defer
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.540]   the receiving of money from that contract to the future.
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.500]   That's why it's called a deferred annuity.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.440]   That can be very helpful.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.840]   The second reason it can be helpful is in this way.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.920]   You can take an annuity contract and you can choose to have it either be what's called
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.840]   a fixed annuity, which is a guaranteed fixed rate of interest that's guaranteed by the
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.040]   insurance company, or you can have what's called a variable annuity.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:30.120]   A variable annuity is an investment product that features an underlying investment account
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:36.840]   or group of accounts, and that performance of that underlying account or group of accounts
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.280]   creates within the context of the annuity contract an underlying investment return.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.460]   In the world of annuities, these are called variable subaccounts.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.440]   They function in basic equivalence to a mutual fund.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.760]   A mutual fund in the open marketplace just simply is taken and brought under the wrapper
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.280]   of the insurance contract, and it's called a variable subaccount.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.520]   Frequently, if you're working with a large annuity provider, you would have the ability
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:11.920]   to purchase shares in exactly the same internal account.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:20.160]   The big mutual company growth and income fund could be labeled publicly and privately.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.040]   You'll frequently see if you look at an insurance company, you look at their subaccounts, you'll
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:31.120]   see the names of the management companies, and you'll also see the specific products
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   listed.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.200]   So it allows you to own mutual funds inside of an annuity contract.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.460]   Now sometimes, this is a bad idea, frequently these types of variable annuities get a bad
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.500]   wrap in the personal finance space because they're more expensive.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.800]   The reason they're more expensive is because an annuity contract adds an additional insurance
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:58.880]   charge onto the underlying investment fund expenses of the subaccount.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   If you think about the structure of an annuity contract, and you think about the fees that
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.600]   are paid, the first problem you have is the fees of the underlying subaccounts.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:18.260]   If you have a fidelity fund that is in your annuity contract, and you have a fidelity
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.240]   fund that you're purchasing as an open-end mutual fund in the public market, you still
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.300]   in both of those cases have investment expenses.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.840]   You have all of the fees for administrative costs, all of the fees that are paid to the
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.120]   investment managers, et cetera.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.040]   And so those fees are going to be identical in your public open-end mutual fund that you
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.680]   purchase in the public market versus your individual subaccount that you can fund your
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.280]   variable annuity contract with.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.400]   Those fees are going to be the same.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.440]   And because frequently the funds that are in a subaccount are actively managed funds,
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   those fees are high, just like all actively managed mutual funds are.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:03.120]   But the second set of fees that get placed onto a variable annuity contract are what's
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.480]   called mortality and expense charges.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.360]   And these fees can range from very small to very large, depending on the individual feature
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.980]   of the contract that is being offered.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.960]   So some fees are simple and normal.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.460]   We're just going to charge a small mortality and expense charge because we're an insurance
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.520]   company and we're going to make you this promise in the future.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.680]   But then inside a variable annuity contract, sometimes you can add on additional enhanced
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.760]   benefits.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.700]   The most meaningful in the context here of our financial planning scenario is what's
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:40.280]   called a guaranteed death benefit or some form of enhanced guaranteed death benefit.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.200]   So the way it works is essentially this.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.120]   Let's pretend that my client had $100,000 in a mutual fund.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.000]   Well, he may be concerned about keeping that money in a mutual fund if he's concerned about
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.600]   providing that money for his wife.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.000]   And in that context, here's the danger.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.440]   If he keeps the money of $100,000 in the mutual fund and then he gets cancer, what happens
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.920]   if the market has declined by 30% when he gets cancer and has declined from $100,000
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   of value to $70,000 of value?
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.560]   That could be very problematic because if he dies of cancer and his wife needs the money
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.940]   or if he needs to access it for his own expenses, he just can't afford to take the risk.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.040]   And if he can't afford to take the risk, then he can't afford really in the long run to
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.340]   get the return.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.320]   So how does he keep the money invested?
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.820]   It would be unwise for him to have all this money invested if he thought he were going
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.680]   to die relatively soon.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.600]   But a death benefit and annuity contract can elegantly solve this problem.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.320]   There are a number of different approaches to death benefits, and I'm going to give you
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.840]   just two very simple ones that are relatively inexpensive, and there are other annuity contracts
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.400]   that charge more for fancier death benefits.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   There's a whole line of annuity products that have a ratcheting death benefit that's beyond
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.660]   the scope of what I want to talk about today.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.400]   But one form of death benefit is just a guaranteed return of the amount of money put into the
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   contract.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:11.280]   So in this case, if you put $100,000 into the contract and then the value of the underlying
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.160]   subaccounts in the contract decline because the stock market is declining, let's say the
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:22.000]   value declines from $100,000 to $70,000, and then you die, the insurance company will pay
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.040]   out your initial contribution of $100,000 to your beneficiaries.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:34.820]   That can help you to keep your investments invested aggressively because you can know
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.220]   that at least you'll always get the return of the money that you've put in.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.080]   That's the cheapest death benefit, and that's basically a standard option on almost all
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.480]   variable annuity contracts, at least that I have ever seen personally and studied the
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.420]   paperwork for.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.060]   There are other benefits.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.980]   One example of another type of death benefit that you can purchase is a small, what's called
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.000]   a ratcheting death benefit.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.260]   The way that works is you have a death benefit on the contract that always goes up, and it
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.300]   always goes up at something like your policy anniversary.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:16.060]   So in this example, if you invest $100,000 into the contract, and then a year from now
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:22.660]   that contract has grown to be $120,000, and then four years from now that contract has
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:29.740]   grown to be $150,000, each year on the policy anniversary, whatever the contract value of
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.700]   the account is, that becomes your new death benefit.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:40.300]   Now after your new death benefit has reached $150,000, perhaps there is a recession and
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.420]   the value of your underlying investments decreases.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.580]   You go from $150,000 to $100,000.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.000]   The death benefit doesn't ratchet down, it only ratchets up.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.120]   So you know that that $150,000 will always be available as a death benefit for your beneficiary.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:03.980]   Even if the market is down for three or four years, at least you have that death benefit.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.980]   That's the type of product that can be really helpful to somebody in this situation, because
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:15.340]   it solves the problem of allowing you to invest for the long term, allowing you to invest
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:20.900]   in potentially volatile assets like stocks, but to also make sure that you have a death
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.160]   benefit.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:29.040]   And that can be a substantial benefit for someone in this circumstance, especially if
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.320]   they are someone who has a shortened lifespan.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.640]   This may even help to engage in a little bit of adverse selection against the insurance
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.120]   company, because if you purchase a contract with this type of death benefit, then you
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:53.620]   personally have an incentive to perhaps consider investing the money as aggressively as possible.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.640]   After all, if you're not going to use the cash while you're alive, you don't think,
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.600]   or you think it's possible that you might not use the cash while you're alive, then
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:09.840]   why not go ahead and invest in an aggressive portfolio, trying to aim for the largest growth,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.280]   knowing that if the portfolio declines, at least you have the death benefit, and at least
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.660]   your family will do well.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:21.080]   So that can work for someone in this circumstance.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.680]   That's the best example I can think of as the value of looking at other types of insurance
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:31.480]   products and looking to see, is there a potential death benefit that I can get?
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:37.400]   And so you should seriously consider that if that plays a role in your plans.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:44.480]   If I were in the type of situation that I'm describing, I would move many of my investment
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.900]   dollars out of open-end mutual funds.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.520]   If I had open-end mutual funds, I would move them out of open-end mutual funds, and I would
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.560]   move them into an annuity, variable annuity, with a sub-account in order to get the benefit
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.620]   of that death benefit.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.160]   Many people, it's not a significant benefit, and it can be a significant cost.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.680]   Those additional mortality and expense charges can be significant, but that death benefit
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.400]   can be very valuable in a circumstance like I am describing.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.940]   Now here would be another example of something you should consider.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.840]   This would be appropriate if you were at an older age, not my mid-20s client, but if you
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.080]   were at an older age and you had something like an annuity or you had something like
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:35.880]   a sum of money, you should seriously consider your distribution plan from an annuity.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:46.040]   Now if you are in a severe medical state, there do exist enhanced risk or increased
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:53.960]   risk annuity contracts, which are actually, the annuity payout is actually medically underwritten.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.120]   Usually if you have a sum of money and you're trying to get a sum of money out of an annuity
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.360]   contract, usually there's no medical test for that.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.000]   But there are increased risk products where they'll come and they'll say, "Okay, you
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.100]   have cancer.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.040]   We think you're probably going to die at an early age, so we'll pay you an extra amount
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.880]   of money out of this annuity because of the fact that you have cancer."
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.120]   But in this context, if you knew that you were going to die soon, you would have good
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.840]   financial incentive to carefully consider what annuity payout you're going to choose
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.800]   for the benefit of your spouse.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.680]   And you might choose a benefit that had the highest ongoing benefit for your surviving
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.900]   spouse so that instead of having something that was, for example, an annuity payout plan
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.400]   for you, a single life income only payout.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.480]   That would be unwise because there's a good chance that the insurance company would keep
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.960]   all that money.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.920]   But in the other case, if you were likely to die soon and your spouse were likely to
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:56.560]   not die for a long time, you would be wiser to, say, purchase a life income payout that
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.600]   would be the same amount for you and the same amount for her for the rest of your life.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.680]   So carefully consider the various benefits and think of this in mind.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.360]   Now let's get back out of the weeds of financial products, although hopefully those suggestions
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.320]   are helpful to you.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.800]   Before we get out of the weeds, there are other potential products.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:24.280]   Sometimes you can purchase a, you can consider things like a combo product.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.600]   Sometimes there are life insurance and long-term care combination products.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.480]   Usually those wouldn't work for somebody who's already had a medical diagnosis because of
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.600]   their, they wouldn't be able to qualify either for the long-term care or for the life insurance.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.040]   But if you already have a product, sometimes you may be able to adjust the product that
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   you have in order to fit your needs.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.160]   So now let's get out of the weeds.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:58.320]   The basic plan for finances is, basic plan for how to solve this problem is to try to
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.240]   figure out how to protect your spouse.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   And it depends, there's a big difference here depending on if you are already in a
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.040]   strong situation or if you're not in a strong financial situation.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.920]   The ideal circumstance is you're already financially independent and you should be working towards
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   that.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.040]   Because if you're financially independent and then you die, by definition your spouse
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.840]   will continue to be financially independent.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.960]   So I'm going to describe to you how I would do this if I received a cancer diagnosis and
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.840]   I had an expected lifespan of five to ten years.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.040]   I'm going to explain to you how I would do this.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.920]   First let's pretend that I get this diagnosis and I'm in a very difficult financial situation.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.520]   If you know someone in this situation, I want you to learn this information so that you
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   can go and help them and teach them, possibly refer them to this show so they can at least
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.800]   improve their circumstance the best way possible.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.240]   Let's pretend that I am very financially unhealthy.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.960]   I have a lot of debt, I'm having income problems, we have some assets but not a lot.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.680]   This is common because by the time somebody gets a diagnosis, they frequently are already
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.280]   pretty deep in the hole.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.080]   They frequently are accumulating credit card debt to pay for living expenses while they
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.500]   try to figure out what's wrong with their health situation.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.080]   They're frequently accumulating credit card debt and draining down assets to pay for additional
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.780]   medical costs, co-pays, medications that aren't covered under health insurance, etc.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:30.080]   And so frequently by the time somebody gets a terminal diagnosis, they are in a deep place
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.600]   financially.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.920]   So let me describe what I would do if I were in a situation.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.720]   The first thing that I would try to do is I would try to figure out how I could minimize
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.800]   the burden on my wife, who I would expect to survive me by a long period of time.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.400]   And I would use every trick that I know to try to make sure that she is not liable for
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:59.820]   any debts, if at all possible, and to make sure that she has as much money as possible
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.200]   set aside for her.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.920]   Now you need to be careful in some of these circumstances because you face the risk, if
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:16.760]   you are structuring your transactions, you face the risk of a court coming back and undoing
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   your work.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.680]   An example is this.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.800]   I know I'm going to die next week, and so the last thing I do is go and take a cash
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.360]   advance on my credit card.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.760]   Let's say I have a $50,000 limit and I take out a $40,000 cash advance for my credit card.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:39.400]   I take that money and I give it to my brother, thinking that when I die, that at least he'll
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.160]   have the money and that debt, well, they're never going to collect it.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.520]   That's a pretty big risk.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.520]   That's a pretty significant potential problem.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.360]   And I think there would be a good case for the credit card company to sue your estate
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.840]   and try to claw back that money from your brother.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:00.320]   That's a serious and significant...that would be...I think they would have a good legal
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   case there.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.560]   I'm not aware of any case history, but I think they would have in that circumstance a good
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   legal case.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.760]   However, you can use the same approach yourself in perhaps a more practical way.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.480]   The basic thing I would first look at is I would look at all of our assets and I would
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.720]   try to say, "What is the ownership of our assets?
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.120]   What is the ownership of our house?"
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.440]   If we own a house, are we both on the deed?
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.440]   What's the ownership of our vehicles?
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.240]   What's the ownership of our personal assets?
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.040]   What is the ownership of our accounts?
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.320]   How are our accounts structured, our bank accounts, etc.?
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:47.120]   If all of those things are joint accounts, I would do my best to start a process of transferring
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.160]   assets from joint ownership into my wife's ownership exclusively.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.600]   Again, in my scenario, I'm pretending that I'm going to die.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.960]   I've got a few years of a diagnosis and my wife is going to survive me.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.880]   I would try to transfer all of my assets out of my name and into my wife's name.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:11.160]   As best we can, I would try to make a clear legal distinction in the ownership of assets
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.280]   and I want to move the assets over to her.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:21.480]   I want to do this early, as early as I possibly can, so that we don't run the risk of right
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.960]   at the end trying to make some kind of transfer and then somebody sues us as a fraudulent
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.180]   transaction.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.640]   There is no reason in the world why I can't give my wife everything I own.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.480]   It's not a fraudulent transaction, but in the way that I do it, I should be wise and
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.600]   circumspect in the actual approach that I use.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.320]   So I would work on that.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.060]   I would go so far as to say, if I own something and it's already jointly owned, can I make
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:56.440]   an intelligent trade so that my wife will wind up owning whatever the next thing is?
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.080]   So an example here would be a house.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.320]   In a moment I'll talk about making sure that the house would be financially sustainable
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.440]   for my family after I die.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.320]   But if we own a house together and I can't just quit claiming and get that out of my
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.760]   name, which would be hard because of the way that at least most houses would be owned,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.400]   I would consider selling the house and I would say, can we downsize into a small house, but
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.080]   when we buy the next one, can I make sure that my wife is the one who owns it fully?
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.800]   And then I'm moving things out of my estate.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.720]   The second thing I would try to do is I would try to transfer all of the debt in the house
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   under my name.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.040]   Oh, anything possible, I would transfer liabilities into my name.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:48.640]   When you die, your estate has to stand good and pay your debts.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.820]   But just because that is true doesn't mean you have to have a big, healthy estate of
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.920]   lots of assets to pay lots of debts.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:04.040]   So I want to disconnect, as much as we can figure out how to do, I want to disconnect
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.720]   our asset ownership and move everything that we own into her name and then refinance and
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.440]   move all the debt into my name.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:17.660]   If we have joint credit cards that have balances, I'm going to apply for new credit cards in
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:23.340]   my name and I'm going to use those new credit cards to pay off the balance of the old credit
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.340]   cards.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:29.180]   The goal is that my name is on all the debt and her name is on all the assets.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:38.200]   That will help to make sure that when I die, she's not stuck owing a lot of money.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:44.920]   Additionally what I would do is I would try to make sure that our assets that we do own
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.880]   are held in protected accounts.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.540]   The most important types of accounts here are retirement accounts.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.520]   This sometimes cannot be workable because of the high expenses.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.900]   If you have high expenses to keep yourself going, it may not work.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:07.900]   But I would try to make sure that any money that we have is moved into retirement accounts.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:16.780]   So if, for example, we have $100,000 in the bank and we have $0 in a 401(k), I'm going
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:24.580]   to divert as much of our income into that 401(k) account as possible and minimize the
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.260]   number of money that we have in the bank.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:33.620]   This helps me to move assets from insecure places, as in the bank, into more secured
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:38.260]   places, into my 401(k) accounts, which are protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:44.480]   This will help to protect my wife, especially if I have a significant account balance.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.740]   She will be the beneficiary of that account.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.400]   That account is secure from the claims of creditors.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:55.340]   And even if she owed money, let's say that I weren't able to get all the debt into
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.840]   my name so that it would die with me, even if she owed money, at least the money that's
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.060]   in the 401(k) would be secure from the claims of her creditors.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.540]   And that would help to assure her future retirement.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.440]   She may need to declare bankruptcy after I'm dead.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.700]   She may have to go through that process.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   At least the money that's in those accounts is protected.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:23.020]   A 401(k) account, an IRA account, hopefully in your state, it has that same level of protection.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.100]   These types of accounts are very helpful.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.060]   Also things like annuities.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.800]   If you have them, you can fund annuities.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.780]   That gives you some creditor protection.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.220]   It's not quite as strong as a 401(k), but it's going to do the job.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:43.540]   And fund these accounts and move the assets as much as you can out beyond the reach of
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.280]   your creditors.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:52.540]   In addition, make sure that you minimize the ownership of money that's in accounts.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.220]   So move money out of the bank, move it into cash.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.860]   Move money out of the bank, move it into hard assets.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:04.400]   Assets that can be owned by your wife and are not as easily traced as money that's sitting
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.200]   in a bank account.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.960]   Don't waste the opportunity to make sure.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.960]   Your number one goal in this situation should be to care for your loved ones.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:22.000]   Long-time listeners of Radical Personal Finance know I very much want you to always stand
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.240]   good for what you owe.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.160]   I want your debts to be paid.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:32.260]   But I want people who are in a difficult situation to be equipped with knowledge.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:40.200]   I despise hearing about families who are facing cancer and their credit card companies are
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.320]   calling and they start cashing money out of the 401(k) in order to pay the credit cards.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.200]   Usually that's the wrong plan.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.580]   Don't pay the credit cards.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.000]   They knew what they were going into.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.480]   It was a business deal.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.560]   You'll pay them when you can, but while you're dealing with it, keep your protection in place
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.960]   for you.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:04.900]   So big picture, transfer liabilities into the estate of the sick spouse, transfer assets
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.680]   into the estate of the healthy spouse.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.720]   Hopefully you've avoided debt in the first place.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.780]   I would not.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:17.260]   If you're in a strong financial position, don't go out and just start racking up debts.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.760]   That's not a good plan and you put yourself in legal jeopardy, especially if you've done
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.480]   it intentionally with an intent to defraud the insurance company or the financing company.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   Don't do it.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.720]   Just avoid debt in the first place.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.040]   But if you're already in a difficult situation, try to protect yourself as much as possible.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.960]   Second, try to move your debt from any kind of secured debt to unsecured debt.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   If my wife and I own a car and I know that I'm going to die and we owe $10,000 on the
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:52.020]   car, I'm going to try to move $10,000 of car debt off of the car onto a credit card, which
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.280]   is an unsecured debt, so that at least my wife will have the car and not worry about
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.120]   the car getting repossessed.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.680]   If it were feasible with a mortgage, example in the state of Florida, where I live, in
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:12.460]   the state of Florida, all of your homestead is protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:18.400]   So if I had a $40,000 mortgage balance remaining on my home and if I had $40,000 of credit
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.760]   line available on my credit cards, I would do a cash advance and I would take the money
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.600]   from my credit cards and use it to pay off my home.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.080]   You need to be careful there because of course that comes with massive difference of fees
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.200]   and charges, etc.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:41.480]   But conceptually, if it's possible to do that, conceptually I want to pay off secured debt.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:47.360]   My goal is when I die, I want my wife to own as many assets as possible.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:54.440]   Next, plan your assets so that the debt is sealed off as much as possible.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.920]   Pretend my particular client has a portfolio of rental properties.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.560]   Let's say that you have five houses, six houses, and on your six houses, each of your house
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.040]   has a 50% loan to value ratio.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.280]   So you have 50% of the value of the house is mortgaged on each of the properties and
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.760]   that's spread across all of the assets.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:23.240]   If I were in the situation, I would try to renegotiate and refinance the houses so I
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:29.360]   could move the debt from each of the houses onto half the portfolio.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:36.040]   I would rather have three houses owned without mortgages and three houses owned with mortgages
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.440]   than have six houses with 50% mortgages.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.480]   That way, hopefully my wife will be able to continue paying everything.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.760]   We can pay the mortgages off, she'll continue to own those rentals, et cetera.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.920]   But if we get into trouble and we can't pay them, maybe our finances are drained because
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.640]   of our medical condition, if we can't pay those mortgages, I want to make sure that
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.160]   if at all possible, we don't lose all the houses.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.520]   We'll only lose a couple of the houses.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.960]   So try to seal off your debt as much as possible.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:09.120]   If your family owns three cars and they all have car payments, consider refinancing them
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.040]   and moving the financing onto one of them.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:24.440]   So at least two of them are owned without debt.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.840]   Managing debt and assets properly, I think will make a big, big difference.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.560]   Now in thinking further about the situation, I think it's important for us to start and
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.880]   to think about what would we need life insurance for?
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.000]   What would I do if I were diagnosed and someone says, "Joshua, you have five years to live.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.320]   Could be longer, could be shorter, but we think you're going to have five years to live."
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:55.880]   I would think very, very carefully about how do I provide for the family's needs knowing
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.200]   that I can't get life insurance.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.280]   By way of inspiration, I remember when I was a young child, my family visited a family
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.720]   who had, the father had died.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.440]   By my memory, the family was large, they had a large number of children.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.880]   But I was impressed even as a child that although the father had died early with a house full
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.680]   of young children, this family was in a good situation.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   Why?
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.040]   Well, they had moved to a rural area with a low cost of living.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.380]   They had built from scratch their own home, a beautiful log home.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.380]   This was in Montana.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.080]   We were visiting a beautiful log home in Montana.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.380]   The home was built with no debt.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:38.720]   They had developed a family-run business.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:45.160]   And when the father died, the family was able to continue on because they had no debt, they
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.520]   had low expenses, and they had a family-run business.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.160]   Even at an early age, I appreciated that testimony.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.600]   That was a father who took his responsibility seriously.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:02.020]   Life insurance is a wonderful invention, but thoughtful people have been planning for the
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:08.580]   well-being of their families since long before life insurance were ever invented.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.680]   And the way you do it is to go back to those fundamentals.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.840]   What are those things that a family would need?
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.300]   What are they fundamentally?
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.380]   So let's talk through them.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.600]   The first thing would be obvious expenses like burial costs.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   Well, if I knew that I were going to die, I would go ahead and have my plywood casket
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   built.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.360]   I would build it myself or have a buddy build it so that when I died, my casket were sitting
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   right there.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.440]   My wife didn't have to deal with going and finding that.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   Archives of Radical Personal Finance, we talked about how to get buried inexpensively.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.120]   If I knew I were going to die, I would figure out where is my body going to be buried, and
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   I would do it as cheaply as possible.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.640]   If the laws allow us to just plant me under the oak tree out back, then I'll figure out
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.760]   who's going to talk to my buddies.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.840]   "Hey, you two, when I die, you come over and you dig the grave.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.160]   I need to go in there.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:05.440]   I'll buy the book on how to care for the body and make sure that there are people who have
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.800]   been trained and who have learned how are we going to care for my body when I die so
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.560]   that my wife doesn't have to be the one to do that."
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.760]   If we get to the funeral, I'm going to plan out the funeral, and I'm going to say, "Here's
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   what's going to happen.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.880]   Here's where it's going to be.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.480]   We're not having some ridiculous $10,000 funeral.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.440]   Here's where we're going to do the funeral cheap.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.560]   What's the building we're going to use?
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   Who's got a house?
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   Who's got a backyard?"
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.200]   I would work to arrange those circumstances as much as possible.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:35.360]   I would do everything possible to minimize burial expenses and minimize emotional trauma
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.720]   for my grieving wife so that she doesn't have to face those things.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   And here's where good planning will result in a lower outlay.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.800]   By planning in advance what would be necessary for the funeral, by going ahead and getting
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.840]   the coffin, if we buy it at Walmart or have it shipped in or build it out of plywood,
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.280]   let's get the coffin squared away, let's get the burial squared away, let's get the people
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.320]   assigned, let's figure out what's going to be done so that when the number gets filled
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.560]   in on the exact day of my death, then it's just a matter of, "Here's the book.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.560]   Here's the manual.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.560]   Here's what you do."
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   That lowers burial expenses.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:16.660]   That's a big deal because frequently a grieving spouse just lost their husband, just lost
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.660]   their wife.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.440]   A grieving spouse will look at that and say, "Well, I've got to provide for this funeral,"
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.320]   and frequently all of a sudden there's $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, $30,000 out of pocket.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.800]   If you want to go a more traditional route, you tackle it head on, go meet with the person,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.540]   make the burial arrangements, buy the plot, whatever the situation is.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.840]   But I would personally take the cheap route.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.560]   I don't want people spending $1,000 on a coffin that's going to rot in the ground, build it
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.660]   out of plywood, ask a couple of buddies of mine to do that.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.180]   So that's the first thing.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:55.700]   The second thing is what about immediate expenses, immediately following my death?
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.820]   Not funeral expenses, but immediate expenses.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.340]   Well, that's where I've talked about assets already.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.860]   I want to make sure that assets are transitioned.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.100]   I'm going to make sure that we have no money in the bank.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:11.340]   All of the money that was in the bank has been turned into cash and hard assets.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.140]   For example, food.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.220]   How is my family going to eat?
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:26.620]   Well, you can solve the eating problem more directly than just saying, "I need $10,000
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.500]   of life insurance to solve the food."
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.420]   I would go ahead and get busy and say, "Here's how we're going to solve the food problem.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.460]   First thing we're going to do, we're going to store food."
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.900]   I would feel a whole lot better.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:40.500]   If I've got five years to prepare, I'd feel a whole lot better knowing that our family
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:46.660]   has a couple of years of food stored up in reserve so that my children aren't going to
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.660]   go hungry and my wife's not going to starve.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.700]   Then looking at an empty pantry.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.100]   Well, guess what?
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:01.460]   If you get serious about food storage, a couple thousand bucks can buy enough food to keep
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:06.980]   my family going for a few years of just simply stored food.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.700]   You better believe I'm taking my credit card down to Costco.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.940]   I'm buying bags of rice.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.940]   I'm buying bags of bean.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.260]   I'm buying flats of vegetables.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.940]   These are hard assets.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.620]   I'm going to make sure that my family's need for food is met.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.820]   Now, another context would be food production.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.420]   Do we have a way to produce food?
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:33.380]   If I've got small children, how am I going to make sure that my children are going to
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.620]   be able to eat?
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:41.260]   Now, with my family's approach, I would want very much my wife to be able to fulfill the
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:47.500]   vision that we have for our family and not to immediately have to say, "Well, she's just
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.220]   got to go and get a 40 or 50 hour a week job."
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:56.140]   I would work really hard to figure out a new living situation that would allow our family
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.660]   to produce more of our food.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.580]   Children can be very, very helpful in the garden.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.020]   So I get busy and say, "How can we get the garden planted?
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.300]   How can we turn our—let's rip out the lawn in the front yard, rip out the lawn in the
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.220]   backyard and let's get the garden in so that my family can eat."
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.560]   Simple things like shelter.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.700]   I would change whatever circumstance necessary in order to have shelter.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.340]   If I knew I were probably going to die, let's say that we were living in a fancier house,
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:27.980]   perhaps we have a mortgage, we're living in a fancier house, but we know that there's
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:33.060]   a good chance that that was based upon our higher income with me working and being productive,
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.340]   but now I might die.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.020]   Well, let's move into a small house.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.460]   Perhaps we can own that house debt free so that way I can at least know my wife's not
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:45.340]   going to be evicted from our house.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.940]   Now if we don't have money, I'm going to work really diligently to try to figure out what
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:57.280]   relationship capital can we use to make sure that my family's cared for.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.700]   Do my parents have an ability to take us in or to build an addition or put a mobile home
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.700]   out back of their house?
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.180]   How are we going to make sure that a shelter is cared for?
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.340]   If you look at the problem and you disconnect it from life insurance and you study it in
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:21.380]   the context of shelter, now you have an opportunity to fix it.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:26.020]   If your problem is shelter and you approach it as shelter saying, "How can I get shelter?"
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.100]   then you can start your creative juices going.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.860]   We might just be buying a big fifth wheel trailer and parking it out back of mom and
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:39.500]   dad's house, but at least my wife and children aren't going to be on the street.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.220]   We might be building a tiny house.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:47.120]   We might be parking a single wide trailer out back somewhere, depending on a friend
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:52.980]   or family member who has some rural acreage, but at least I can plan for shelter.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:56.860]   How do I provide shelter for my family?
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.660]   Education.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:04.180]   One of the major costs that when I do a life insurance analysis that I plan for is education.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.300]   Frequently we sit down with the parents and say, "Well, how much money do you want for
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.560]   college, for high school?
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.780]   How much money do you want for college?
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.580]   Do you want to plan for private school, public school, et cetera?"
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.020]   And usually there's some amount of money there for education.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.020]   Hold on.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:24.640]   If I don't have the ability to buy life insurance to provide for education, that doesn't automatically
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.940]   mean that I can't provide education.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.820]   I've always been inspired by the example of a man named Art Robinson.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.740]   Art Robinson is an interesting guy.
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:44.420]   I first found him when I found his website, which is at the, it's called robinsoncurriculum.com.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:52.980]   It's a really interesting story, but Art Robinson, he and his wife are both research scientists,
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.940]   both PhD holders, research scientists.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:00.060]   He researches a bunch of things, especially relating to blood and a couple of other things,
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.620]   nuclear stuff beyond my scientific knowledge.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.360]   But he and his wife had a large family, six children.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:14.900]   And when their youngest child was a baby, his wife contracted a very strange illness
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:22.880]   and died within something like 24 or 48 hours, leaving him as a surviving widower with six
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.340]   small children.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.540]   They had been homeschooling their children, and that was very important to them in terms
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:34.220]   of the educational heritage and the family values that they were seeking to instill in
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   their children.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:41.080]   And so here he is as a research scientist, a busy research scientist, unexpectedly, completely
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:47.860]   out of the blue with no time to transition, facing six small children trying to figure
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.100]   out what do I do?
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:56.440]   Well, one of the things that he did, he was blessed by his wife's foresight and planning
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.700]   with regard to their children's homeschool curriculum.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:05.600]   She had worked for years on developing and planning ahead with homeschool materials.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.640]   So when she died, his wife, her name was Laura Lee, when she died, his wife, Laura Lee, left
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:16.720]   behind multiple filing cabinets with all of the materials, all of the books, all of the
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   curriculum prepared for a complete K through 12 education.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:28.000]   What he did was he moved his desk into his children's schoolroom or moved his children's
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.560]   schoolrooms into his research laboratory, and they figured out a way to care for the
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.560]   baby.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.920]   They figured out a schedule where his older children were able to help care for the baby,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:44.640]   and they continued their educational plan just like they had done from the beginning
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.540]   because his wife had worked so hard and had left a legacy in that complete curriculum.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.160]   They later went on, and his children, while they were in their high school years, later
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.260]   went on and developed the Robinson curriculum.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.920]   They took all of the materials that their mother had put together.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:08.220]   They scanned them, collected them, and sold them and created a business out of selling
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:14.560]   those materials to any other homeschool family that was interested, and they sold them as
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.560]   a set of CD-ROMs.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.600]   They still sell them today.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:24.200]   For $200, you can purchase from them all in, $200, you can purchase a complete K through
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:31.560]   12 educational curriculum for $200 total, one time, no matter how many children you
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.240]   do, no matter how much you need.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.520]   You can buy it, and you print out the materials.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:42.000]   Some of that curriculum is dated, but you could start, and I would have no fear whatsoever
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.540]   if I were dying of saying to my wife, "We're going to buy this curriculum," and the secret
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.080]   to it is you print everything out.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.080]   "We're going to buy this curriculum.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   We're going to buy the printer.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.160]   Now, at least we have the necessary school materials."
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.000]   His children, of their six children, had some very impressive educational outcomes.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.120]   I think four of his six children have PhDs.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.160]   All of them are extremely competent with regard to their learning.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:10.160]   He has continued on to do his scientific research, and they let a lot of things go.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.800]   If you listen to him lecture on it, and he tells a story, it wasn't the most, shall
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.920]   we say, traditional of households.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:22.280]   They certainly weren't able to do everything the way that he would have been as a couple
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.560]   if his wife had survived, but as a single widower with six small children, they were
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.360]   able to come out with a loving family, stayed together.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.800]   He continued his work, his productive work.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   All of his children were educational stars, and they continued to maintain the family
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   of image that they had planned for.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:48.160]   If you break it down into education, instead of funding it vaguely with life insurance,
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.320]   you could say, "What are we going to do?
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.040]   How are we going to provide for education?"
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.800]   Now, perhaps homeschooling is your thing, and you would do something like I've described
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   here.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.480]   Perhaps, if I were in that situation, I would say, "We're going to take our money, and
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.600]   we're going to turn it," since if we had debt, and hopefully, again, hopefully we don't
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:08.360]   have debt, but I'm trying to make this show accessible to a listener who is in a tough
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.400]   situation, I would say, "How can we make sure that we assemble homeschool materials?"
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.480]   At the very least, everyone in the world has 200 bucks to buy the Robinson curriculum,
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.680]   a printer, and a stack of paper to print out the materials.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.880]   At the very least, everyone has 200 bucks.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:30.040]   Or you might go with more than that, but assemble the materials for your children's education.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.200]   Or perhaps another consideration, in a moment, I'm going to talk about income, but another
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.680]   consideration would be, you might say, "Well, we can't afford, we don't want to homeschool,
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.480]   or homeschooling is just not going to work based upon the capacity of our family.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:47.080]   But we do need income, but education is serious."
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.920]   So I would look at that and say, "How can we get my wife a job at a private school?"
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.680]   If I could help my wife to get a job at a private school, then now as a component of
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   that overall education, we could now send our children to the private school with a
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.880]   reduced or eliminated tuition cost.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:12.280]   Frequently, many private schools will provide for their employees the benefit, instead of
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.920]   paying out a higher salary, they'll provide a benefit that a certain number of their children
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:24.480]   can attend that private school without paying or by paying a reduced rate.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:30.400]   There is a mother that I've known for many years who was left as a single mom, and one
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:36.480]   of the things that I deeply honor her for, her husband left her, divorced her, she was
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.680]   left as a single mom with four young girls to care for.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:46.000]   One of the things that she did is she always worked at a local private school, and she
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.680]   worked very diligently.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.560]   She drove school buses, and she worked in the cafeteria.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.080]   She had very limited job skills.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:58:02.520]   She didn't have the intellectual or background to be a high-income earner, but by working
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:07.560]   for the local private school, she was able to earn enough to keep a roof over her girl's
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:14.720]   head, to keep food on the table, and to provide for a very strong private school education
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.480]   for all of her daughters.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.800]   That would be a way of saying, "How do we solve the education problem without additional
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   money?"
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:29.040]   A similar type of thing can be done with college costs.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.480]   By researching and helping our children prepare to pay for their own cost of college, we can
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.120]   mitigate the need for that life insurance.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.320]   Let's talk about income.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.120]   The other aspect of life insurance planning is income.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.920]   How can we provide an income for the family?
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.040]   Usually when doing a life insurance analysis, you simply sit down and say, "Well, we want
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:58.760]   to have $4,000 a month into the family for 20 years, or for the rest of my wife's life,"
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.560]   or whatever context that is.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.480]   "Well, if I can't get life insurance, I've got a problem.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:10.920]   So I need to figure out what can we do to provide income when I'm gone?"
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.140]   This is where we get back to ideas like a family business.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:21.720]   One of the things I most appreciated about that particular family that we visited when
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:26.600]   I was a child was they had done the hard work of developing a family business where the
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.720]   children could contribute.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:35.400]   This allowed the surviving wife, the widow, to be able to still be involved with the children
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:41.080]   and for them to keep their family together in a very difficult time.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:49.640]   So if I'm facing a five-year diagnosis, I'm going to look very diligently to say, "What
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.680]   skills does my wife have?
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.080]   What resources do we have?
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.160]   How can we establish a family business that will be enough to provide an income for the
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.160]   family?"
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.960]   Now, here's where you would look at the total package.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:11.920]   Do you look at where somebody is living, what the situation is?
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.520]   How do we provide for this?
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.320]   I use by way of example, let's say that we decided, "Okay, we need to move to a slightly
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.740]   more rural area."
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.760]   We could find potentially some rural area that had enough proximity to hospital and
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.600]   medical providers for me to continue my oncology treatments.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.200]   But we could then also look at providing for the family.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.000]   We could have a big garden, we could buy a single-wide trailer or a double-wide trailer.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.160]   It would be inexpensive.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.600]   We could own it debt-free so that my wife wouldn't have the concern of paying a mortgage.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.720]   So now, what business could we develop in this context based upon the skills and the
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.820]   resources that our family has?
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.720]   That would be one way of providing for income.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.480]   Another way would be a more traditional job.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:02.640]   So I would look at my wife's job skills, my children's job skills, and say, "How can we
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.240]   enhance these?"
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.640]   Back to that financial planning, one of the things that I would seriously consider doing
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:16.720]   is I would seriously consider turning money into job skills.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.460]   Let's say that my wife would benefit from an additional certification.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.840]   Maybe she needs to get training in a certain area.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.720]   Perhaps that training costs money.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.680]   I'm going to work really hard to take our money, use it to buy the training so that
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:40.400]   we can establish her in a high-income earning career so that when I die, she'll have the
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.880]   income necessary.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.520]   This is especially important many times for if a father or husband is going to die.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.800]   Frequently, a mom who has given up her income earning outside of the home will be left with
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.480]   slightly rusty job skills and a little bit out of step with the job market.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.080]   That can make it hard for a new widow to go into the job market and earn at an appropriate
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:12.860]   rate, especially if you have children, to earn at a rate that makes it worth her leaving
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.000]   the children who would really benefit from her presence.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.880]   So if necessary, take the money and use it to buy upgraded job skills, certifications,
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:30.080]   specializations, etc., so that she can earn enough money in order to have a high hourly
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.580]   productivity so she can still have time with children.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:39.840]   This is another similar problem that many time newly divorced mothers face, is that
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:46.840]   their job skills have grown rusty as they've cared for their children.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.920]   And so when their husband leaves them, they're faced with, "Well, what do I do?"
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:57.880]   And sometimes their earning ability is only a very small percentage of their capacity.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.620]   And that can be a real problem, because then that newly single mom has to spend many hours
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   per day away from the children, and that would be the most valuable place for her would be
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.840]   to be with the children.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.720]   Well, you can't do without income, but perhaps what can be done is upgrade the hourly earning
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.700]   ability with whatever appropriate plan would solve that, so that she can earn sufficient
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:24.220]   amounts of money while being away from the children for a minimal amount of time.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:32.340]   So with income, income can be solved, or at least improved, in ways that don't require
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.880]   a life insurance payout.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.920]   Now back to investments.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.040]   What if you have investments?
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.040]   Hopefully you have investments.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:45.800]   And here's where we want to structure things in a way that they're going to be in their
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:53.400]   best...they're going to be done well after I'm gone.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.640]   I don't know how to speak to this generally.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:02.360]   I've already spoken to mutual funds, investments, being held in creditor-protected accounts.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:07.000]   There's not a lot of skill related to mutual funds.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.800]   But I would work very diligently with my wife to, especially me, I'd work very diligently
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.320]   with my wife to make sure that she has the knowledge that she needs to be a successful
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.600]   investor, to make sure that she knows the source of trusted advice, etc.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.600]   With other investments, my client that I was working with was a heavy real estate investor,
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.400]   and one of the pieces of advice that I gave to him was it's very important that his wife
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.760]   is very involved in that real estate business.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:39.880]   Usually there will be one spouse or another who is involved heavily in a business and
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.160]   the other spouse is not so heavily involved in the business.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:49.480]   That can work okay as long as the spouse who's involved has taken the time to put together
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:55.360]   a manual of how the business operates, some instructions, etc. so that if they died unexpectedly
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.820]   that their surviving spouse would be able to continue on.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.800]   But if you know that you're probably going to die in a few years, then you really got
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:10.320]   to roll up your sleeves and make sure that your spouse is fully involved in the investments.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.600]   I would very diligently make sure that my wife was fully involved and actively managing
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   our real estate portfolio, actively managing our business, etc.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:28.520]   You've got to make sure that she is knowledgeable about every aspect of the money and that her
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.600]   skills are up to the task.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:39.680]   One of the most vulnerable places that a woman can be in, especially women, is if they're
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.680]   newly widowed.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:48.160]   And frequently a newly widowed woman is caught unaware and caught with poor planning.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.180]   And because her husband handled everything, she doesn't know where everything is, how
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.960]   it's all done, etc.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.820]   I think that's a major dereliction of duty for husbands.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:02.300]   If you are a husband, do not leave your wife in that situation.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.600]   Make sure that you've left instructions.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.560]   Make sure that you've left layout.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:12.340]   Make sure that you've helped her and taught her to know what's going on so that if you
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:21.000]   are unexpectedly removed from the scene that she's not left not knowing what to do.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:30.340]   And here, I think fundamentally when you look at the problem of how to solve these issues,
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.060]   I think you have to go back and look at relationships.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.260]   Relationships and community.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:44.620]   As I thought through this, I realized that I personally would have no fear of being in
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.340]   this situation.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:50.460]   I would have no fear of if I couldn't, didn't have life insurance, I were diagnosed with
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:57.940]   a terminal disease, I would have no fear of my wife and children not being okay.
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.120]   Even independent of any of these things I've described.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:09.860]   And one of the big reasons is because of the strong family, community, and church relationships
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.300]   that we enjoy.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:18.540]   I would have no fear about my wife being put out on the street because I know that I have
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:24.100]   many people in my life who would immediately say, "Come and live with us."
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.780]   There are many people in my life who would say, "Come, I'll buy a single wide trailer
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:31.500]   and you can be there so you can have your own place with the children and we'll park
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.260]   it on our property."
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.220]   There are many people in my life who would say, "Come, I'll tell you what, here's an
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.220]   apartment.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:42.900]   I know you can't afford all of that rent, but I'll subsidize it by 50% and I'll do that
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:44.420]   for the next decade."
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:51.540]   That all comes back to relationships, strong family relationships and strong community
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.940]   relationships.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:08:01.300]   At its core, when there's a strong community, a strong family of people, these financial
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.820]   things are less necessary.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:10.580]   But with the modern US American society, these financial things are more necessary because
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.700]   of the fracturing of relationships.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.500]   Let me give two examples to drive this point home.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.980]   I have an interest in understanding the Amish community.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.540]   I've never lived in Amish country and I always thought it'd be fascinating to drive through
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.540]   Amish country.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:30.940]   But I've had an interest in studying how the Amish handle finances.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:34.360]   First I respect and appreciate them, that they were able to get out of the debacle of
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:41.700]   Social Security and unfortunately, Protestant Christians were not, which I have a deep grudge
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:46.500]   against Protestant Christians for not towing the line on that one.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.360]   But the reason that the Amish have been able to stay out of things, Amish not participating
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.500]   in financialized insurance programs, not participating in Social Security, even not participating
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:01.240]   in much of the commercial credit markets, is because of the strength of the community.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.940]   Everything is based on the community.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:04.940]   And it works well.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.980]   I have more confidence in the strength of my local community than I do in any financial
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.740]   institution.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:17.700]   But that community has to be developed and exercised in advance.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.520]   There are communities in which if you're going to have a house raising or a barn raising,
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   you could have dozens and dozens of people there.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.200]   But yet the lives that many of us lead in the modern society would be that if a house
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:40.840]   were needed or a barn were needed, many families couldn't get a single person to show up.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.660]   Now you think about that.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.640]   So you're familiar with the traditional barn raising.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.160]   This was in the old, in the more agrarian society.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.920]   If somebody was going to have a barn, there would be a community event.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.760]   And so the landowner would prepare ahead, they would put together the materials, the
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.200]   raw materials, and then they would schedule it and all the community would come together.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.640]   And then they would do the heavy work of raising the rafters, raising the walls.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.480]   All that would be done together because you need a lot of manpower.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.280]   And then traditionally it would be a big party at night, perhaps a dance in the barn or whatever
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280]   was necessary.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.720]   That's a barn raising.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.960]   Same kind of thing with the house raising.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.640]   So I've reflected on this question.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:26.280]   I realized that is one of the biggest weaknesses in our modern era.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:32.840]   If our house burns down, we don't have anyone to call except an insurance company.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.780]   And they might send a check, hopefully, and we might be able to buy those things.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:45.040]   But there are communities where if the house burns down, everybody comes together.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.440]   Some people load up a truck, bring a bunch of wood.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.280]   People have knowledge, they have skill, everyone gets together and a week later the house is
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.260]   built.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:59.920]   If you have the strength of relationships and community, strong families, I say large
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.600]   families, strong churches, strong community organizations where people are built together,
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.600]   you can have a high degree of confidence in this.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.960]   The story that happened this last year that I was aware of, in my mind it shows the ideal
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.880]   scenario, it shows the value of this.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.660]   There was a man this last year who unexpectedly drowned.
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.740]   And this man and his wife, they had adopted, I think it was a total of seven young children.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.980]   And all of the children were very young.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.620]   So unlike a family that may have by natural birth seven children where the children are
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.460]   split out in ages, they had adopted seven young children.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:44.140]   That's a heavy burden, heavy burden on a mother and father.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:51.500]   The man unexpectedly drowned while they were at the lake and it was totally out of the
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:55.700]   blue and the family didn't have life insurance for whatever reason.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:12:01.740]   And so here you have a young widow, a mother of seven small adopted children who've just
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.700]   lost their father.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:10.980]   Take a moment and imagine the trauma on a young adopted child, the potential trauma
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:19.600]   of previously being orphaned through whatever circumstances and then being adopted into
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:26.620]   a loving family and now all of a sudden losing one of those adoptive parents.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:34.060]   Sorry, but that is a situation that is a big, big deal for those seven children.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:37.540]   And what I was so gratified to hear was in the circumstance Juan, the community, took
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:43.400]   up collections of financial donations, which was of course helpful.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.460]   But there was in that community somebody who went ahead and provided for that lady.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:50.500]   It was a man who was a wealthier person.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.540]   He had acreage, he had land, and he established on his house, I think they brought in a double
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.380]   wide trailer or something like that, and he bought a double wide trailer.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:04.180]   He put it on his rural property so that that mom would be able to care for those seven
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:08.980]   children and not have to immediately put them into an institution.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:13.580]   If you want to talk about using your money to make an impact, that's the way to do it.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:18.420]   If you want to talk about the value of community, that's a pretty good example.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:26.100]   So make sure if you don't have that in your life, get busy and find it or build it.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.500]   Because at the end of the day, financial institutions are great.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:37.940]   I've tried to talk about how to use them, but relationships and community, strong families,
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:44.060]   strong communities, strong churches, strong networks, that's ultimately what gets you
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:47.340]   through is people.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:53.260]   I hope that's encouraging to you, and I hope you are able to use that and to be the catalyst
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:56.260]   for change in your local community.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.820]   Hope these ideas are helpful.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:04.660]   I hope that this show serves you and serves somebody who's in this difficult situation.
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:08.620]   If you understand the things that I talked about in the beginning, especially if you
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:15.280]   understand things like ownership, use the financial system to your benefit.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.220]   If you've gotten a diagnosis, like I said, if I got a diagnosis, I would do every one
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.460]   of these things.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.300]   I would make sure that we took, in the time that I had that I was alive, I'd make sure
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:30.580]   that we took every bit of money, and I would make sure that I very carefully structured
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:33.980]   all the assets for maximum protection.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:42.860]   And I would take the money and I would use the money to buy those things that will provide
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.900]   for my family.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:49.380]   And even, there may be other circumstances in which you can do it, but just consider
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.500]   that.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:56.420]   You can buy educational materials, and if you are in a situation, you're going to leave,
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:03.300]   if I were going to leave my wife and children behind, it's pretty hard for me to imagine,
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.360]   let's say that I had started off deeply in debt and I had problems because I wanted this
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.460]   show to work for someone in that situation.
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:16.380]   It's easy to imagine the creditor coming and hooking up the car out front.
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:20.440]   It's easy to imagine being sued by a credit card company.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:26.220]   But if you pay off the note on the car, the car will sit there.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:31.580]   I can't imagine the credit card company sending the police out and searching through our file
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:36.900]   cabinet of educational materials and saying, "We're going to take these educational materials."
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.220]   They're not going to go and search through the pantry and say, "We're going to take all
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:43.140]   this food that's going to feed your family for the next few years."
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:50.540]   They're not going to come through the house and find that we bought a commercial, we bought
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.660]   some homemade bread from somebody recently who had put this very nice cottage industry
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.060]   from homemade bread.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:01.060]   They're not going to find the commercial quality bread machine that we've built for a family
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:07.260]   business that my wife and our children could do and sell artisan bread in the local community.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.340]   So that's the way that you need to think, is you need to think if you're in a situation
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:17.420]   like this, how do I use the financial system to provide those other things for my family?
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.900]   In closing, make sure this doesn't happen to you.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:26.140]   I repeat, make sure this doesn't happen to you.
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.340]   If you're already in this situation, hopefully these ideas will help you or will help you
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.860]   to help someone else who's in the situation.
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:39.060]   One of my missions is I want to equip you so that you can go and help the people who
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.740]   are never going to sit and listen to radical personal finance.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:48.860]   Only a tiny, tiny percentage of people will go and sit and listen to something like this.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:53.700]   I probably lost with talking about financial products and annuities and single premium
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:59.860]   median annuities and variable subaccounts and annuity units, I lost the vast majority
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.540]   of the population.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:06.940]   But my friend, there are people that are struggling and that are hurting, and you can go and help
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.940]   them.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.380]   You can take this knowledge and go and sit at their kitchen table and help them.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.380]   That's my mission.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:19.300]   There are a lot of people who will never sit down and listen to my show, but you're listening
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.020]   to my show, and those same people who would never sit down and listen to my show, they
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.140]   will sit down and listen to you.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:31.980]   So I hope these ideas serve you so that you can go and help somebody who's in a situation
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:32.980]   like that.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.380]   Be back with you soon.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380]   Thank you for listening.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:41.620]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:46.440]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.160]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.740]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:59.300]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.340]   action on it.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:06.740]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.060]   to a life change.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:13.060]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.700]   So take action.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:20.380]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.940]   that you care about.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:29.140]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.620]   that I'm seeking to share.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:37.460]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:44.260]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:49.580]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.300]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
