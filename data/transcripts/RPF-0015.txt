[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.860]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 15.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:55.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.680]   Today's show is going to be about one of my favorite topics.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.260]   It's taxes.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.740]   Well, actually, taxes aren't my favorite topic.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.060]   My favorite topic is how to avoid taxes.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.620]   And that's what today's show is going to be about.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.680]   How to avoid all of your taxes.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.960]   Stay with us.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:29.480]   So if you want to know the one thing that's going to make a bigger difference in how much
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.640]   money you're going to make, it's going to be taxes.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.800]   And if you're going to spend more money than just about anything else, I would say that
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.720]   that one thing is taxes.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.540]   And more than anything, how to not pay them.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.600]   So today we're going to talk about how to not pay your taxes.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.960]   Now, obviously, you have the solution of simply just don't pay them.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.940]   But that solution comes with certain other consequences that you may or may not be comfortable
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.280]   with.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.820]   I'm not comfortable with those consequences.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.920]   That's up to you.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.640]   But you choose what you want to do with that.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   I'm not comfortable with those.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.060]   So we're going to be with that.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.400]   Excuse me.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.440]   With those consequences.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.940]   So today we are going to be talking about how to avoid the taxes.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.520]   And this is going to make, I believe, a bigger difference in how much money you have to spend,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.700]   how much money you have to save, how much money you have to invest than almost any other
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.080]   topic that I can think of to discuss today.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.380]   So before we get into that, a couple of quick announcements.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.060]   So super excited.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.640]   Today is July 8th, Tuesday, and we are live in iTunes.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.360]   So.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.120]   You will find us live in iTunes now.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.280]   Just got the approval yesterday.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.520]   So feel free to go on there and look us up under Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.040]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.500]   Subscribe, please.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.820]   Would love to hear from you if you are enjoying the show.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.380]   If you're not enjoying the show, that's cool, too.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.580]   Happy to hear from you if you have that to say.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.260]   But we are live in iTunes.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.600]   So now we have the largest directory.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.300]   And I have also submitted the show to a number of other places.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.500]   So feel free to not use iTunes if you don't want to use that.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.520]   But I know that's the 100-pound gorilla in the marketplace and more people are using
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.180]   that than just about anything else.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.220]   Also, I have our email list set up.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.860]   So consider if you're interested in the show and you're enjoying the show, please come
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.300]   by the website and consider subscribing to the email list.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.220]   And here's why.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.960]   We do a lot of shows.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.720]   As you know, we do one every single day.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.780]   And you may or may not be interested in all of the topics that we have here.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.540]   So I don't expect necessarily expect you to be interested in all the topics.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.100]   That's fine.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.260]   But in our email list, you will receive a notification as soon as we publish the show
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.860]   every day.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.480]   And that's...
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.140]   That notification will contain all of the show notes.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.220]   Now, I do my best to give good comprehensive show notes.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.020]   But realistically, it takes a long time.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.180]   And so some days it's short and I got to get it done and get it published.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.740]   And some days I can spend a lot of time putting the really nice show notes together.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.720]   However, if you would like to get an email that contains all of those show notes, none
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.880]   of this dumb first three paragraphs, then you got to go click over to the site.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.820]   Bothers me when people do that.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.840]   I know why.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.120]   I guess you're supposed to have people come into your website so that they can connect
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.580]   with you there.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.940]   But...
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.840]   Usually a lot of times I get them on my phone and I don't want to go to the website.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.400]   I don't want to click over to Safari.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.840]   So I usually just hit cancel.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.020]   So in my email list, you receive the full show notes each and every day.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.200]   And then you can decide if it's something that you're interested in listening to, interested
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.380]   in referring to, or interested in just skipping.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.340]   No problem either way.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.520]   So please come by the site at radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.480]   You'll see right there on the front page, top right, get notified of new episodes.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.940]   And would love it if you would join our email list.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.620]   It's only going to be used for sharing.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.220]   The show information and the show notes.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.040]   Expect it to be a lot of emails.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.200]   It's going to be one every day.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.480]   So five days a week, basically.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.900]   You'll receive an email.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.940]   But I think that'll be the best way for you to keep tabs on what's going on with the show
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.360]   every day.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.840]   And also those show notes contain all the links, all the information from the day's
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.940]   show.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.760]   So if you'd like to check me out, if you want to fact check me, if you want the outline
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.460]   of the show, that'd be a really good way and convenient way for you to do it.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.900]   Also appreciate your comments.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.300]   Comments on the show.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.420]   I really appreciate those.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.720]   It's going to help a lot.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.460]   And those of you who are listening at this point, you have the opportunity to guide,
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.680]   to provide significant input into the direction of the show.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.340]   I'm creating what's in my mind, the kind of show that I would like to listen to.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.220]   But you have the opportunity to guide the show.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.200]   I'll give you an example of a really great comment I received just last night on the
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.020]   about page over at the show by the username is, I guess, Friganito.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.960]   I like Friganism.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.480]   That's cool.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.120]   I'd like to talk to someone about Friganism at some point in the future.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   But he was just talking about topics of interest.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.040]   To him or her, it says, you know, great to have you back.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.340]   I think your show has huge potential.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.160]   Topics of interest.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.840]   Hard assets such as platinum.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.800]   Is it possible to use an IRA to buy hard assets?
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.160]   Money supply basics such as inflation.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.360]   Why is inflation this topic?
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.120]   Always presented as a complex topic when it's actually really simple.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.940]   Why do so many people misunderstand it?
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.060]   Why can a credit card company get such high percentages, but savings accounts get less
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.720]   than 4%?
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.180]   I love those topic ideas.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.160]   I think that's super fun.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.380]   I don't know anything about investing in hard assets such as platinum.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   Never.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.020]   Never done it.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.080]   Never had any interest in it.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.580]   Pretty comfortable with the topic of investing in gold and silver.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.440]   But I have no knowledge whatsoever about something like that.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.780]   But I'd love to know if you guys...
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.040]   That's the kind of topic that I'd love to interview somebody.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.580]   So my reply back to him was, hey, do you know anybody who's really good at a question like
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.860]   that?
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.660]   And if you do, let me know and I'll try to get in touch with them for an email.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.180]   And I've got it now on my list of...
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.440]   Excuse me.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.960]   For an interview.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.520]   And I've got that show topic now on my list of potential show topics of things that would
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.600]   be interesting to talk about.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.700]   And then the...
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.480]   Is it possible to use an IRA to buy hard assets?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.420]   Absolutely.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.900]   It's actually one of the most researched topics among the gold and silver bugs that you find.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.140]   The answer is yes, it is possible.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.220]   And no, I wouldn't do it.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.060]   But we'll skip that.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.560]   We'll save that for another day.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   It doesn't make any sense to me to do it that way.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.760]   But we'll talk about that another day.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.340]   So today's show, we're going to talk about tax planning.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.740]   And so let's jump into the meat and potatoes.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.460]   I expect today to be pretty deep.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.320]   I expect to be doing a lot of teaching.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.280]   I expect this not to be light and easy listening.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.480]   And don't worry.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.500]   I think you...
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.660]   Don't worry if you don't get everything.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.220]   Feel free to listen to the show a couple of times.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.900]   Or just figure, you know, you'll pick up what you need to pick up.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.360]   And we'll revisit these topics again and again in the future.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.080]   But today I want to lay a foundation for the topic of tax planning.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.580]   I want to lay a foundation for how it's done and for how it's done.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.260]   Why should you care?
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.480]   Tax planning is vital.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.500]   A huge, huge, huge portion of our income goes toward taxes in all forms.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.660]   And there are...
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.720]   There are a lot of taxes that we pay in our society.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.440]   There are a lot of taxes that we pay.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.120]   But we have the option, basically, to pay.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.020]   We really have the option to pay whichever ones we want to pay.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.860]   They're all optional.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.380]   And I'll explain that in a second.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.160]   I'll prove it to you.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.920]   They're optional in a way, but they're not optional in a way.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.460]   And we'll get into kind of how that works.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.260]   I've got a few of my favorite quotes from...
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.460]   About taxes I'll sprinkle in here.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.620]   And the first quote is this from Forbes Magazine, May 11, 1990.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.620]   Politicians tax the middle class for the same reason some people rob banks.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.180]   That's where the money is.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.520]   So that's what we're going to be talking about, hopefully,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.800]   allowing your bank, your personal bank, not to be robbed.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.180]   This is a really big deal.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.960]   I've looked up some numbers this morning from the Tax Foundation,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.720]   which is a Washington, D.C.-based think tank
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.560]   that collects data and publishes various studies on tax policies.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.940]   And obviously, as with all think tanks, you've got to figure out,
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.580]   okay, what's the...
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.880]   What's the bias?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.320]   What am I comfortable with?
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.040]   You know, a lot of people don't like them.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.680]   Some people do.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.580]   But I like the work they do.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.800]   And every year they publish what they call the Tax Freedom Day,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.180]   the National Tax Freedom Day.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.180]   And the National Tax Freedom Day for 2013 in the United States of America,
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.200]   they estimate to be April 18.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.580]   So that means the first four months...
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.160]   What, would that be four months and 13 days or three months and 13 days?
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.020]   Anyway, the first...
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.800]   From January 1 to April 18,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.540]   you spend that entire time working to pay your taxes.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.880]   On a national basis.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.320]   In Florida, where I live, we have it a little bit better
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.340]   because we don't have a state income tax.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.340]   It's a little better.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.100]   Our Tax Freedom Day is April 15.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.300]   And if you're interested in the actual dates for your state,
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.860]   feel free to click in the show notes
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.060]   and you'll see the link to that PDF with all of the data.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.400]   You know, on average, Americans now spend more time working to pay their taxes
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.460]   than they spend working to provide food and shelter combined.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.060]   And that's a pretty startling statistic.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.460]   Now, the problem is,
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.420]   is that that number is in many ways very misleading.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.100]   And the reason is because that number is based upon a per capita average.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.500]   So basically, you can say the per capita average of tax revenue
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.660]   and taxes paid and divide that among each person.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.680]   That's what per capita means.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.200]   And then that's where it averages out to.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.440]   But that's not true because taxes are not paid proportionately.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.280]   We do not have an average tax rate on each person.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.060]   We don't have a flat tax.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.780]   Our state pays the same percentage of our income.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.480]   And then the tax base upon which taxes are based for each person varies.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.680]   And so you find that some people's Tax Freedom Day is literally January 1.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.320]   And some people's Tax Freedom Day would be later than April 18.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.620]   Taxes are really paid disproportionately by different sectors of society.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.420]   So depending on what tax system we're talking about,
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.320]   for example, income taxes are primarily paid by rich people.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.420]   But payroll taxes,
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.540]   are paid by everybody who earns wages.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.540]   So again, using Heritage Foundation numbers here,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.180]   according to the most recent 2014 numbers I looked up this morning,
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.420]   from the Heritage Foundation,
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:46.820]   the top 10% of earners paid 71% of federal income taxes in 2014.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.200]   Remember that.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.400]   The top 10% of wage earners paid 71% of federal income taxes in 2014.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.380]   Now that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.020]   the wealthiest 10% of the country paid 71% of federal income taxes.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.180]   Federal income taxes are not paid based upon wealth.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.580]   They're paid based upon income.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.080]   It only means that the top earners,
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.920]   the top 10% of earners,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.780]   paid 71% of federal income taxes.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.660]   Also, in all these statistics,
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.420]   anytime you're reading a statistic,
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.140]   and it's pointing out,
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.340]   it's pointing out,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.260]   look at this statistic versus that statistic.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.520]   And you see people on the political left and on the political right,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.540]   everyone bandies about their preferred statistics,
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.580]   and all of them are lying with their statistics.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.720]   A couple things to look for.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.980]   Look at what's being taxed.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.140]   Look at the tax base.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.080]   Look at the tax rates.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.480]   Understand.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.040]   Look at, is your data, is it household data,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.880]   or is this per capita data?
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.440]   Because household data and per capita data are very, very different.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.080]   And you need to always pay attention to that.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.900]   I won't go into that in depth at some point,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.500]   but there are a couple of economists I'd like to interview
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.780]   and bring on at some point to talk about that,
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.020]   because that's a very meaningful,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.140]   very important difference when you're reading statistics.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.600]   I believe tax planning is going to affect,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.440]   should affect just about every decision that you make.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.520]   And usually, people are relatively ignorant about tax planning.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.960]   And usually, people just don't know.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.100]   You don't know what you don't know.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.380]   But why should you pay attention to it?
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.880]   Well, first of all, you're going to make more money.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.980]   And you're going to have more money to spend,
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.420]   because smart tax planning can allow you to increase your income
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.860]   and your investment returns by really up to one third.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.940]   So, you're going to have more money to spend.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.

[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.740]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.540]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.540]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.540]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.540]   And you're going to have more money to invest.

[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:22.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:24.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:26.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.940]   And you're going to have more money to invest.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.940]   And so some people would say,
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.940]   you're better off using a Roth IRA
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.940]   because you're going to go ahead and incur the income now
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.940]   because you're going to go ahead and incur the income now
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.940]   under your higher tax base at the current tax rate.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.940]   But down the road, you won't have to recognize that income.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.940]   But down the road, you won't have to recognize that income.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.940]   So we're going to bring that income forward
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.940]   because we think that the tax rate is going to be higher down the road.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.940]   because we think that the tax rate is going to be higher down the road.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.940]   If the tax base and the tax rate
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940]   under Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.940]   are identical,
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.940]   if I have $100,000 of income now
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:10.940]   and $100,000 of income in retirement
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.940]   and the tax rate is 15% now
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.940]   and the tax rate is 15% in retirement,
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:16.940]   financially they are identical
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.940]   from a tax perspective.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.940]   But if I know what my base is going to be
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940]   or what the rates are going to be,
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.940]   then we can kind of figure out which is better.
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.940]   then we can kind of figure out which is better.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.940]   Now the problem is we don't usually know.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.940]   We don't know what the tax base is going to be
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.940]   and we don't know what the tax rate is going to be.
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940]   And so you'll often find if people believe that tax rates are going to go up,
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.940]   then you'll often find them saying,
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.940]   get a Roth IRA.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.940]   Or if people say that the tax rate is going to go up,
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.940]   and the tax rates are going to go down,
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.940]   then we would know, get a traditional IRA.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.940]   If we knew that our tax base is going to be higher in retirement
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940]   because we're going to be receiving inheritance income
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.940]   and trust income, maybe we would adjust that.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.940]   So it's hard to know.
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.940]   We're basically guessing.
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.940]   But we're making maybe educated guesses
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.940]   or we're going based upon internal biases
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940]   and assumptions.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.940]   Or we're going on something else.
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   So for example, a Roth IRA is much more flexible
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.940]   than a traditional IRA
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.940]   and that may outweigh some of
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.940]   maybe a potential tax consequence.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.940]   Or if we're in a state that we don't have
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.940]   a high state income tax,
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.940]   let's say that we're in Florida,
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.940]   and I don't have to worry about state income taxes,
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.940]   this would be different than if I were living in California,
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.940]   and I wanted to avoid the state income tax on that money,
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.940]   and then I would go ahead and pick it up
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.940]   when I moved to Florida to a state with no income taxes.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940]   So that would be an example of timing.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940]   So either bringing income forward
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940]   or pushing income back.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940]   Or sometimes we're bringing deductions forward
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.940]   or pushing deductions back.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.940]   And this would be especially applicable
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.940]   in the case of a state with no income taxes.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.940]   So we're going to be using business
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.940]   when we're using a business entity,
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940]   whether we deduct this now or deduct it later,
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.940]   but it's also applicable for individuals.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.940]   The second basic technique is going to be income shifting.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.940]   So can we shift income from a high rate taxpayer
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.940]   to a low rate taxpayer?
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.940]   So in this example, can we set up a business entity
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.940]   where if I want my children
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940]   to benefit economically from my business,
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940]   but I'm at the highest tax bracket,
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.940]   can I set up a business entity
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.940]   where my children are partial owners of the business
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.940]   and therefore we can get them money
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.940]   at a lower bracket?
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.940]   And they're in a lower bracket,
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.940]   so therefore there's less money going to the government.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.940]   Now there are lots of rules.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.940]   There's kiddie tax rules we've got to look out for.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.940]   There's passive activity rules and other things.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940]   But this would be a good example of income shifting.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.940]   Or we could have the idea of conversion.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.940]   And so under conversion,
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.940]   we would basically want to be converting our income
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.940]   from high to low tax rate activities.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.940]   So the example here would be,
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.940]   could I convert my high tax rate activity
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:36.940]   to a low tax rate activity?
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.940]   And so we would basically want to convert
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.940]   our income from high to low tax rate activities.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.940]   So we would convert our income from a tax rate hobby
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.940]   into a low tax rate business.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.940]   So if I'm in the business,
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:48.940]   I don't know, the one that always comes as an example
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.940]   is racehorses.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:52.940]   Owning and buying racehorses could be a hobby
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:54.940]   or it could be a business.
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.940]   And racehorses, horses actually have their own
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.940]   line in the tax code
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.940]   about what's considered a business
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.940]   and what's considered a hobby.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.940]   But if I could transfer one of my,
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.940]   if I could transfer my fishing,
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.940]   if I could transfer my fishing expense,
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.940]   my fishing hobby
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.940]   where I go out every weekend and I go fishing,
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.940]   if I could turn that into a business,
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.940]   either I'm going to be a professional fishing guide
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.940]   or I'm going to be a tournament fisherman
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.940]   and this is how I'm going to earn my money,
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.940]   then I may be able to take that boat expense
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.940]   and convert it from a high tax rate hobby
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:26.940]   where I pay for the $50,000 or $100,000 boat
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.940]   with post tax dollars
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.940]   into a deductible expense
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.940]   where I can now use the business tax code
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.940]   and have it be an expended,
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.940]   a qualified business expense.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:38.940]   So lots of rules governing all of these things,
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.940]   but conceptually,
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.940]   all tax planning is going to come down
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.940]   to either a timing strategy,
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.940]   an income shifting strategy,
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.940]   or some kind of conversion strategy.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.940]   Now, in the future, we're going to be going through
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:52.940]   a lot more of this information in the future
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:54.940]   and there's going to be substantial
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.940]   substantial development
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:58.940]   that we're going to do as time goes on
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.940]   on these concepts.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.940]   But hopefully this sets the foundation
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.940]   for teaching through some of these ideas.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.940]   Here's the key with tax planning.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:08.940]   You don't know what's applicable to you
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.940]   until you actually look through each of the things
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:12.940]   that are applicable to you.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.940]   If you're not interested in boating,
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.940]   that idea is not going to work.
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.940]   But if you are interested in boating,
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.940]   that may work.
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.940]   In everything, there are lots and lots of rules
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.940]   that have to be followed.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.940]   So what is considered a qualified business expense,
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:28.940]   what is considered not,
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.940]   these are major things and everything has its own
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.940]   small little rules.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.940]   But the laws exist.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.940]   in such a way that you can abide within them,
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.940]   why not?
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:46.940]   why not?
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:50.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.940]   why not?
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:54.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:58.940]   why not?
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:00.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:04.940]   why not?
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:08.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.940]   why not?
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:14.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.940]   why not?
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:18.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:22.940]   why not?
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:24.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.940]   that you can abide within them,
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.940]   why not?
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.940]   And if you just simply arrange your activities in such a way
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.940]   that you can abide within them,
