[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   The following is a conversation with Charles Hoskinson,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.760]   founder of Cardano, co-founder of Ethereum,
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.800]   and a mathematician who's one of the most well-read
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.200]   and knowledgeable people on the technical side
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.600]   of cryptocurrency that I've ever spoken to.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.640]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   Galileo Games, Allform, Indeed, ExpressVPN, and Asleep.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.840]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.040]   As a side note, let me say that Charles
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.360]   is not just a mathematician or cryptocurrency innovator,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.360]   but also a Colorado-based farmer of bison and mushrooms,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.800]   a gamer, a fisherman, and a world traveler.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.760]   When I asked him if he has a nice professional picture
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.240]   of himself, he sent me a picture of him in Mongolia
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.400]   with a hawk on his shoulder,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.620]   meeting the Mongolian president.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.440]   That to me pretty much says it all,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.280]   speaking to the humor and the intelligence
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.520]   of a man who's bold, innovative,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000]   and does not shy away from a bit of fun
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and a bit of controversy,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.400]   which makes him a fascinating human being
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.280]   to explore ideas with.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640]   I do wanna say, in terms of ideas,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.580]   that at least to me, cryptocurrency is much bigger
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.940]   than just a way for a few Americans to make a quick buck
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.180]   through meme-driven speculation.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.460]   It is technology that enables freedom from oppression,
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.680]   from suffering in the world, because money is power.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.040]   Mongolia, for example, was a reminder of that for me.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.840]   Next day, after talking with Charles,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.560]   I spoke with Wyeonmi Park, who is a North Korean defector,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.240]   and who spent time in Mongolia, as many defectors do,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.200]   in her and their escape from North Korea.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.920]   Her story, the story of North Korea,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.840]   the story of atrocities throughout the 20th century
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.920]   committed by Hitler, Stalin, and others,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.480]   is a reminder that the world is full of darkness,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.640]   but it is also full of beauty and love,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.960]   and it is a world worth fighting for
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.940]   in every way we know how.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.840]   This is the Lux Friedman Podcast,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.280]   and here is my conversation with Charles Hoskinson.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.040]   Let's start with a fun question.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.520]   If we're living in a simulation,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.260]   what programming language do you think it's written in?
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.200]   And maybe from a software engineering perspective,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.000]   what do you think are some of the design principles
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.360]   that it operates under?
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.040]   - You know, there are a lot of really lovely papers,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.600]   like one came out of MSR, the Autodidactic Universe.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.160]   Did you have a chance to see that?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.000]   Oh, you gotta read it.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.720]   It's like April of '21.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.620]   It's just brand new.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.440]   But basically, the idea is that the universe
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   is like some sort of giant self-learning system
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.480]   that can self-evolve, almost like NOMIC.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.160]   And then you have Wolfram running around saying,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   "Hey, we can come up with these very simple rules,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.120]   "and we can reconstruct all of reality
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.680]   "at some arbitrary point."
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.320]   So I have absolutely no idea what's right.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.600]   I look at it kind of like a formal system,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.840]   and I say, "Well, if you're stuck within the system,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.260]   "it's hard to actually understand
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.640]   "that you're inside the system."
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.920]   You know, it's kind of like an object language
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.320]   to a meta-language.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.800]   You know, there's this thing that is outside of it,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.740]   but because you're constrained and limited by the simulation
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.160]   you can't really understand the nature of the thing
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.800]   that's outside of it.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.040]   It's almost like Minecraft.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.920]   You can build these redstone computers within Minecraft
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.620]   and simulate and emulate things within it,
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.440]   but you really can't go outside of that environment.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.120]   - The people outside of it can formally prove
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.780]   that it's correct or whatever,
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.720]   but the creatures inside of the system
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.320]   can't hope to perfectly understand it
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.840]   and prove something about it.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.880]   - Well, also, the question is, it's a computation question.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.280]   You know, does P equal NP?
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   'Cause you'd have to be able to emulate all of these.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   - Yeah, how long will it take?
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.840]   And so I have no clue what type of language
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.160]   it would have to look like,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.060]   but it would probably not be anything
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.360]   we're used to at the moment.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.560]   It'd have to be something else.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.680]   It would have to have some more fundamental resolution
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.800]   of the relationship of these formal systems
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.240]   and how they get extended.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.480]   So that's like a 22nd century question
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.720]   instead of a 21st century.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840]   - Do you find the Stephen Wolfram idea compelling?
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.480]   It's a very different way of programming,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.160]   which is you set some rules,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.500]   you set some initial conditions,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.120]   and let it run and see what happens.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.600]   - Yeah, and it's not a new concept.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.200]   I mean, like the Santa Fe Institute's
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.600]   been doing that for a long time,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.780]   and you can use it for economic modeling,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.640]   and you can show that in certain cases,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.320]   there's this concept of simple rules
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.160]   evolving into a complex system
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.240]   is somewhat more predictive
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.480]   than trying to build a complex top-down model for things.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.880]   And I guess there's some analogies to these things in AI,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.520]   where you start with some simple things,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   and then somehow it just figures stuff out
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920]   in its environment over time,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.760]   and much better than if you actually tried to model it
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.720]   with Prolog or something like that.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   So that is exciting because you get to just do a few things,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.080]   let the thing run, and then see what happens.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.960]   And that's a lot of fun.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.440]   In fact, it got so exciting, Wolfram came to us,
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   and he said, "Hey, let's do an NFT marketplace."
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.280]   And I said, "What do you wanna do?"
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   And he said, "I got all these universes to sell."
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.200]   (Lex laughing)
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.640]   I said, "Okay, well, that's gonna be fun."
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.120]   So we're gonna set up an auction system
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.280]   or something like that with him,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.000]   and I think maybe end of this month or next month,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.800]   we'll figure out how to do NFTs on Cardano
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.520]   with Wolfram universes.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.840]   So as soon as we can sell one, I'll give you one,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.320]   and then we can all just claim
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.680]   that we're living in some sort of Wolfram simulation.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.120]   - I don't know how much money I have,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   but I'm gonna give everything I have to get Rule 30,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.200]   which is one of his universes that he's created,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.520]   one of the first ones where he discovered
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.240]   some interesting complexities.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.920]   - I think Rule 30's Turing Complete, or is that 45?
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.560]   I can't remember which one.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.680]   - You know your stuff.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.160]   Actually, I'm not sure if they proved anything
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.280]   about Rule 30 in terms of whether it's Turing Complete
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.920]   or not, but there's fun competitions on it,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.080]   which is trying to predict something about Rule 30,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.280]   about the way it evolves,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.440]   and so far, nobody's been able to do it.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.320]   Just like looking at the middle column,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.500]   try to predict as the system evolves,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.480]   say anything conclusive about the future
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.920]   of the system as it evolves.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.880]   It's fascinating.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.560]   It's both beautiful that simple rules
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.600]   can create that kind of complexity,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   and it's also sad that we can't make perfect sense of it,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.880]   like perfectly predict the future.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.240]   Even though it's all simple and deterministic,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.760]   we can't say something conclusive
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.240]   about when the thing will end.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   When will this little cellular automata
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.680]   evolve in a certain way,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   and then nuclear weapons will be invented,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.240]   and they blow each other up,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.440]   and then it'll just be this empty 1D cellular automata.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.120]   - Well, doesn't that make it fun, though?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.160]   (Lex laughs)
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   - Yeah, it's fun, but when you're trying to create,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   and we'll talk about something that operates the economy
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.000]   and the way humans transact and cooperate
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.360]   and fall in love and work together,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.160]   then you'd like to be a little bit more formal
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.760]   and try to say something conclusive.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.880]   If this entire universe is just cellular automata,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.440]   then being conclusive is kind of hopeless,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.920]   generally speaking, and the hope is, I guess,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   that there'll be pockets within the cellular automata
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   where you could be predictive,
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.920]   where you can formally show that something is true,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.560]   and then you can rely on that.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.360]   You'll be resilient and all those kinds of things,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.680]   even though the rest of the thing
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.440]   is a giant mess that's unpredictable.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.120]   - Didn't they call that Laplace's demon?
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.960]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.480]   - Well, I wonder what the demon's up to these days.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.400]   Okay, thank you for entertaining me with that.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.160]   But sticking on philosophy, you've also mentioned,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.680]   among others, that Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.860]   are two of your favorite philosophers.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.040]   Maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.760]   you find insightful, and also, what to you is the difference
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.280]   because you're both an engineer and a thinker,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.480]   so what to you is the difference
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.640]   between philosophy and computer science?
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.960]   - Yeah, so yeah, there's both a deeply human element
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.400]   to both Russell and Saul, and then there's this,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.200]   of course, amazing work that they did
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.920]   in the late 19th and 20th century.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.360]   And you can't really talk about Russell or Saul
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.840]   without also mentioning Wittgenstein and Tarski,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.800]   because when you actually look at these guys
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.840]   and you put them together, what they were attempting to do
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.080]   was increase the level of precision we had
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.840]   in analyzing both formal languages
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.960]   and also language in general.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.520]   And so Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.620]   So there's amazing people out there
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.440]   that somehow can parse that, but--
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.240]   - He doesn't make sense to himself either.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.240]   - I think you're right about that.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   However, Kripke has Kripkenstein, you know?
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.520]   He has his whole building on that, right?
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.800]   And he built a whole hierarchy.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.600]   And at least there, I have modal logic,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.420]   and I have the little boxes, and I have the diamonds,
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.700]   and I can do a computation, and I can kind of reason
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.540]   about things that people are saying.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.240]   But really, it was all just about precision
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.160]   and the nature of truth, precision,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.000]   and the nature of necessity and possibility.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.520]   And the magic of these statements is that
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.480]   you can then start getting a better understanding
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.120]   of basically how far formal language can take you.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.760]   And so that's the work of it.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.720]   You know, David Hilbert also did the same thing.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.760]   And Russell, he got his career started
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.120]   working with Alfred North Whitehead.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.480]   He was a logician, and there was this whole desire
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.660]   in late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.760]   in a completely new and better way.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.960]   And they started with geometry,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.560]   and Hilbert's geometry was like a complete system,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.240]   although recently we've discovered
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.520]   there's a few holes in that.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.180]   But for the most part, it's complete,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.440]   and the axioms are independent, and they're consistent.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.960]   And they said, "Oh, well, now we can do this
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.080]   "for all of mathematics."
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.640]   And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of books,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.920]   like two big books, "Principia Mathematica,"
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.200]   1,000 pages, and the conclusion's one plus one equals two.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.840]   So they linked set theory and arithmetic and logic
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.400]   all in these beautiful ways.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.280]   Then, little by little, as we entered the 20th century,
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.560]   logicians started chipping away at this idea
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.640]   that you could actually construct
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.940]   a complete system of mathematics,
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.200]   first with Gödel, and then later with the work of Turing
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.440]   and Church and others.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.040]   They said, "Oh, you're not complete, you're not decidable."
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.940]   And so suddenly, Russell was left in this really bad
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.220]   position where his early life's work
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.200]   was basically forgotten.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.800]   So he had to kind of reinvent himself.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.060]   And so he went into ethics,
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.600]   and he went into different fields of philosophy,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   and he became this titan in analytic philosophy.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.000]   And he was also a great pacifist,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.400]   and he was just a phenomenal writer.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.880]   If you read "Why I'm Not a Christian"
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.920]   or any of his other attacks on metaphysics,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.360]   he said, "Look, I can only deal with the world I'm in
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.020]   "in the senses that I have, and if I can deduce it,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.860]   "I believe it.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.180]   "If it's outside of that,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.880]   "I really can't make meaningful statements about it."
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.240]   And he said it in a lovely English prose
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.200]   that you would expect of a man of his stature.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.220]   Now, Sol Cryptri, it was like the complete opposite.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.520]   This guy's really down-to-earth dude,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.880]   not aristocratic at all.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.640]   And he was one of those guys
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.240]   that just could have done anything,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.040]   'cause he's so brilliant.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.120]   I guess he's still alive.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.240]   - I think he's 80-something.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.080]   Yeah, he's getting up there, man.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.000]   But I mean, literally, when he was in high school,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.680]   he wrote these papers in "Logic,"
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.100]   and Harvard contacted him and said,
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.080]   "Hey, could you teach graduate courses at Harvard?"
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.280]   And he said, "No, I really would like
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.360]   "to finish high school first
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.840]   "before I go and teach grad school at Harvard."
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.380]   And so this is just one of those guys
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.360]   that you can see through his work
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.120]   that he can think deeply about anything.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.160]   He's like the Galois of philosophy.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.880]   And he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.680]   that Tarski and others couldn't resolve.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.140]   He said, "Let's really get serious
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.180]   "about the nature of truth.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.520]   "Let's really try to resolve paradoxes.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.780]   "Let's really try to build things in such a way
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.780]   "that the work that we leave behind
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.400]   "can actually be built upon,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.640]   "and it's not thrown away every 50 years or 100 years."
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.840]   And it was the same for Tarski.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.340]   He comes in, he says, "We mathematicians
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.180]   "love this concept of truth,
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.460]   "but yet we've never really created
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.360]   "a nice rigorous definition that doesn't have paradoxes
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.520]   "embedded inside of it."
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.120]   So he had to invent meta languages and object languages,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.800]   all these notions and so forth.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.400]   So I really like those four, if you think about them.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.980]   And there's a lot of great lessons.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.960]   And where it's relevant today is,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.400]   you have human beings and you have computers,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.960]   and they're trying to understand each other.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.640]   And computers live in the formal world,
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.960]   and human beings live in the natural language world.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.240]   And those bridges between those two
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.880]   are still not completely clear.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.100]   And so a lot of the work that these guys were doing
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.260]   in the 20th century and 19th century
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.120]   had nothing at all to do with that,
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.980]   but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.980]   between those two worlds.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.940]   And maybe there are some nice tools
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.540]   for that bridge to be built upon,
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.040]   and maybe that in some way will allow computers
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.020]   to better understand us.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.100]   I mean, they've even created languages,
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.740]   natural spoken languages that are completely ambiguity-free,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.740]   like Lojban and things like that.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.100]   - What? - Yeah, right?
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.500]   - Wait, what? - L-O-J-B-A-N, Lojban.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.220]   It's based on a language called Loglan,
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.660]   and it's a spoken language that's equivalent
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.340]   to first-order predicate calculus.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.180]   - Oh, interesting, so no ambiguities,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.640]   it's logically consistent.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.300]   - Yeah, Lojban.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.100]   - But can you still have fun in it?
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.620]   - You can get very-- - Can you write poetry?
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.820]   - Yeah, there's people who actually write poetry
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.460]   in Lojban. - I'm gonna switch to that
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.140]   and start tweeting in it. - Yeah, there you go.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.900]   So there's a lot there,
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.120]   and they're just fun to study and think about.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.060]   And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.820]   you'll spend way, way too much time,
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.020]   and there's diminishing returns.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.220]   Now, the second question you asked
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.580]   was one on theoretical computer science
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.740]   to, I guess, engineering. - Philosophy, no, no, no.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.860]   So first step, you said humans and computers.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.500]   So theoretical computer science is theory of the computer,
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.420]   and philosophy is the theory of the human.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.520]   And then we can dissect different stuff about the computer,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.380]   but in terms of these two worlds
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.260]   of the theory of the human, which is philosophy,
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.780]   and the theory of the computer, which is computer science,
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.540]   what do you think is the difference?
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.360]   Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.020]   what is going to be the biggest challenge?
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.780]   Like, can we formalize love?
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.260]   Can we formalize music, art, poetry, all that kind of stuff?
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.000]   Or is that human nonsense that we need to get rid of?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.740]   - No, I don't think it's human nonsense at all.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.940]   I mean, there's even attempts
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.340]   to create algorithmically generated music.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.380]   And the question is,
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.660]   is love just strictly a chemical phenomena,
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.660]   or is there something metaphysical about it,
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.020]   or transcendent of some sort of formal system?
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.620]   I mean, computer science is just saying,
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.840]   hey, we have this notion of computing.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.020]   We have this brain that we've constructed,
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.220]   this formal system that we've built,
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.340]   and given that we have it, what can we do with it?
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.460]   And so some people worry about the roots
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.940]   of the tree of knowledge,
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.060]   the great Yggdrasil of computer science.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.180]   They worry about the roots and say,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.060]   how far can we grow them,
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.820]   and let's keep adding these new models of computation.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.540]   And other people worry about the trunk of the tree,
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.980]   and some people worry about the leaves of the tree.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.540]   And the more advanced the field gets,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.400]   the closer and closer it gets
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.300]   to the people who constructed it, us.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.580]   We have better image processing.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.980]   We have better ways of handling speech to text,
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.460]   and we have better ways of computers
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.300]   kind of understanding the intent
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.140]   of what a human being is saying.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.460]   And then the question is,
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.740]   well, how will a computer understand love,
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.100]   or poetry, or music?
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.780]   Well, it'll understand it the same way we understand it.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.820]   You have to get a computer to grow up to a point
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.340]   where it can learn the way we learn,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.340]   or as close to it as possible.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.320]   Then you just expose it to the things
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.420]   that we were exposed with,
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.260]   and then at some point,
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.660]   the computer will start creating things.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.060]   So the question is, well, how do you quantify creativity?
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.300]   And I have no clue about that.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.980]   - You make it into an NFT and see how much it sells for.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.340]   (Luke laughs)
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.380]   That's one way.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.220]   - Yeah.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.340]   - But basically, yeah, there's so much of it is subjective.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.340]   And that's a fascinating whole area
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.580]   of that I'm fascinated with is human-robot interaction
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.340]   is how do we create compelling experiences
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.540]   that are subjectively compelling,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.100]   whether it's art, or just two humans talking,
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.420]   or two humans interacting in some kind of way
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.820]   to maximize the richness of the subjective experience.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.980]   And I think that could be an optimization problem
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.820]   that could be solved.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.340]   We're solving it all the time.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.660]   Human civilization is constantly trying to,
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.900]   we're constantly trying to impress each other.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.540]   When we're younger, trying to get laid.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.940]   (Luke laughs)
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.100]   Whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.220]   by all the awesome stuff you do.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.340]   I mean, we're trying to optimize that problem
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.420]   that's purely, for the most part, is subjective.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.580]   - Right, did you ever watch "Blade Runner 2049"?
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.420]   - Yes.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.700]   - Yeah, did you remember the whole relationship
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.180]   between Joy and Kay?
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.740]   Did she really love him, the hologram or not?
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.820]   Was it fake love or real love?
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.660]   - Fake it 'til you make it, is my view on love.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.740]   No comment from Charles.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.580]   So let's go to the difference
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.860]   between theoretical computer science
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.540]   and software engineering.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.820]   Or I don't know if you draw a distinction,
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.200]   but if we look into this computer world now,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.720]   is there a difference between theory,
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.420]   things you can say formally,
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.780]   and the pragmatic implementation of that theory
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.940]   into actual systems that people use?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.780]   - Yeah.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.180]   - Which I guess we'll call software engineering.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.300]   - So the engineer, they're obsessed with the domain of,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.540]   well, what do you want to accomplish
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.280]   and who are you accomplishing it for?
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.500]   So they live in the world of people,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.820]   if they're good engineers.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.700]   And they say, okay, what's the experience?
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.260]   How are we going to use this?
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.700]   Why are we going to use this?
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.260]   What's the commercial application?
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.180]   What's the non-commercial application?
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.300]   And you collect all these business requirements.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.360]   And once you've done all of that,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.480]   the better job you do, the more self-evident it is
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.980]   of how do we apply the toys and tools
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.440]   of computer science and other such things
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.220]   to actually resolve that.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.820]   And the point of theoretical computer science
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.560]   from the software engineering domain
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.100]   is it can tell you kind of where your guardrails are.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.300]   It won't make perfect programs,
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.220]   and there's no such thing as that,
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.960]   but rather it can give you a good notion and sense
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.720]   that your program has some desirable properties.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.320]   Like maybe you can prove that it can terminate
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.960]   if you're dealing with total programs.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.860]   Or maybe you can prove you'll never have a buffer overflow,
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.260]   or it won't divide by zero somewhere,
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.340]   or something like that.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.660]   Some event won't occur that'll cause
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.620]   a catastrophic failure in your system.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.700]   But there's always this combinatorial explosion
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.700]   between what you can test and think about
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.820]   and what you can actually code.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.580]   So the stuff on the left-hand side
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.700]   lives in a different cardinality, a different universe.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.880]   There's something significantly larger there.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.820]   And the tools on the right-hand side,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.620]   we have property-based testing and these SAT solvers.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.740]   We have all this great stuff here in formal methods land
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.580]   and computer science theory land,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.720]   but there's only a small subset of things
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.580]   that they actually give you good answers about.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.220]   So the balance of the two things is basically saying,
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.900]   well, what do you care about
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.920]   and what are you okay throwing away?
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.660]   That's the art of engineering
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.780]   and building these types of things.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.340]   So in cryptocurrencies,
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.840]   we deal with these complex distributed systems
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.000]   that have cryptography and game theory and Byzantine actors.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.980]   So the balance there is saying,
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.840]   okay, what can't fail in that system?
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.260]   And that's the kind of stuff that you want to apply
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.340]   as heavy a tool set as you can,
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.100]   because when that stuff fails,
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.260]   you either have a loss of billions of dollars,
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.580]   privacy, or potentially even life,
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.860]   depending on how these systems get adopted.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.920]   But then other things, what can't fail?
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.340]   Is it okay if the block doesn't get made every now and then?
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.260]   Is it okay if your latency goes up
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.300]   or your network suddenly becomes asynchronous
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.900]   and you disconnect from it
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.420]   and you have to restart the computer or something like that?
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.580]   That's probably okay.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.020]   It's an inconvenience and burden to the user.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.860]   And if you actually try to chase that tail,
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.660]   you'll end up spending 10 years chasing phantoms and ghosts.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.220]   And meanwhile, the whole world moves on.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.280]   So it's really figuring out those balance of the two.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.660]   And what's really beautiful is that the formal methods tools
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.140]   have gotten so much better
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.180]   over the last 20 years in particular,
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.700]   mostly because of incredibly high investments
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.100]   from Microsoft and Google and big universities,
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.940]   'cause these guys are building these gargantuan systems.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.200]   If you look at the Googleplex
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.940]   or what Amazon has or others,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.740]   and they have so much value, so many users,
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.820]   so many things going on,
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.460]   and no person can keep that in their head.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.420]   And so you're talking about systems
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   may have 10 million lines of code,
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.740]   15 million lines of code,
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.840]   millions of nodes connecting,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.600]   faulty processes happening all the time,
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.040]   hackers breaking in on a regular basis.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.020]   So when you're trying to model all of that,
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.220]   you're trying to ask yourself,
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.720]   what formal guarantees and properties can I get
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.400]   to simplify this system as much as possible?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.380]   So instead of the applications of formal methods
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.060]   slowing you down, in many cases,
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.180]   it actually massively reduces your debugging time
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.180]   and your ability to find where errors occur.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.460]   In some cases, you can't find where errors occur
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.380]   inside these massive concurrent systems.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.320]   And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.460]   We're talking about just the same thing,
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.540]   but we're talking about a much more hostile
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.860]   operating environment, where instead of it running
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.780]   in a pristine data center in California somewhere,
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.300]   it's running on your cell phone,
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.500]   it's running on your mom's phone,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.500]   it's running on your dad's phone,
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.340]   it's running on some computer in Mongolia
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.620]   that may have good internet on Tuesday,
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.180]   but not any other day.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.780]   So when you live in that kind of environment,
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.740]   you really do need to think carefully
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.860]   about a whole new class of protocols.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.100]   And then you need to think carefully
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.180]   about a whole new class of tools and techniques
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.540]   to test the reliability of those systems.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.940]   And you need to separate the world and say,
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.140]   what is high assurance and cannot fail?
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.420]   'Cause if it fails, people lose money.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.260]   And what is low assurance and it's okay if that falls apart?
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.540]   The other thing I'll mention is there are
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.340]   perverse financial incentives in our industry.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.780]   Because the reality is when something blows up,
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.580]   the people who built those things that blow up
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.300]   usually get paid up front.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.800]   So what they're focusing on is time to market,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.180]   speed to market, and getting tokens out
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.900]   and getting them liquid.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.100]   I mean, then people come in, they buy it,
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.660]   but if there's a nascent bug in some DeFi protocol,
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.540]   it'll probably be discovered six months later
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.620]   or something like that.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.300]   It blows up, who suffers?
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.140]   The users.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.700]   - They already got, the people that created that
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.540]   already got paid.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.980]   - Exactly, that's why you pay the guy
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.900]   who makes the break software for your train last.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.260]   And you make sure he rides the train every day.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.860]   (laughing)
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.820]   - So that's, you're basically describing the complexity
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.540]   of a distributed system that's fundamentally
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.660]   game theoretic and like, if we think about turtles
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.300]   all the way down, it's humans all the way down.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.860]   So I mean, at the very bottom is still human nature.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.620]   Is there something you can say
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.220]   formally about human nature to try,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.100]   you said you can't, there's certain parts of the system
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.400]   that can't fail.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.500]   You know, some people talk about nuclear war
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.800]   in that same kind of way.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.180]   That there's this game theoretic construction
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.980]   of mutually assured destruction.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.140]   Oh, that rhymes.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.180]   See, I'm a poet.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.920]   That system can't fail 'cause you're gonna blow everyone up.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.980]   But you can't formally say for sure it's not going to fail.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.800]   - Right.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.220]   - So like, you're basically trying to chase,
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.180]   like statistically reduce the probability
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.460]   that these particular critical aspects will fail.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.380]   And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.060]   at small scale to see where things go wrong.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.340]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.180]   And you know, the problem with game theory
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.140]   and mechanism design is that you can develop this concept
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.140]   of a rational actor.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.660]   And I don't think in my life I've ever met a rational actor.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.420]   You know, there's a rational actor on Tuesday,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.060]   but any other day of the week, who the hell knows.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.940]   And there's even, I think there was a book, Freakonomics,
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.880]   and there's a few of these things
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.420]   where it just shows again and again
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.560]   where people behave in ways
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.420]   that are against their best interest.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.060]   So then you have these protocol designers,
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.740]   and they say, well, we need an honest majority
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.420]   for this thing to work.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.680]   And they say, oh, okay, well,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.180]   we'll create this incentive model,
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.580]   and rational actors will behave with that incentive model.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.380]   And they say, well, the individual won't do that,
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.960]   but the firm, the government, the entity will.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.220]   The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.260]   where the system was actually behaving in weird ways.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.880]   Like we almost completely eradicated the human population
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.720]   twice in the 20th century,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.400]   once during the Cuban Missile Crisis,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.220]   and again in the 1980s, there was a Russian colonel,
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.220]   and they installed a new satellite system,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.980]   and it said, hey, the Americans
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.160]   are launching missiles at us.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.300]   You need to turn the key and launch all the missiles
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.960]   in the silo, and he said, oh, that's not right.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.440]   That doesn't seem right.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.560]   And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.840]   So in both cases, a single person stood
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.320]   against the systems of superpowers
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.960]   between us and nuclear annihilation.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.360]   So in general, we're really bad
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   at building these types of things.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.080]   So what you look for instead is say,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.120]   can the system be self-correcting?
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.420]   It's not about avoiding a problem.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.380]   It's more about can the problem be resolved?
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.340]   And that's how nature engineers things.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.700]   It gives you an immune system.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.300]   It gives you the ability to heal.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.140]   If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event,
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.520]   the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.220]   So it's a better question of how do you align
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.460]   the incentives over the long term of a system
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.540]   where all the actors within the system,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.860]   when an event occurs that disrupts it,
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.420]   have an incentive to push it back
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.520]   into a healthy, productive, useful state?
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.580]   Which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.260]   that we began with and a little bit about,
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.560]   how do you handle modern economics?
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.160]   Like for example, we knew this coming into the COVID crisis
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.960]   that there would be catastrophic economic disruption
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.060]   throughout the entire world.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.120]   In the developed world, it was print lots of money
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.520]   and hope to God it works.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.060]   In the developing world, it's try not to starve to death.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.400]   Over 100 million people were pushed into acute starvation.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.200]   So acute hunger, it's a terrible situation.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.520]   But every economist knew we were going into that.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.240]   So the question is how do you restart the system?
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   How do you realign the system and so forth
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.180]   and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some point?
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.840]   So it's an imperfect, inexact science.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.280]   And that's actually one of the things
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.040]   that makes our industry so much fun
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.840]   is that these are kind of like micro experiments
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.960]   for the macro.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.760]   In years past, you never got a chance
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.000]   to experiment with monetary policy.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.720]   I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.080]   you'd have some conference usually
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.200]   in a cool island like Jamaica and be like,
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.160]   okay, let's go talk about monetary policy
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.080]   and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.560]   And these would be nation states, invitation only.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.600]   And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.720]   floating around all with their own monetary policy
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.120]   and their rules and it's very Darwinian.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.400]   A lot are dying, some are succeeding.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.720]   Anomalies happen like Dogecoin and you say,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.920]   God, is this temporary?
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.760]   Is this permanent?
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.960]   Why doesn't this horrible thing die?
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.360]   And then other things you think
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.240]   would be absolutely successful
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.360]   and just take off and be in the top 10
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.840]   don't really get as much traction.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.000]   Like Algrand is a great example of that.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.080]   I mean, Silvio, he's an incredibly bright guy.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.920]   Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.840]   and his work is legendary
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.440]   and it's just beautiful and elegant
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.560]   and he literally has all the people.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.320]   He went and hired Tal Robin and she got at IBM Research
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.520]   and Craig Gentry, the guy did homomorphic encryption
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.600]   under Dan Boneh's there.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.960]   There's all these amazing people on that team
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.840]   and they have money in the VCs.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.400]   So you'd say, okay, that's a contender.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.680]   But if you look at market adoption,
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.120]   Ethereum Classic sometimes is above it
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.960]   and other things are above it.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.120]   - And then there's this weird Darwinian evolution
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.320]   produced Dogecoin organism
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.760]   that's just like stomping all around.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.000]   Evolution doesn't make sense.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.520]   - Exactly, but maybe it's we're the problem, not evolution
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.680]   'cause the market's the market
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.800]   and you can scream and cry and pout
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.900]   and stamp your foot and say, this makes no sense.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.800]   But that's the way the world works.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.540]   There's plenty of mountain climbers
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.360]   that didn't want gravity to apply to them
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.840]   and it's the same situation here.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.520]   There's plenty of people in these marketplaces
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.360]   that had the best of intentions, the best team,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.460]   the best technology and for whatever reason,
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.760]   they didn't get that adoption.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.420]   So the question isn't the local,
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.400]   it should be the long-term
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.800]   and will the system over time converge to a state
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.680]   that actually is useful and meaningful to society
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.480]   and actually solve problems for it?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.460]   And that's what we try to figure out
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.820]   is how do we perturb these things in a way
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.820]   to kind of push them in that direction?
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.820]   - So before we go into this fascinating
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.260]   Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.380]   let me ask you sort of a basic programming question.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.140]   There's a fascinating aspect to your work with Cardano
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.140]   that you use Haskell to build the infrastructure,
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.860]   but even stepping back more, looking at this landscape,
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.680]   another place where Darwinian evolution operates,
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.640]   looking at this landscape of programming languages,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.680]   you as an engineer, you as a philosopher,
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.040]   both, what programming languages
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.760]   do you think are interesting?
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.180]   And more practically, what programming languages,
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.040]   if you were to advise students today, should they learn?
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.680]   - Yeah, so there's the pedagogy of learning how to program
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.120]   and to express the theory of computer science.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.960]   Like you have to learn how to write algorithms,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.800]   you have to learn what data structures are,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.940]   you have to be able to do analysis of these things.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.140]   And that probably, I think the debate is over Python
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.140]   is probably the best language or JavaScript
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.140]   to get started with 'cause they're very useful,
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.460]   the libraries are amazing,
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.820]   there's just tons of online materials.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.220]   Even MIT is now teaching their introduction
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.500]   to computer science in Python.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.260]   And they used to do Lisp, I mean,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.340]   these guys were hardcore.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.180]   - I still love Lisp.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.660]   - Oh man, it's great.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.020]   These are your father's parentheses,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.940]   they're elegant weapons from a time long ago.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.700]   But you know, that's a great starting point.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.260]   And it's not about falling in love with a language,
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.980]   it's just falling in love with computing.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.580]   It's about falling in love with having a dialogue
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.260]   with a computer and thinking about,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.480]   well, how would I solve that?
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.860]   How would I interact with that?
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.720]   What does this need to look like?
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.500]   Functional programming is what we've chosen
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.660]   to use for Cardano, mostly because we're living
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.040]   in the academic world, we've written 105 papers.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.380]   And the problem is you have to translate that work
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.020]   into code, and the gap between an imperative language
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.280]   like a C++ or C and these academic rigorous papers
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.220]   is extremely large.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.560]   And so there's gonna be a lot of semantical ambiguity
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.540]   between those two.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.100]   And what I mean by that is that you might end up
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.820]   implementing a wrong thing.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.480]   You might think that what you've built is the paper,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.720]   but the computer's not going to tell you that
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.220]   'cause the paper's written in prose
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.540]   and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.180]   But there's no proof chain, evidence chain
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.340]   that you can show that there's no ambiguity.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.660]   When you look at a functional language,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.540]   you're a little closer to math.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.040]   And so as a consequence, the translation of the papers
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.140]   that we spent so damn long writing and writing proofs about
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.420]   and so forth to code is much smaller.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.260]   Now, the downside is these functional languages
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.660]   tend to be a bit more academic,
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.620]   and they tend to have not necessarily
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.180]   the best Windows support and the libraries aren't so good.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.900]   And also they tend to be a little slower
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.380]   when compared as a whole on average
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.980]   to languages like C, for example.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.780]   So it's really a question of, okay,
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.060]   what are you designing for for version one?
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.140]   Are you designing for performance?
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.980]   And are you designing for developer accessibility?
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.100]   Are you designing for correctness?
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.100]   And are you designing for a high-fidelity representation
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.820]   of the protocol?
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.100]   Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.140]   because we knew that the kinds of people
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.340]   who think about that are also the kinds of people
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.580]   that would have an easy time reading a paper like Ouroboros
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.420]   and working their way through all of this.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.180]   And they would do a pretty good job
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.020]   running a formal specification
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.620]   and then translating that into running code.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.820]   Then once you have that, you have a blueprint
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.340]   that you can actually reason about, maintain.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.500]   And if you really wanted to,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.820]   you could then turn that into a Rust code base
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.620]   or into a Java code base.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.580]   Going the other way around would be
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.900]   kind of pointless and counterproductive.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.480]   The other side of it is that Haskell code
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.060]   or functional code tends to be
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.580]   significantly more concise.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.980]   And I actually have a real life example of that.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.060]   So if you take a look at Mantis,
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.900]   we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.100]   It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.380]   You compare that with like C++ Bitcoin,
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.580]   I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.660]   So it's almost 10 times smaller.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.100]   And so less code, less to read.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.180]   And you tend to read code significantly more
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.540]   than you would read, write code.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.300]   So it's always an advantage for maintenance,
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.820]   understandability, documentation, and other sort of things
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.980]   when you have more concise code bases.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.180]   And also it's a lot easier for you to apply
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.100]   stronger tools to a functional code base,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.620]   like static analysis or property-based testing
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.320]   or these types of things than an imperative code base.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.500]   But you know, the thing is, it's almost like a religion.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.860]   It's like, or language.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.100]   It's like saying, what's French versus Russian
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.940]   versus English.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.060]   Everybody has their adherence.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.380]   They say, oh, they have the best poetry here.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.620]   - Russian, yeah, wins.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.260]   - There you go, always, Russian.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.940]   Everybody has their favorite tools
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.020]   and their favorite languages,
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.740]   but it just comes down to what problems
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.780]   are you trying to solve
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.220]   and what problem domain do you live in?
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.300]   If you're inventing new protocols based on science,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.140]   you're gonna take the time to write a paper,
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.340]   go through the peer review process,
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.420]   as you've done personally,
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.580]   and you know how hard it can be to get into a conference
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.840]   and go through that and get your ass kicked.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.820]   Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.900]   to the engineering side in terms of the implementation
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.020]   of that, or else you will make a mistake,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.660]   and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.600]   that destroys the security properties of the system.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.020]   So we really had no choice,
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.260]   but to go to some notion of functional.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.580]   The question was, what's the Goldilocks language?
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.500]   Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F# or Clojure,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.400]   where you still have some connection
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.060]   to understandable things like .NET or the JVM?
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.100]   Or do you go to an overly academic language
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.180]   like Idris or Agda or Isabel?
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.140]   And there you can really dial up the correctness
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.820]   and write all kinds of crazy proofs.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.740]   But by the way, it's like the seven people
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.060]   who write your code, they go on vacation a lot,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.660]   you'll never get anything done.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.340]   So Haskell kind of felt like a nice middle ground
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.180]   between those two,
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.980]   where if we needed to pull into the left, we could.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.300]   If you wanted to pull into the right, you could as well.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.020]   That said, it's really amazing to see
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.500]   what the hybrid languages have done.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.540]   If I was a new student in computer science
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.860]   and I said, learn any language to grow your career from,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.140]   Scala 3 is probably the language to go with.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.980]   - Interesting.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.220]   - Yeah, it's great, 'cause it's like,
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.980]   you want it to be like Java, it's Java.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.660]   And it looks kind of like a Java program.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.780]   You want it to be like Python and scripted
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.940]   and you reuse a REPL, you can do that.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.500]   You wanna go hardcore dot, dependent object types
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.060]   and do like weird proofs and stuff in the functional,
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.100]   you do all that.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.880]   You have access to all of these things.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.700]   And Martin Odersky is a brilliant guy.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.260]   He's done some phenomenal work, basically,
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.380]   'cause he was one of the guys who created the JVM
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.380]   and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.620]   He did a lot of really hardcore work
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.060]   in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.860]   that does a little bit of everything.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.540]   And it's got great applications in data science and in AI.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.220]   It's also heavily used in modern companies,
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.600]   like Netflix uses Scala
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.460]   for all of their microservice architecture.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.300]   - Interesting.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.740]   - Yeah, so that's a great language.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.060]   And it's easy to pick up
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.700]   and it's easy to hire people into it.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.420]   You just find these Eastern European guys
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.540]   who were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years,
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.900]   and they got tired of making $20 an hour,
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.220]   so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.900]   And they're really good at it.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.380]   And that's a great gateway drug
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.380]   'cause you have like QuickCheck and Haskell,
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.260]   you have ScalaCheck and Scala.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.260]   You can also do model checking.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.620]   You can also go and use a TLA spec
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.020]   and make it work with Scala and so forth.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.680]   So it gets you a little bit of everything.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.880]   And you can then move around that entire design space
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.900]   in a beautiful way.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:05.680]   - So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go vanilla,
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.400]   you go Python and JavaScript.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.240]   - When you're getting started.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.080]   - It's the getting started.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.960]   - 'Cause that'll get you everything.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.880]   You can do web scrapers and anything.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.800]   It's just fun. - Like all of us
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.600]   experiment with drugs in undergrad.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.520]   This was where Scala 3 comes in.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.320]   It's a gateway drug to then potentially
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.380]   more hardcore functional languages like Haskell.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.240]   Do you think C and C++ still have as a role?
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.200]   - No, I think Rust is completely replaced
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.020]   the need for them.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.120]   Go and Rust, those are the two twins of Doom.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.360]   I mean, Google created Go just to get rid of C.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.720]   They hated C that much.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.400]   And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as well.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.240]   - Hate can be a great motivator.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.960]   Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.480]   We're going depth first today.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.720]   As a developer, why should I be incentivized
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.080]   to create Cardano-based applications?
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.520]   What is on the Cardano developer roadmap?
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.760]   Any other language, I guess this is the key question
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.640]   I wanna ask, any other language support other than Haskell?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.360]   The example this person gives us,
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.320]   TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, et cetera.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.600]   Also, have you considered a yearly conference
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.740]   focused around developers?
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.200]   - Yeah, we call it PlutusFest.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.800]   And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can't remember.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.400]   And we were gonna do one last year, but then COVID hit.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.500]   So we'll bring it back and we'll probably do it annually
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.160]   at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.040]   In fact, it just so happens that coincides
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.000]   with the Goguen Summit.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.120]   So we're doing that, I think the third week of September.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.880]   But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.480]   You can bring a lot of cool people together
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.760]   and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.480]   But to the question in particular,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.560]   Plutus is like any other language.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.040]   Plutus Core, you can compile things into it.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.600]   So it's entirely possible to write a Scala
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.160]   to Plutus Core compiler or TypeScript compiler
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.360]   or something like that.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.320]   But I'm a big believer of separation of concerns.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.680]   And we don't live in a single chain model anymore.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.000]   So you have a situation where you probably wanna have
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.640]   different execution environments in different chains.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.240]   So you have different virtual machines there.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.560]   And that's why we work so closely
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.480]   with the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.400]   Gregori Roshu's team at Runtime Verification.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.360]   What they did is they said,
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.800]   let's start with something very familiar, LLVM,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.400]   which has been around for a really long time
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.360]   and they happened to have created it there with Apple.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.440]   And let's take that and translate that
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.080]   into the blockchain space.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.000]   Okay, then once you have it,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.040]   then it's very easy to modify compilers
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.720]   of standard languages like the Cs and C++s
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.760]   and other such things that do compile to LLVM already
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.040]   and have them run there.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.640]   So that's a different execution model
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.200]   than what we tried to build for Plutus,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.280]   which focuses on correctness.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.800]   Okay, so then all you have to really do is say,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.280]   can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.120]   'Cause then you kind of, and I did a video,
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.040]   it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.880]   And the basic idea was say,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.720]   you have an island where everything's perfect.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.920]   Calypso lives there, life is great.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.400]   People feed you grapes every day,
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.840]   but maybe you can't do everything on the island.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.480]   The ocean's big, it has everything,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.080]   but the ocean's got sea monsters and sharks
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.280]   and Boaty McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.000]   So that's what Yella is about.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.760]   It's basically this, let's bring LLVM into our world
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.640]   and at some point in the next three to five year
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.320]   time horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in,
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.400]   but they're gonna come in with all their flaws
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.240]   and their warts and their problems.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.320]   And then the pond was the idea
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.600]   of the Ethereum virtual machine.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.160]   There's some network effect around it
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.280]   and there's some great tooling
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.040]   that's materialized and evolved.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.520]   And it's not clear if that's the standard yet
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.640]   or if like MySpace or BlackBerry
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   or all these other things, it'll fade away.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.840]   Well, if it becomes the standard, okay,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.920]   don't fight nature, just support it.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.640]   And the same thing that gives you the ability
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.760]   to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.400]   to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.880]   and they're encapsulated, bulk-headed, separated systems,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.160]   but you can move ADA applications information
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.840]   between those two systems.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.720]   And so your main chain will always stay
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.440]   somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.280]   of expressiveness required on it
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.840]   to do all kinds of interesting things.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.200]   And also for interoperability, be able to talk
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.880]   to all kinds of interesting things,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.080]   but it's not trying to be everything to everyone.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.120]   There's never gonna be an ice cream store in the island.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.800]   You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.440]   but no ice cream.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.680]   - Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.800]   So just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.400]   for the record, what is Plutus?
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.760]   - So Plutus is a programming language.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.520]   It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.000]   And basically we wrote it after spending about three years
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.040]   thinking about all smart contracts.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.840]   We were trying to figure out like,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.440]   what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.280]   And then we started thinking, well,
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.400]   what is a smart contract?
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.680]   Is it the whole application or is it just like a sub module
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.920]   within an application?
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.080]   And usually it's the latter more than the former.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.800]   You can build a self-contained program like a script,
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.600]   but usually what's happening is you'll have it
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.680]   or something like that.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.600]   You say, hey, maybe I want to actually create gold
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.840]   in World of Warcraft that's actually a currency.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.720]   Okay, so I'm gonna issue a token.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.620]   Well, and then maybe I want to create some mechanics
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.320]   behind how people are gonna trade that amongst each other.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.580]   So that would be like a smart contract layer
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.960]   and issue an asset.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.300]   So you have this centralized server running
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.860]   and proprietary software controlled by a single company,
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.460]   but then you've opened your application up
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.920]   to a broader world.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   And what you've done now is added a blockchain layer
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.120]   and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.480]   and the spending policy of that stuff.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.460]   So that is a much smaller program
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.780]   than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.360]   So the point of Plutus was let's create a language
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.720]   where you can write these small to mid-sized programs
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.240]   and have a high degree of confidence
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.200]   that they behave with correctness.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.840]   And also they give you deterministic results
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.160]   on the consumption of resources.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.900]   You can run things locally and you actually understand
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.880]   what it costs to run.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.200]   And that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.700]   If you dial up the expressiveness of the system
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.080]   and like Ethereum does
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.680]   and these big mutable account systems,
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.320]   the problem is you have to have global state.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.000]   So whatever you test locally
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.280]   doesn't actually necessarily translate
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.240]   to what you've deployed.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.000]   So we spent a long time asking,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.560]   where's the Goldilocks zone?
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.080]   Bitcoin script was too restrictive
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.600]   and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.160]   it led to mega problems.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.200]   Like there was a beautiful thing
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.800]   called the value overflow incident in 2010,
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.440]   which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.680]   They had to quickly clean that up and sweep it under the rug
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.360]   and pretend like it didn't exist.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.680]   But that was mostly because of an issue
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.280]   with how the scripting language was implemented.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.040]   And when you look at Ethereum,
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:48.000]   it's like this pure game of stomping down these skirmishers
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.280]   where every update there's something
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.640]   they have to change or tune.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.080]   And then it's not clear how you shard such a model.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.560]   So we said, let's build something
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.880]   that's in the middle of this.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.560]   And that's what Plutus basically is.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.040]   And it's really designed to play very nicely
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.400]   with off-chain infrastructure
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.280]   as much as on-chain infrastructure.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.960]   So you can look at all those different examples,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.880]   whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.000]   their universes or Blizzard wants to issue
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.440]   an in-game currency or you're Uber
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.680]   and you want to start putting peer-to-peer dynamics
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.760]   inside your system, you're going to gracefully connect
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.680]   to that on-chain code.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.080]   And it's very clear how those two things connect together.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.600]   Just so happens Haskell is really good for this.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.720]   They have template Haskell and it makes it very easy
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.000]   to embed domain-specific languages.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.320]   And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.160]   onto off-chain infrastructure.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.960]   So in the future, you'll be able to have your off-chain
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.240]   run a node or the Java virtual machine
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   or a .NET application, and there'll just be
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.240]   this beautiful interface and then it can talk
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   to all your on-chain code.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.920]   And that's written in that DSL
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.280]   and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.240]   - Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.040]   that reveals the beauty of this balance
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.160]   that you're referring to?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.960]   Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.000]   - Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.840]   actually today 'cause we just--
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.920]   - Yeah, I heard about this.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.600]   But there you'd want to have the whole round trip.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.360]   So you'd like to have an interaction.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.480]   And I think a video game would probably show it the best.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.360]   Like if we could reimplement CryptoKitties
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.840]   or something like that on it,
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.400]   and you have this off-chain infrastructure
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.840]   and you have your GUI in your front end,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.120]   it's running on your phone or a browser,
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.240]   and most of that lives off-chain.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   But your CryptoKitties, they'd live on the blockchain.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.080]   The whole round trip end-to-end with relatively low fees
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.040]   and low latency and high availability of service,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.240]   it never goes down.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.000]   That would probably be the best thing to do.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.840]   And we'll have something like that by August.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.200]   It's pretty easy to build this stuff.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.800]   - So what kind of off-chain interactions
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.960]   are supported with Bluetooth?
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.000]   What are the limits you want to put on the thing
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.120]   so it doesn't get chaotic?
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.040]   - That's the beautiful thing.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.240]   When you have a less expressive model on-chain,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.760]   it means you can do anything you want off-chain.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.600]   - So you started talking about smart contracts,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   but let's zoom back out and ask the big question here
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.200]   is what is a blockchain and what is a cryptocurrency?
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   - So a blockchain is just a ledger,
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.880]   and really it has three nice properties.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.280]   You're time-stamped, you're immutable, and auditable,
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.240]   either in a global or a local sense.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.460]   And so there's all kinds of things mankind has invented
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.080]   where it's really important
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.840]   that when you put some information down, it doesn't change,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.200]   and other people can see it,
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.280]   and that you know when it was put down.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.680]   For example, a property ledger.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.000]   So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.040]   like mineral rights or water rights or these things,
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.680]   you'd like to transitively see how does it go
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.400]   from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim and so forth,
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.520]   and what was the state of these things
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.600]   as they were transitioning?
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.280]   So how much did they pay, when did it occur,
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.120]   et cetera, et cetera, the metadata that follows that.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.560]   Okay, well normally these types of ledgers are so important
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.000]   that they're managed either by governments
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.420]   or regulated entities.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.820]   And the issues are that while they can be efficient,
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.960]   they're generally brittle to political manipulation,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.080]   and they're brittle to geopolitical events.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.520]   For example, when Syria fell apart,
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.520]   the very first thing ISIS did is they started saying,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.560]   "Hey, the ownership of the land,
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.300]   "it's gonna fundamentally change.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.560]   "We've decided that this guy over here now
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.680]   "owns all these things."
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.580]   And then when peace comes, how do you unwind all of that,
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.440]   put it all back together?
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.240]   So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.080]   a transnational way of sorting all these details out,
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.640]   putting it all together in a place that you know
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.320]   that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor,
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.640]   that it will still stay preserved.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.760]   This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.840]   Usually kings and empires,
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.260]   they have the ability to decide what's true.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.400]   And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.000]   that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.840]   and once something goes in there,
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.540]   you know that that's there, okay?
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.780]   So that's the first part of it.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.500]   The second part of it is that it's auditable,
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.680]   meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.240]   or the president or some very special club of people
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.940]   get to see what's going on,
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.780]   suddenly now all the people can actually see
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.280]   who owns what where.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.040]   Like imagine a tax system where the ProPublica
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.080]   just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.000]   and said, "Well, how much do they make
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.320]   "and how much do they pay?"
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.680]   Well, imagine a tax system where that's just done by default
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.760]   or other social systems where this type of information
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.180]   is put in by default.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.800]   So it's tremendously useful, this type of structure
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.740]   and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.440]   Just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot,
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.040]   I've been to 52 countries in the last five years.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.400]   Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.940]   You know, I get hit by a car or something
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.300]   and I'm unconscious and a Zimbabwean doctor
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.920]   calls my doctor in Colorado and says,
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.600]   "Hey, I need all of Charles's medical records.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.560]   "He's unconscious right now,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.360]   "but I need it to treat him 'cause he's quite ill."
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.740]   They'd say, "Who is this person in Zimbabwe?
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.720]   "I don't know you, I can't give you his records.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.560]   "I need his consent."
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.200]   "Oh no, he's unconscious in the hospital, can't do it."
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.280]   Well, a broker system that would allow the movement
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.800]   of medical records would be an example
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.440]   of what a blockchain could potentially do
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.840]   in the foreseeable future.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.680]   Cryptocurrency is just an application
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.280]   that runs on top of blockchain 'cause it turns out
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.480]   that when you issue property,
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.860]   you also can issue tokens of value.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.440]   And then you could have a monetary policy,
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.680]   it could be inflationary or deflationary,
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.080]   gonna demorize where it decays over time
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.280]   or whatever have you.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.920]   And the very same mechanics that would ensure
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.480]   your property records are secure,
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.440]   your medical record access is secure,
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.160]   could also be applied for the ownership
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.200]   of the cryptocurrency.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.800]   And again, you can either be completely transparent
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.240]   and everybody can see what everybody owns
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.640]   and that's what Bitcoin does,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.240]   or you can be as opaque as you seek to be.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.400]   That's what Zcash basically attempts to do.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.640]   It says, "Hey, let's keep these things
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.080]   "as private as possible."
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.720]   But they have relatively the same mechanics
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.660]   in terms of those properties of auditability
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.680]   and timestamping and immutability.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.380]   You know things won't be reversed,
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.800]   you know that people aren't gonna manipulate the timestamps
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.440]   and you can audit at least enough to know
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.200]   that the ownership is right.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.480]   - But the way, if you think about physics and the universe,
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   the universe has figured out a way to update
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.360]   the ledger of physics in a way where like a lot of people
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.080]   can be updating it and it stays consistent.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.660]   Is there something you can say about the task
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.920]   of updating the ledger when a bunch of people
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.760]   are trying to do it,
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.320]   or a bunch of entities are trying to do it?
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.160]   - Well, yeah, that's the whole point
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.240]   of a consensus algorithm.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.240]   So whatever ledger you're running,
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.040]   there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.680]   And that's what proof of work does
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.800]   and proof of stake does and all these other systems.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.840]   And you break them down to basically three steps.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.560]   And so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.080]   Hi Eve, how you doing?
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.320]   And we're gonna use Wally for step number two.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.140]   And I need the monkey, give me the monkey.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.000]   What's the monkey's name?
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.840]   - Daisy.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.960]   - Daisy the monkey, okay.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.360]   I like Daisy.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.600]   Daisy is a very confused monkey.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.720]   - Pondering its own mortality.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.220]   - Right, and so anyway, the first step is all about
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.200]   basically deciding who's in charge for that moment.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.080]   So blockchain is just a sequence of events
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.120]   the heart has to beat, the metronome has to click.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.880]   So somebody has to be in charge.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.000]   And so generally you have this notion of a resource.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.240]   So there's some pool of resource out there.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.400]   And it can be a token,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.240]   and in that case it's a plutocratic system,
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.760]   and that's what proof of stake does.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.440]   Or it can be computation,
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.720]   but there can be other resources.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.320]   But computation's what proof of work does.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.060]   And so you make so many hashes,
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.040]   and then eventually somebody wins.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.360]   And that person who wins is now the person
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.040]   who basically gets to decide the order of transactions,
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.240]   and put them all together
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.480]   from their perspective in the system.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.920]   Then once that person wins, they'll make the block,
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.640]   that's step two, and after it's made,
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.120]   transmit it, and it gets validated and accepted.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.160]   So actually it's quite fortuitous
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.520]   you have the magnifying glass,
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.720]   'cause at this stage people are trying to decide
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.120]   is what I'm looking at correct or not.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.400]   Now there are other ways to potentially conceive of this,
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.840]   but this particular model gives you
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.320]   a kind of a way of thinking of
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.640]   all consensus algorithms in one setting.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.120]   You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol,
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.080]   you can be Paxos, you can be Raft,
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.320]   you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.360]   It's always the same idea.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.960]   You have to find someone or some group to be in charge.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.520]   They'll reach a consensus on order.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.280]   They have to then do some work,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.480]   change the state of the system, update it,
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.400]   and then the network has to accept that that's valid.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.560]   So even if this process works well,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.440]   this side will say, oh, you created a Bitcoin
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.020]   at a thin error, you're not allowed to do that,
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.600]   so that's rejected.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.720]   There's a meta question of fairness in all of this.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.080]   So the proof of work people, they're kind of a cult,
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.000]   and they say that this is the only truth,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.620]   and everything out here, any other resource
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.440]   is not legitimate or valid.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.440]   And there's not a lot of evidence to that,
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.720]   but that's what they believe.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.920]   The proof of stake people, the downside and weakness
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.100]   they have is it's a plutocratic model.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.020]   The more ownership of the system you have,
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.240]   the more control you have over that system.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.280]   And it suffers from the same thing
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.760]   the shareholder models suffer from,
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.640]   whereas you may maximize short-term gain
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.880]   over the long-term viability of the system.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.320]   So a really cool question is,
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.020]   can you build systems that are multi-resource?
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.680]   So instead of just pulling from one resource
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.040]   to select who wins, this 25% of the time,
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.200]   and maybe this 25%, you can do that.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.240]   In fact, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.040]   There was a cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011,
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.400]   and it was a hybrid proof of work, proof of stake.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.780]   So some of the blocks were made
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.720]   with the token ownership distribution,
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.660]   and some of the blocks were made with proof of work.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.320]   But you could keep adding.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.280]   You could put in like, hey, I want hard disk in my thing.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.360]   You can put Permacoin in or something like that
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.000]   to create an incentive for hard drives.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:45.840]   And then you could say, oh no,
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.760]   I want to do like a human system, like a proof of merit.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.120]   Oh my God, now we're up to four.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.320]   And you just keep adding.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.100]   And each of these pools will have different adherence
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.520]   and actors, and then you can actually balance out
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.360]   the whole thing.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.920]   - So as opposed to having one cult, you have many cults.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.080]   - Exactly. - And they argue.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.400]   - And the cults argue with each other,
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.440]   and we call that a government.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.160]   - By the way, not all cults are bad.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.720]   Physics is a cult too.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.240]   - And it's sometimes bad.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.880]   - It's honest, at least.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.040]   Nature is a cult.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.480]   Nature is metal.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.600]   Check out the Instagram.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   So that's really the crux of it.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.460]   You have a ledger, and the ledger is just all about saying,
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.960]   hey, we need to put some stuff in here.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.520]   And once it's put in here, you can't turn it back.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.880]   And you know when it was put in,
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.240]   and everybody can see it, or some group can see it.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.640]   And then you need to pick somebody to modify that.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.120]   So all this chaos will happen,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.160]   all these transactions are all around the world,
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.280]   and our perception of them are different.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.880]   There's a beautiful paper from Lamport
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.760]   that kind of talks about this from the '70s.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.320]   It's like one of the most classic papers ever
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.480]   in computer science, I think.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.760]   It's been cited like 50,000 times or something like that.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.840]   It's a crazy paper.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.400]   But basically, you have to figure out,
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.920]   okay, well, somebody has to be in charge.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.560]   Some group has to be in charge.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.640]   You can do it with a meritocratic,
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.000]   hashocratic computation thing.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.920]   You can say, well, if you have coins, 25% of supply,
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.800]   25% of the time, on average, you'll be selected
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.200]   to have the right to do this or give it to somebody else.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.880]   Or you can search for other resources,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.160]   and they can even be human resources,
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.080]   like some notion of merit or social benefit.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.400]   Maybe you get a token for that,
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.760]   and you can weight it with these other systems.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.000]   And that's where kind of where everything's going.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.080]   We're getting to a point where we've really optimized
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.120]   all the properties here.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.200]   We've proven all these nice things about it.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.720]   And there's a lot of competition
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.800]   to basically build the perfect proof-of-stake system,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.920]   whether you're Polkadot or Algorand
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.800]   or any of these other guys.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.240]   But now the next step is say,
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.840]   well, why don't we just have one?
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.080]   We should have multiple resources.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.480]   And the point is each of these
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.240]   has different trade-off profiles,
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.680]   and so they balance each other,
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.660]   and you end up building a much more resilient system,
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.260]   so it's not winner-take-all with one particular demand.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.960]   - Okay, so there's a million questions
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.440]   that spring up right there.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   But first, linger on this topic and say,
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.840]   what is proof-of-work, what is proof-of-stake?
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.480]   Just zooming in on each of those.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.500]   And what are the differences?
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.920]   - Okay, so they all have the same three properties
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.640]   of pick someone in charge, do something, and validate it.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.840]   The difference is that the picking mechanism
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.400]   for proof-of-work is you have to solve a puzzle.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.600]   So it's basically like buying lottery tickets,
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.480]   and you can buy a certain amount every second
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.080]   with your computing devices,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.640]   and some of them are ASIC-resistant,
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.040]   so you run them on like a laptop or a GPU,
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.420]   and some of them are you specialized hardware
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.320]   that you have to either manufacture
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.640]   or buy from someone who sells it to you.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.080]   And that's just how many tickets per second you can get,
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.920]   and eventually you hit those magic numbers.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.380]   And when you do, it means you have the right
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:38.280]   to make the block, and generally you bundle the block making
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.940]   with the proof-of-work system.
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.000]   Now you can do this looking for a single,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.600]   or you can do this to actually shard it
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.520]   and look for multiple block makers at the same time.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.160]   So there are sharded proof-of-work protocols,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.820]   like Prism is an example of that,
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.760]   and actually Ethereum got started this way
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.340]   with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom,
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.660]   the Avi Zahar's work and Yonatan Samlipinsky.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:02.360]   But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people,
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.520]   they make some collection of things,
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.900]   and there's some way to sort it all out,
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.880]   serialize it, and prevent double spends.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.720]   Great.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.660]   The proof-of-stake is the same,
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.180]   but it's a synthetic resource.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.020]   So instead of doing things, they say,
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.740]   "Well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.060]   "over a long period of time,
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.540]   "you'd probably win 25% of the time."
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.740]   Well, why don't we just introduce some randomness in
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.900]   from some source, and then 25% of the time on average
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.900]   over a long period of time, you'll win.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.780]   So it's a synthetic resource.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.540]   But you still have to do the other two things.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.860]   You still have to make the block,
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.860]   and you still have to validate the block.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.900]   The big difference is this step in the proof-of-work world
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.760]   is horrendously expensive.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.500]   You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.820]   And the problem with that is that you have less resources
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:44.980]   for the other two.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.380]   And the other problem with that is that
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.240]   if this is horrendously expensive,
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.460]   you have an economy of scale kick in.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.060]   So what ends up happening is the system
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.400]   becomes less decentralized over time
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.820]   because you have these vertically integrated operations.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.980]   I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.820]   on a volcano in El Salvador.
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.860]   Not everybody can go to Mongolia
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.100]   and set up a five gigawatt power plant
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.300]   and a huge data thing.
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.940]   Not everybody has access to the patented ASICs
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.100]   that people produce.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.300]   'Cause what if I don't sell it to you
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.580]   and I have the patent on it?
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.240]   Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.660]   So you'll end up having centralization
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.660]   around maybe 10 or five major operations,
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.280]   as we've seen historically with proof-of-work.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.100]   And that means you end up having a ruling class
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.380]   of a mining oligarchy in the system.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.300]   Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly,
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.980]   you actually get more decentralized over time.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.220]   'Cause as the currency goes up in value,
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.880]   the distribution of the currency
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.140]   tends to get more egalitarian.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.620]   For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft,
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.500]   he had 64% of the shares.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.880]   Now he has less than 5% of the shares.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.060]   So there's founder drift over time.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.140]   As the value goes up, divestment occurs.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.620]   You have more and more and more people coming in.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.500]   That means there's more people
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.320]   who can participate in the consensus.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.180]   You can even tune economic parameters.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.940]   And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros.
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.700]   We created this concept of K in the system,
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.940]   and it's just a parameter.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.140]   It's like a forcing factor that tends to accumulate
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.220]   a certain amount of stake pool.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.140]   So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1,000 and so forth.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.260]   But the basic idea is as the price of ADA goes up,
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:23.100]   you make K larger, and then you end up, in practical terms,
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.080]   having a larger and larger set of actors making blocks
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.620]   that are unique and distinct.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.420]   And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.960]   instead of a physical resource,
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.820]   which means it's portable by the click of a button.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.880]   So let's say China says mining is bad,
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.980]   we're gonna shut it all down,
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.940]   and it looks like they're moving in that direction.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.180]   You have all these people in WeChat
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.060]   just trying to sell miners,
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.660]   or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners,
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.900]   'cause they have these huge data centers they've constructed.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.740]   You can't exactly go and grab a server
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:51.580]   and take it with you.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.420]   It's huge.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.260]   It's a lot of work.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.340]   And if the government seizes it,
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.020]   well, it's their property now.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.900]   A virtual resource, you can click a button
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.740]   and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.480]   So to me, for a virtual asset,
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.080]   it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.960]   to something endogenous, something within the system,
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.000]   because it's just like the asset.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.160]   It can move anywhere at a click of a button.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.120]   And human beings have a much harder time
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.480]   attacking something like that.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.800]   - Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.640]   devil's advocate and say,
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.560]   "What is the strength of proof-of-work system?"
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.380]   Because some people would argue that proof-of-work has,
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.040]   because it's outside the system,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.800]   it's tied to physical resources,
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   it's more secure, it's less prone to attack
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.520]   by large groups of people.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.840]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.880]   And the first question we had was,
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.760]   could proof-of-stake actually work or not?
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.720]   So the problem was that the engineers kind of led
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.080]   when the science should have led.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.160]   And so there were all these POS protocols
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.440]   that came out in the early 2010s,
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.160]   like Peercoin was the first,
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.280]   and then NXT and others came out.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.520]   And there they had suffered from things
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.560]   like the random number generation wasn't good.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.800]   They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:00.760]   and all these other things.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.600]   And there's a lot of beautiful properties
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.420]   for proof-of-work from a theoretical sense.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.780]   We even wrote a paper called GKL,
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.680]   named after the authors, Juan Gray,
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:13.080]   Nico Leonardis and Agulhos Gassis, our chief scientist.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.800]   It's got 1,100 citations now,
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.320]   and it was published in 2015.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.440]   But basically all it did is just modeled a blockchain
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.200]   and created some security properties for it.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.480]   And then it started talking about,
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.600]   well, what does proof-of-work actually do for you?
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.240]   And it turns out it does a lot.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.040]   It's an asynchronous system.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.640]   You can bootstrap from Genesis.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.040]   So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.880]   and Daisy joined the network,
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.500]   then you give them some different chains,
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.280]   like five or 10 different chains.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.960]   They can run a calculation
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.140]   and they will always pick the longest chain,
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.220]   the heaviest chain inside the system.
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.480]   That's a great property of proof-of-work.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.900]   Until we published Ouroboros Genesis in 2018,
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.880]   you actually needed to solve that in proof-of-stake
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.600]   with a trusted checkpoint.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.840]   So some actor had to be observing,
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.960]   watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.600]   And then when new people joined in,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.080]   they would only be able to distinguish between a chain
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.800]   based upon a checkpoint telling them that.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.200]   So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.920]   to show and create this notion of density
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.800]   to be able to show that that's possible.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.640]   But there's a lot of properties of proof-of-work
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.040]   that were super hard to replicate and emulate
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.960]   in the proof-of-stake world.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.600]   Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.120]   There was a group out of Cornell
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.100]   that talked about better network conditions.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.360]   They wrote a paper called Sleepy.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.960]   We did Genesis.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.760]   We also did the very first proof-of-secure protocol.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.280]   But that was six years of work and like 12 papers.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.160]   And it's still not done.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.840]   There's still a few polishing things
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.720]   that have to be cleaned up
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.920]   because this is a physical resource
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.400]   and there's something there.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.160]   But there's a flaw to proof-of-work
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.500]   that is a little problematic.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.180]   It's a winner-take-all type of a system.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:54.720]   So maximalism is kind of philosophically
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.620]   and computationally built into it.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.940]   Let's say you have two proof-of-work systems
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.200]   and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.320]   and they use the same algorithm.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.960]   Then the problem is if the miner comes in
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.800]   and let's say the miner has enough resources
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.540]   to have 51% for any of these chains,
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.080]   they actually have a perverse incentive
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.600]   to come and destroy one chain and short sell the asset.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.220]   It's called a goldfinger attack.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.300]   And then go mine the other asset
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.360]   'cause they're not bound to that asset.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.780]   They're not loyal to it.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.660]   And they can make just as much profit mining this
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.860]   as they can make mining the other system.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.480]   And the markets allow them to profit
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.180]   from the destruction of a system.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.780]   So that's something that proof-of-stake doesn't suffer from
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.700]   because the only way you can participate
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.740]   in a proof-of-stake system
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.180]   is you have to actually own equity
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.180]   and you have to have ownership in that system.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.420]   So if you go and destroy Daisy's chain,
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.520]   it would just be a net loss for the most part,
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.880]   unless you have really messed up markets
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.140]   or something like that.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.060]   So there's always trade-offs in all these things.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.180]   And this is why I like this concept of going one to end
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.940]   and having multiple resources
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.620]   because why not have proof-of-work
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.180]   and proof-of-stake together?
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.420]   If the proof-of-work is useful, not wasted computation,
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.600]   and why not add other things
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.780]   like create incentives for network relay?
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.440]   Right now there's no incentives in the system
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.380]   for you to run peer-to-peer nodes and to share data.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.560]   Right now it's not a problem,
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.180]   but if you're running like Amazon Web Services
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.060]   level of bandwidth,
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.740]   it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.380]   just to run a full node or something like that.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.500]   No one would do it.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.120]   So then your system will centralize along the weakest link,
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.540]   whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer,
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.160]   or the network layer of the system.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.500]   So if you can incentivize the resources differently,
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.020]   then you'll be in a beautiful position
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.700]   where you end up having a resilient system
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.500]   that pays its own bills.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:43.420]   - So how does Cardano solve the consensus problem?
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.820]   Do you tend to eventually wanting to solve it
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.380]   in the hybrid approach of proof of stake and proof of work?
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.260]   - Yeah, this was a philosophical difference
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.020]   between Vitalik and myself.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.460]   You know, the problem with the people in the Ethereum side
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.500]   is they're really bright.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.940]   And these really bright people,
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.940]   what they do is they try to do everything all at once
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.260]   'cause they're really, really smart
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.460]   and they keep going until they run up against the wall
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.940]   and they realize the problem's a lot harder.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.340]   If you're more experienced,
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.460]   and that's why we brought in proper academics
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.460]   like Agalos and others,
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.300]   'cause they've been beaten up through life.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.580]   You know, Agalos worked with David Chom
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.700]   and these other, this really hard work with those guys.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.260]   And they'd already been humiliated and yelled at,
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.060]   had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.100]   And so they were humble enough to say,
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.180]   "I'm not smart enough to solve the big problem,
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.300]   "so don't even try."
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.060]   What you do is you decompose it and you say,
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.300]   "Okay, what's the first problem to solve
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.660]   "in a chain of problems
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.260]   "that you can compose your way up to a working system?"
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.280]   And once you get far enough along,
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.540]   you have something that's pretty good,
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.740]   and then you have an obvious path forward
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.940]   of how do you iterate and improve that system.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.740]   That's why we started with GKL 15,
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.580]   because it was just saying,
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.220]   "We don't know what a fucking blockchain is.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.340]   "What is this thing, right?
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.900]   "What's the security properties of this stuff?
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.700]   "Like, what do we really mean?"
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.300]   Then we did Ouroboros Classic,
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.820]   the original Ouroboros protocol in 2017.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.100]   And that protocol was like a synchronous system,
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.300]   and it assumed the nodes were always on.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.020]   It worked, but it was useless,
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.040]   because that's not real life.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.580]   Then Paros came out, and then suddenly we relaxed things.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.420]   - These are all, by the way,
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.580]   names for consensus algorithms.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.540]   - Yeah, papers that we published,
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.740]   and they were all peer-reviewed.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.220]   Like, GKL was Eurocrypt.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.060]   That's a very hard conference to get into.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.620]   And Ouroboros Classic was Crypto,
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.560]   and Paros was Eurocrypt, and Genesys was CCS.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.180]   So basically, every step of the way
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.940]   was first an academic validation
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.260]   that there was some merit to the work that was done.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.060]   Second, it solved a particular class of problems,
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.820]   either showing the feasibility of the entire problem.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.580]   'Cause when I said, "Let's do the model first,
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.300]   "'cause let's see if we can do an FLP thing.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.200]   "Let's see if we can get a possibility theorem."
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.700]   That's great, 'cause you're done.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.580]   It's like those short math papers
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.260]   where you're like, "I found a counterexample."
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.280]   It's like, "Oh, okay, this whole thing has fallen apart,
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.820]   "'cause you have a two-line proof, thank you."
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.980]   So that's what we were looking for
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.660]   in the beginning of the agenda was,
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.780]   let's either prove it's possible in a straw man case,
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.140]   or show that there exists an impossibility result,
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.260]   in which case we can just abandon the entire inquiry.
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.980]   Proof of stake's impossible.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.120]   And then, once you've gotten past that threshold,
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.480]   it goes from theory to practicality.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.900]   What actual network conditions are you looking at?
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.380]   Are you okay with living with an external clock,
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.300]   or do you wanna build time from within?
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.980]   How are you generating random numbers, et cetera, et cetera?
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.940]   And every step of the way, each paper,
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.420]   you're solving one particular class of problems.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.700]   With PRISM, it said,
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.660]   "Probably shouldn't know ahead of time who Eve is.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.740]   "You probably shouldn't know who's making those blocks.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.840]   "That should be something after the fact.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.700]   "But if you know ahead of time, you can attack them.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.640]   "You can DDoS them.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.540]   "You cause all kinds of problems."
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.820]   Okay, so adaptive security.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.620]   Also, we move from an MPC, random number generation,
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.200]   which was great, but very heavy and very slow,
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.480]   and you can't scale to large amounts of people,
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.660]   to a VRF-based system, which is super fast,
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.760]   but a little dirtier,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.140]   'cause Algorand actually did some great work there.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.460]   There was some good knowledge there.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.820]   - What are the really hard problems that you,
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.760]   maybe if you just linger on a little bit,
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.540]   what are some of the really hard problems
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.660]   you have to solve along this chain of papers,
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.100]   ideas, the evolution of the consensus algorithm?
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.980]   - Yeah, not only are they really hard problems,
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.740]   they actually require different cryptographers,
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.800]   because you're moving from mathematician-style
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.780]   cryptographers, like the Neil Koblitz's
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:12.620]   and the Adi Shamir's,
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.900]   and the people that start as proper mathematicians,
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.660]   and they really love theory, and that's their thing,
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.580]   and the proofs are dense, and they're thick,
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:23.660]   and they're beautiful, to practical applied work,
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.720]   where you're saying, "Okay, now this is something
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.320]   "an engineer can look at and say,
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.540]   "I know how to build that.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.100]   "I know how to think about that."
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:35.100]   So that transition from GKL to Ouroboros Classic to Proust,
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.860]   I'd say the biggest leap was Classic to Proust,
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.920]   because that was going from a system
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.620]   that would only work in a consortium chain, like Fabric,
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.800]   to a system that would actually work, and is working.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.920]   That's what's implementing Cardano today,
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.660]   $50 billion cryptocurrency and all these people.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.180]   That was a huge leap, but that paper alone wasn't enough.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.920]   We also had to layer on the economic model,
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.860]   because we said, "Well, hang on a second here.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.020]   "Not everybody's gonna be online all the time
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.360]   "to be available to make a block,
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.400]   "so you need some notion of delegation."
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.880]   The minute you have a notion of delegation,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.300]   you have these stake pools, what the hell does that mean?
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.880]   And so this is a beautiful interdisciplinary notion
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.020]   that layers computer science and biology together.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.040]   And the minute that complexity starts going up,
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.400]   you start seeing cell specialization.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.220]   So you go from single-cell organisms to organisms
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:26.020]   where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts,
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.100]   and each of these tissues do different things.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.780]   Well, analogously, complex distributed systems
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.060]   start getting specialization.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.780]   You move from the single-celled thing, Bitcoin,
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.780]   where everything's a full node,
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.500]   they all have the same rights and responsibilities,
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.460]   a lot of homogeneity in that system,
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:40.980]   but you're only as good as your weakest link,
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.060]   you're only as capable as whatever the basic cell can do,
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.060]   to a specialized system where you start having
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.220]   these actors in the system that are actually
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.980]   a little different than the other actors.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.220]   So you introduce this concept of the stake pool,
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.740]   and suddenly now you have this actor
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.640]   where you're probably gonna be online 24/7.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.120]   You're probably gonna have extra relay infrastructure.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.660]   There's a trust relationship where you don't own the ADA,
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.840]   but you have a right to use it for something,
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.520]   and a person's made that choice to endow you with that.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.960]   The minute that you introduce specialization, though,
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.540]   the system gets more complicated,
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.420]   the game theory gets more complicated,
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.300]   and then you start having to think really deeply
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.780]   and carefully about, okay, well,
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.920]   can this now introduce a new attack vector
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.500]   that we didn't have before?
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.960]   So that leap from classic to Prowse
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.700]   and adding in stake pools and figuring out
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.040]   how to handle the game theory there
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.100]   was exceedingly hard.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.500]   It took two years to do that.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.420]   - So stake pools allow for multiple parties
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.740]   to delegate their staking capabilities to others.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.340]   Can you describe a little bit how this works?
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.180]   It's kind of fascinating.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.540]   - It's a super simple concept.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.780]   So you register a pool, and then the pool is there,
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.220]   and basically they advertise,
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.900]   and they're actually registered on-chain with a certificate,
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.660]   and then in the wallet software itself,
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.340]   you can see all of the pools that have registered.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.060]   There's over 3,000 of them now inside the system,
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.660]   and you can click a little tile,
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.020]   and it shows you all the metadata that's in the certificate
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.220]   and says, hey, I have my own pool.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.220]   It's called RATS, you know, king of the RATS.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.380]   So you can see all the stuff that's described there,
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.860]   and pools have an operating fee
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.900]   'cause they're like a business,
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.840]   and they say, well, if you delegate to me,
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.140]   I'll charge this much,
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.700]   so if you get like 100 bucks in rewards,
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:19.460]   I'll give you 90 and I'll take 10 or something like that,
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.460]   and then you make your decision,
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.580]   and whichever one you select,
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:24.320]   you click Delegate, you push the button,
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.700]   and then you have now given your staking rights
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.100]   to them until revoked, okay?
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:30.940]   So it lives there.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:33.700]   And then the stake pool's weight in the system
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.540]   is proportional to the amount of stake
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.300]   that they have delegated to them.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.420]   And then we have this other limiting factor, K,
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.500]   which says that you get diminishing returns
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.700]   with the more stake you have,
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.340]   so it's kind of like an S function.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.880]   So you kind of go up and up, and then eventually caps,
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.720]   and then at some point,
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.980]   you get no rewards beyond a certain threshold.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.780]   So there's an incentive to split pools
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.820]   to different owners after some point.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:54.660]   - Interesting.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.060]   - Yeah, and so that's a complex thing,
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.140]   and you have to actually model the game theory out
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.460]   to understand where those parameters should be set,
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.820]   and we didn't know how to do that.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.860]   So what we did is we bought talent.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:06.580]   We went to Oxford, and we hired this guy
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.900]   named Elias Kasupis, who's an algorithmic game theorist.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.420]   We said, "Hey, would you like to do
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.180]   "some game theory work in crypto?"
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.760]   And he's like, "That sounds fun."
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.220]   So he spent a year and a half,
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.680]   we built all these beautiful models,
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.300]   and we kind of figured out what those curves
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.140]   needed to look like.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:19.980]   - So figure out like the S curve
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.620]   that would result in a nice distribution
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.900]   of responsibility. - Exactly.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:26.220]   - So not everybody delegates to the king of the rats.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.060]   - Exactly.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.500]   - How does it feel to be royalty, by the way?
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.540]   (Lex laughing)
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.880]   - It's not a very impressive kingdom,
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.280]   but you're nevertheless a king.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.260]   - I'll take it, 'cause I think it's the kindest thing
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.780]   people call me in this space.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.220]   - Yeah, people love you.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.860]   So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that,
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.900]   would you say, a solved problem,
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.500]   the game theory of stake pools?
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.020]   - No, it's the starting, and then I was getting back
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.500]   to my original point that you build things in iterations.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.060]   Every step, if you've done it right,
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.860]   is an invitation for 10 more sexy, fascinating,
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.180]   fun problems, and this is why we have
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.780]   such a great time building labs.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.380]   We started in Edinburgh, now we're at Tokyo Tech,
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.300]   and University of Wyoming, and Athens,
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   and we're setting up more labs this year,
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.780]   and all these academics wanna work with us,
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.100]   A, 'cause we write a lot of really fascinating papers,
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.260]   but B, because we're focused on all these really cool,
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.100]   sexy, interdisciplinary problems.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.060]   We're actually running the problems
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.060]   where we don't even know where to publish the paper,
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.420]   'cause you'll have this paper where there's like
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.380]   these PL guys working with crypto guys,
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.100]   working with systems guys, working with economists,
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:23.940]   and you put it all together
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.140]   and you have this Frankenstein paper monster,
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.980]   and we're like, where do we submit this?
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.980]   Where does this go?
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.820]   - Nature.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:30.740]   - Yeah, there we go.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.860]   Nature or quanta or something, I don't know.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.700]   It'll run a nice--
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.500]   - So the sexy problems multiply exponentially.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.980]   - Exactly, and we've now gotten to a point
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.040]   where we're starting to work on refinements to the system
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.940]   rather than fundamental things that are like,
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.460]   if you don't solve it, the system just simply doesn't work.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.900]   For example, you can run all of this with NTP
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.620]   as your clock server, but you actually can create
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.700]   a notion of time within.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.500]   We wrote a paper called "World Wars Chronos" for that.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.300]   But that's not necessary for the system.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.520]   It's just a nice-to-have thing.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.420]   It's a nice property.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.100]   Optimization of the random number generation
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.040]   is another example of that.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.700]   You can run it with a heavier thing.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.100]   You just have more blockchain bloat
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.440]   and slower time and transition.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.920]   We have this concept in an epic.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.820]   So you elect leaders to run the system
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.760]   every five days with Cardano.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.140]   But there's been derivative work.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.120]   We didn't even do this.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.940]   This work occurred at University of Illinois,
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.140]   and that derivative work said,
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.340]   well, you don't actually need to do that.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.540]   You can do it on a block-by-block basis.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.140]   It's like, ooh, that's pretty cool.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.580]   So that's the other point about doing things
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:31.020]   in a very rigorous way is that that way
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.900]   creates a lingua franca for what you're trying to solve
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.420]   with the totality of the academic community.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.360]   So suddenly, people that you've never met,
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.480]   you know nothing about, have read your papers,
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.020]   cited your papers, and start writing their own papers,
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.700]   either to try to attack and destroy things you've done
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.060]   or to build on top of the things that you've done.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.380]   - So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.580]   - Exactly. - As rigorous as you are
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.140]   trying to build up the-- - And I don't have to pay 'em.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.260]   - That's the beautiful thing.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.100]   - It's fun. - Yeah.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.460]   - It's fun to try to destroy, and that's how we grow stronger.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.860]   - And it's how you build your career, too.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.300]   There's plenty of people that they've gotten tenure
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.820]   just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.980]   You go to CCS every year, there's some guy there,
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.480]   and he's having a hell of a time making Intel cry.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.300]   - Can we pull back, historically speaking,
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.540]   and in terms of the big picture of cryptocurrency
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.100]   real quick, and ask the question, what is Cardano?
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.540]   We started talking about already the consensus algorithm
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:26.540]   Cardano takes, but maybe when you look at the history books,
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.820]   sort of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.220]   and Cardano have one sentence.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.340]   What's that one sentence going to be?
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.220]   And in general, what's the vision in the context
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.540]   of the history of cryptocurrency?
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.580]   You have this whiteboard overview video
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.260]   that you talk about the three generations
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.420]   of cryptocurrency where Cardano's the third.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.700]   So that's five different questions,
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.060]   way of asking the exact same thing.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.620]   You can answer however the hell you want.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.700]   (laughing)
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.420]   - You know, I always term Cardano as like a FOSS,
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.980]   a financial operating system, and nobody likes it,
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.100]   and everybody picks on me for using that term.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.180]   But basically the idea is that the world runs on systems,
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.420]   especially the financial world.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.060]   You have the BIS and SWIFT and all this other stuff.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.700]   And these protocols allow you to move value around
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.460]   and represent things like identity
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.060]   and allow you to express yourself in some way.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.100]   And those protocols, for the most part,
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.100]   work well for people in rich countries.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.900]   And they don't work so well for people
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.580]   who aren't in rich countries.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:28.380]   And so the point of what we do,
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.620]   or at least what I do and what my company does,
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.220]   is we think a lot about how do we build a universal protocol
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.580]   that does all the stuff the legacy system has,
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.460]   but just does it better, faster, and cheaper
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.900]   for everybody in the world.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.140]   And everybody has equal access to it.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.820]   So it's the people's protocol.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.280]   You have a situation where the guy in Senegal
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.860]   has the same access that I do, or Bill Gates does,
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.500]   or someone else who's kind of higher
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.900]   on the spectrum of wealth and power.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.780]   And so that is what we seek to achieve.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.740]   But then the question is, well, is Cardano the solution?
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.460]   Is that that thing?
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.700]   And the answer is no,
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.520]   because you need a lot more evolution.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.980]   You need decades of evolution
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.860]   to kind of work your way there.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.180]   And in many ways, the work is never quite done,
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.940]   but it's better than what came before.
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:14.780]   Why?
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.180]   Because you have a realization that first,
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.100]   the control of the system needs to be
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.860]   more balanced and nuanced.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.640]   And it needs to be more democratic.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.660]   So there's this sustainability component
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.380]   of who's in charge and how do you pay for things?
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.020]   Well, the system can print its own money,
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.900]   so it always has the ability to have a budget.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.180]   Okay, so there's a treasury idea.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.780]   And then there's a voting thing.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.020]   Well, the same things that allow you to move money around
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.340]   allow you to represent votes.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.220]   So you can do e-voting with the type of system, okay?
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.860]   And if you played Nomic in the 1980s,
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.620]   or Peter Superfan, or any of these things,
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.300]   you can build a self-evolving system.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.080]   You can actually create a game where the rules
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.940]   can be voted on and changed in the game itself.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:53.820]   Great.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.260]   Okay, so that exists there.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.460]   And then you say, okay, well,
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.780]   but this thing still has to touch the legacy world.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:01.740]   There has to be cash in and cash out
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:02.880]   and these types of things.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.580]   So there's just this interoperability thing.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.140]   You need a Wi-Fi or a Bluetooth moment for the industry
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.860]   'cause nothing understands each other right now.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.740]   All these chains are blind, deaf, and dumb to each other.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.580]   And then there's this thing
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.380]   that it has to work at a huge scale,
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.720]   like billions of people.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.300]   And we've done that, but we've done that
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.800]   with large, multinational, trillion-dollar companies
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.220]   with centralized infrastructure.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:24.300]   We've never really done that with one master protocol
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.500]   that somehow does it for everyone.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.040]   The closest approximation is probably BitTorrent.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.500]   And there, it's a cool protocol,
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.060]   but it doesn't have all the oomph necessary
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.480]   to do something like this.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.820]   So Cardano is just our first approximation.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.620]   And like any good system, we wanted it to be self-evolving.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.920]   So once you get the philosophy out of where's the target
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.860]   of what do you want to do, then you build a community.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.700]   Now it's over a million people strong,
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.300]   and that community keeps growing,
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.820]   and they keep pushing the system
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.300]   in that particular direction.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.900]   And what's nice about it is if you build
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.700]   the right philosophy within the system,
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.880]   it doesn't need founders.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.500]   This is the great lesson of Satoshi.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.820]   It doesn't need founders to be able to get there.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   So if you look at the academic side,
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.700]   that's very decentralized.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.660]   We have more than 30 different contributors
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.260]   for the 105 papers, and that set keeps growing
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.260]   within the next five years.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.060]   It'll probably be two, three, 400 different scientists
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.620]   from all across the world, some from Russia,
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.420]   and some from India, some from China,
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.540]   and some from Japan, and America,
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.860]   and Africa, and South America.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.780]   And the faces change, the languages change,
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.480]   the cultures change, but the process stays the same.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.340]   And that is a permanent organ
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.900]   within what we have constructed as a system.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.940]   It's the same situation entering marketplaces.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.460]   Like we entered Ethiopia.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.300]   What are we doing there?
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.020]   We have five million people in Ethiopia.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.820]   We're getting them digital identity,
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.140]   and we're dragging that digital identity into the system,
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.420]   'cause that's the most fundamental thing
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.080]   of a financial operating system.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.660]   You need to know who people are
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.280]   in order to be able to do business with them,
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.140]   give them credit, be able to give them economic agency,
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:56.980]   and so the thing.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.180]   But once they're there,
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.260]   they're gonna grow up with that system.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.240]   They're gonna deploy applications on that system.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.420]   They're gonna build on that system.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.220]   Or use it every day for getting a loan,
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.700]   or payments, and so forth.
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:07.980]   And if they have pain points,
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.500]   what they're gonna do is evolve that system
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.100]   to be able to mitigate and manage
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.600]   those particular pain points
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.340]   to a point where the system is competitive for it.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.900]   So my job is to be,
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.340]   we have this tagline in our company,
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.900]   cascading disruption.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.740]   My job is to be the first domino.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.580]   Just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade,
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.420]   and it kind of blows, and blows, and blows,
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.260]   until eventually it gets to where we need to go.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.540]   And what I was trying to think about with Cardano
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.580]   was how do you build the minimum viable set
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.180]   of tools and social processes
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.060]   that once we push the domino,
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.860]   the system will just evolve to a point
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.200]   where eventually it can grow to fill that need,
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.340]   not out of charity, but out of self-interest.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.860]   People want things better, faster, cheaper.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.740]   People want to have economic agency,
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.280]   especially when they lack it.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.820]   Nobody wants to grow up in a world
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.220]   where they're unbanked,
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.100]   and they have no access to marketplaces.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.260]   They're gonna seek it.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.220]   Look at M-Pesa.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.820]   It's the great example of that.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:06.220]   Like cell phone minutes,
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.840]   they're using it as a currency.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.740]   So that's where we're at.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.900]   And I say a few more years,
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:13.060]   I think we'll have that right minimum viable
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.140]   set of dynamics inside the system.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.940]   And then it's inevitable, in my view,
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.580]   that it'll kind of grow and consume
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.220]   and become this concept.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.660]   And what's really cool is there's competition
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.780]   in the systems and concepts.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.800]   So China's trying to do the same thing.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.820]   They're saying, how do we de-dollarize the world
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.320]   and create a digital yuan?
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.220]   So they have a very top-down notion
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.260]   of how to apply this technology and bring it in.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.480]   And they even have an identity system
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.780]   they're building in parallel called social credit.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.500]   We have an identity system, a teleprism,
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.320]   that we're putting in.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.300]   Ours is bottom-up and you own your own identity,
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.140]   social credit.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.500]   You have no idea, you just have a number
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.980]   and some computer's giving it to you,
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.140]   but they're both trying to do the exact same thing.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.020]   And it's gonna be this clash of cultures at some point
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:53.140]   between the open FOSs and the top-down authoritarian FOSs
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:56.020]   and probably some Hegelian dialectic action.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.100]   We'll create some sort of somewhat close,
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:02.740]   somewhat authoritarian, libertarian utopia.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:05.580]   - Yeah, and most likely it would be AIs battling
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.660]   in the space of FOSs.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.000]   So I really like this idea of financial operating system,
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.520]   but the letter F, so financial,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.040]   is this just a basic mechanism
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.440]   with which you can have social interaction,
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.320]   therefore, or all kinds of interactions,
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.760]   therefore have an identity?
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.200]   Like is F essential to this?
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.240]   - Yeah, because that's how people care.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.320]   You need resources to survive.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.480]   And finances is kind of like this field
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.160]   of managing your resources in an intelligent way.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.520]   And you could call it SOFI too, social finance.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.420]   You know, the nomenclature hasn't exactly been settled
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.420]   for our industry, and that's fun.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.800]   But basically the concept is that you have something
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.280]   and you wanna be able to store it, transform it,
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.020]   trade it, and use it to survive.
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.740]   And the question is what rails do you do that on?
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.380]   Do you do those on centralized, controlled rails
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.280]   where there are these third parties
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.460]   that are basically able to live off those things,
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.040]   become very fat and nepotistic?
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.640]   Or do you wanna do it on rails where there's no middleman?
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.000]   You have a direct relationship
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.320]   with whoever you're doing business,
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.200]   and if you invite more people to the transaction,
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.600]   they're middlemen of value, not necessity.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.560]   And that's really the, I would like to say
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:20.560]   the resendetra of our space, that the reason we exist
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.920]   is to try to figure out a way to kill the middleman
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.040]   and try to figure out a way that we can
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.080]   better quantify value and transform it,
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.480]   move it, manipulate it.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.280]   And in many ways, we've actually discovered
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.780]   some amazing things in the last 10 years as an industry.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.440]   Like we've kind of created the financial stem cell.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.800]   This idea of a token can now just as well
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.880]   be a national currency as a CBDC
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.560]   as it can represent a CryptoKitty.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.100]   The same architecture can do stuff at the nation scale,
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.400]   can do stuff for a 12-year-old kid in Texas.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.040]   It's pretty amazing to see that.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.960]   - But sort of in that whiteboard presentation,
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.920]   you gave these three phases, and you're kind of implying
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.820]   that there'll be N phases to this whole evolution,
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.400]   and Cardano is just like the cutting edge.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.780]   But if you look back to Bitcoin,
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:12.340]   how would you compare Cardano versus Bitcoin?
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:16.180]   Sort of where we are, how we started, and how it's going.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.060]   - Okay, so what I did in that video,
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.340]   and I've done in a lot of media interviews,
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.540]   'cause I think it really helps people understand
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.860]   where we're at in the clock,
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.740]   is face things in terms of generations.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:30.040]   And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.800]   Really, the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.860]   is saying every time we want to represent or move value,
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:38.980]   we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.460]   So can we build some sort of system
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.340]   where we can create some notion of value
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.880]   that can be teleported around the world,
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.260]   and it doesn't require a trusted third party?
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.100]   That's it.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.720]   And it's done in a beautiful way
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.500]   because it didn't try to be anything else.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.500]   It just was, you only have Bitcoin,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.760]   you can only do one type of thing, you can only push it.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.740]   You can do some things on the encumbrances
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.660]   of like multi-sig and other things,
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.220]   but that's a one-trick pony as a system.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.300]   And it wasn't really clear
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.260]   if that was gonna work or not for a long time.
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.800]   It took several years to build up enough network effect
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.140]   and for Bitcoins to actually become valuable.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.160]   And I'd say the inflection point was 2013.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.740]   And at that point, it became a billion dollar market cap.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.980]   There were like Silicon Valley startups,
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.940]   real exchanges performing.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.660]   And it got to a point where there was legitimacy
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.500]   behind the concept, and people started getting,
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.540]   this is a really incredible idea
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.900]   'cause I can evade capital controls with it.
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.800]   I can move $10 billion of something
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.060]   from one country to another country in five minutes.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.820]   It's like I could never do that before.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.940]   And some said, this is incredible.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.920]   Okay, the problem is the minute
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.940]   that people validate the idea,
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.260]   they immediately want something they don't have.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.860]   So the minute Elon can land a rocket,
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:50.500]   there's the next big thing, right?
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.600]   You've landed the Falcon 9, now you're on the Starship.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.380]   Similarly, you say, okay, I want programmability
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.220]   with this thing.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.820]   It's kind of like when JavaScript came to the web browser.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.220]   You went from these static, perhaps pretty,
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.460]   but ultimately static non-interactive pages
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:08.100]   to YouTube and Google and Facebook
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.860]   and these amazing, rich, incredible experiences
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.260]   because now you can actually interact with the user.
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.420]   You can program things.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.800]   Stuff runs on their side, stuff runs on your side.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.180]   It's a beautiful two-way relationship.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.300]   So that's what Ethereum effectively did.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:24.120]   They bolted a programming language onto a blockchain
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.640]   and they went from a certain use case
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.040]   to whatever your imagination can have,
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.520]   you know, like sunshine and rainbows and unicorns
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.480]   and these types of things.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.800]   - So what you're saying is Bitcoin is HTML
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.400]   and Ethereum is JavaScript?
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.360]   - Basically, yeah, it was like when JavaScript came
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.000]   and with like JavaScript,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.160]   it has all kinds of problems and issues.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.040]   - I wonder who's Flash in this analogy, this metaphor.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:46.880]   But let's not go there.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.080]   - Well, actually, there were plenty
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.440]   of active Xs and Flashes.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.100]   NXT was an example of a fail to start
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:54.100]   and BitShares was another example.
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.060]   There were a lot of people who tried to add some notion
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.540]   of programmability and/or a different view
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.160]   of how these things should be done
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.020]   and they were not as competitive.
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.300]   Ethereum kind of came out as that JavaScript moment.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.360]   Okay, the minute you have that,
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.620]   then suddenly you have ICOs and DeFi and STOs and NFTs
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.940]   and all these word salads of things.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.900]   And then people start using it and they get frustrated.
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:14.740]   Why?
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.580]   Because it's too slow, it's too expensive,
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.700]   it doesn't talk to the things they want it to talk to
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.820]   and also, it gets too big to manage itself.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.060]   When you're small, you have founders and foundations
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.340]   and you have trusted actors and core developers
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.200]   and you can feed them with pizzas.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.660]   You know them, you can meet them,
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.500]   you can shake their hands at conferences.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.540]   When you're a multi-billion person system,
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:39.860]   you're too large to be able to do that.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:42.860]   For example, we had the Shelly Summit last year,
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.860]   we invited Vince Cerf to come to the summit.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.540]   Vince's a brilliant guy and he created the internet
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.940]   with Bob and the rest of the gang.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.460]   Back in those days, it was such a simple, small system
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.940]   that one of their students, they said,
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:56.780]   "Hey, you need to test it."
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.380]   He created a video game just to kind of test the thing.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.060]   You could call the guy on the other side and say,
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:00.900]   "Are you seeing this?
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.860]   "Are you getting the signal?"
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.540]   They used to have an actual address book
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.020]   for email addresses.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.260]   Yeah, so you'd open up the book--
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.660]   - Amazing. - Look it up.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:08.940]   And now look at the internet, it's like,
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.020]   who's in charge of that?
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.900]   It's this gargantuan network
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.340]   and there's no group of people you can bring in
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.540]   and thus the internet evolves very slowly.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.020]   You see, and so that's the problem
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.360]   is that you have this situation
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.340]   where you wanna do lots of utility.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.180]   You wanna do a lot of things.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.100]   You wanna be a financial operating system
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:28.800]   and be everything to everyone,
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.660]   but then your rate of evolution slows down
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:32.580]   as your rate of adoption speeds up.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:35.040]   So that's one of the other design goals
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:35.880]   of the third generation.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.680]   It's not good enough just to do things better, faster,
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.840]   cheaper and have consistent cost
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.500]   with your population growing
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.900]   or talk to everything, your Wi-Fi moment.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.460]   You also need a system that can govern itself
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.260]   at a scale of millions to billions of people
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.740]   who have divergent interests.
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:52.400]   Some cases, ice pick an eye, divergent interests.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.420]   They really hate each other and they don't get along.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.820]   And so that's what we termed
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.340]   a third generation cryptocurrency
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:00.300]   and there's a lot of people attempting
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.940]   to compete in that space.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:05.060]   There's Tezos and Algorand and ICP and Polkadot
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:07.100]   and so forth and each and every one of them
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.660]   kind of brings a different blend of things that they value.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.540]   So it's not completely equal between scalability,
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.620]   interoperability and sustainability.
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.300]   Some people were very focused on high throughput,
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.180]   lots of transactions perspective.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.740]   Other people very focused on governance
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.860]   like Tezos is like the governance chain
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.260]   and they were one of the first to do a self-amending ledger
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.140]   and other people are like Aeon or Polkadot.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.340]   They're really thinking carefully
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:34.060]   about how do we build a nice interoperable ecosystem.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.540]   With Cardano, we tried to actually tackle
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.800]   all three at the same time,
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.640]   which was one of the reasons
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.940]   why we were a little slower out of the gate.
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:41.340]   We had to write a lot more protocols
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.960]   but we think we've kind of come up
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.900]   with a beautiful interlocking design for all of them.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.140]   And again, the point is not to get it perfect
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:52.020]   but rather get those just right set of evolutionary factors
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.620]   that when you click the domino,
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.520]   it just self evolves into what you need it to get to.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.820]   - Allow me to stretch the metaphor further.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.940]   If Bitcoin is HTML, there's HTML5.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.420]   If Ethereum is JavaScript,
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.860]   JavaScript with V8 has become quite fast,
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.220]   quite, you know, it runs much of the internet.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:15.100]   So the argument could be that eventually
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.100]   everything will be JavaScript
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:20.620]   or maybe you could say eventually everything will be HTML
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.180]   and it's just be a bunch of different tools
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.800]   that generate that HTML.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:28.260]   So is it possible that just like we were so,
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.980]   we eventually return to generation one, Bitcoin,
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:35.160]   or we return to generation two, Ethereum,
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.340]   as we, you know, at the end of this journey?
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.260]   - Yeah, the problem is your tail is wagging the dog there.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.380]   And it's not, you have a situation
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.620]   where you're so focused on the technology
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:48.660]   that you're failing to understand
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.500]   that there's still Daisy here.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.100]   You still have the user and where's the app store?
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.780]   Where's the one-click install?
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:56.140]   Where's the use and utility?
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.020]   You know, all these layer two protocols
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.260]   and these DeFi applications,
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:01.260]   in five years they're completely protocol
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:03.180]   and blockchain agnostic.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.020]   Because at the end of the day,
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:05.980]   they care about liquidity, operating cost,
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.380]   and user experience.
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.340]   It's so preposterous and absurd for somebody to say,
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.980]   oh, well, I'm going to go build my application,
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.820]   get on the, you know, the Apple store,
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.460]   and I am going to use Amazon as my web host.
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:20.420]   And no matter what happens, I will always use Amazon,
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.220]   even if the operating cost is crazy.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.300]   - I see. - You see?
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.940]   And so we're just in a unique period of history
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:27.160]   where there's a network effect
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.100]   around some initial infrastructure.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.860]   And people tend to be building around that.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:35.500]   But every single one of the top DeFi providers are,
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:38.020]   if they're getting successful into a certain network effect,
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.380]   they're having the multi-chain conversation.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.540]   So I don't really believe in a winner-takes-all,
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.100]   maximalist view of, well, there's going to be some protocol
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.340]   that becomes the god protocol.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:48.420]   First, because they evolve too quickly.
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.900]   Second, the incentives aren't aligned for that.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.260]   TCP/IP didn't have a token connected to it.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.980]   There was no financial incentive
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.300]   where if TCP/IP got adopted over something else,
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.180]   they'd make some big company crazy amounts of money.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.660]   It was a useful piece of infrastructure.
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.060]   So I think that the third generation
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:07.620]   is going to be as defined by the social components
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.100]   and the usability components
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.380]   as it is by the technological capabilities of the system.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.660]   Really what these technological capabilities gave you
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.040]   was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.220]   and say these things are possible.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:20.740]   Kind of like Xerox PARC.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.860]   You know, when Steve and Bill came in, they said,
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.140]   "Wow, you have networked computers,
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.460]   "object-oriented programming, and a GUI."
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:30.340]   And this is like, what, was it '70s?
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:31.940]   It's like, wow, it's like incredible.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.480]   But none of that was an actual product.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.560]   That wasn't a Macintosh.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.180]   But it was enough to get the idea,
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.340]   and then it was a race to how do we productize
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:40.260]   something like that.
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:43.060]   And in that case, it actually took several decades
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.220]   to roll out that vision that those guys had.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.700]   And I think that's what Bitcoin and Ethereum did.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.400]   But what's unique about this is normally you throw away
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.740]   the prior experiments.
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:54.060]   With these things, these are self-evolving systems.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:57.500]   So it's entirely possible to, you know, Joe Rogan quote,
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.060]   to evolve Bitcoin to a point where it could become
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.940]   a third generation system if desired,
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.720]   as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.920]   And it's the same for Ethereum.
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.080]   In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.960]   and replacing it with Ethereum 2,
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.760]   'cause he recognizes he needs to upgrade
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.800]   and evolve the system.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.040]   And that's what makes it fun,
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.840]   because the techniques and methodologies
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.560]   that they've chosen to evolve and upgrade this system
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:24.280]   are distinctly different from the ones that we've chosen.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.780]   And we have no idea which one's actually going to win,
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.240]   but we learn from each other,
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.940]   and we co-evolve from each other.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:32.520]   So you're running all these experiments in real time,
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.720]   in a giant marketplace, and maybe they'll consolidate,
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.880]   maybe they'll stay divergent.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.100]   I mean, look at big tech.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:40.280]   You have Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.880]   They all coexist, and they're trillion dollar companies.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:46.120]   Some cases, with TCP, it consolidates to one standard,
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:47.680]   and that's what we end up using.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.120]   - So what's your intuition with Cardano
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.960]   having the proof of stake,
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.520]   and then eventually smart contracts,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.000]   versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies,
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   this kind of evolving creature?
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   Again, you said you can't really predict the future,
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.460]   but what's your intuition,
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:10.460]   why one might be more successful than the other?
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:14.960]   - So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   It's like the mainframe programming of the past.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.680]   And the only reason it's still around
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.240]   is because there was so much invested in keeping it around
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.160]   that we just kind of have to leave it there,
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.380]   and one day Cobol will die.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.520]   There's nothing about it from a collection of USPs
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.120]   that's particularly desirable.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.000]   You have extremely long settlement time.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.160]   You have extremely low programmability.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.680]   It is not aware of any other system.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.320]   There's no native way of issuing an asset in that system.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.160]   You can't even do a pull transaction.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.080]   You can't do anything that's interesting or unique there.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.480]   And yeah, all due respect, it's, you know, mafia.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.520]   All due respect, Tony.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.160]   (Lex laughing)
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.000]   You got some problems.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:54.840]   You need to lose some weight. - You come to me
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.600]   on the day of my daughter's wedding.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.440]   - I know, I know.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.400]   So, you know, all due respect to the Bitcoin people.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:03.200]   It's like an amazing, incredible first-generation thing,
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.480]   and it really, we're all here because of Bitcoin.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.560]   But the problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.560]   You know, just because you were a high school football star
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.880]   doesn't mean that 30 years later
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.280]   you're still a high school football star in the same shape.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.680]   You got the beer belly, you're old,
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:18.880]   you're not doing this thing again.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.460]   That's what Bitcoin has to do.
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.960]   There's fundamental improvements
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:25.560]   that I think Bitcoin can make at the protocol level
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.640]   that would actually make it
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.240]   an incredibly competitive system.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.520]   Like if they wanted to keep Nakamoto consensus,
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.280]   proof of work, there's ways to enhance proof of work.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:36.040]   I mean, Minkins-Seer did this with Bitcoin-NG.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.620]   Promotiv-Eswanis did this with Prism.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.320]   Make it 10,000 times faster,
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.000]   and you don't compromise the fundamental security assumptions
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.160]   that the system has.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.040]   You can add programmability to it.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.640]   Blockstream created a language called Simplicity.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.480]   So there's actual ways to extend,
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.340]   and we did this with Cardano with the extended UTXO model.
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:55.640]   There's ways to extend what Bitcoin has.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.440]   Keep the philosophy, the accounting,
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.640]   the way of thinking about transactions,
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:02.440]   but then suddenly you can now do DeFi and other things.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.520]   But what they've done is said,
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.200]   we will not evolve the base layer at all,
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.760]   and we're just gonna build all this layer two stuff,
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.640]   which is usually highly fragile and centralized,
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.080]   and requires enormous effort
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.840]   at the base level to do anything.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.800]   It's not a coincidence.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.840]   Vitalik started as a ColorCoins guy
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.240]   and a MasterCoin guy, hanging out in those circles.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.800]   He was trying to innovate and do things in Bitcoin,
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.880]   and it was so hard and difficult
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.200]   that he started diverging and going and doing things
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.080]   in a different system entirely.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.760]   I knew the MasterCoin guys, JR, all these people.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.680]   They were maximalists.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.440]   They really wanted to build something cool
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.800]   and exciting for Bitcoin,
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.240]   and anything they did, the developers would attack them.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.320]   It's all, you're misusing op return.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.160]   You're doing this, that.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.680]   It was a holy war any time you wanted to evolve.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.680]   So I think it's its own worst enemy.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.920]   It has the network effect.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.960]   It has the brand name.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.920]   It has the regulatory approval,
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.640]   but there's no way to change the system,
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.640]   even correcting obvious downsides in that system.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.360]   Now, what's really cool is Ethereum
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.280]   doesn't suffer from that problem.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.440]   It's getting to a point where it has
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.200]   a similar network effect to Bitcoin,
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.980]   but the community there is completely different in culture.
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.040]   They love evolving.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.520]   They love upgrading, sometimes a little too much.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.240]   And so that means that if you look
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.480]   at the trajectory of things,
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:17.280]   if I had to bet just those two systems,
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   Bitcoin or Ethereum, I would say nine times out of 10,
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.320]   Ethereum is going to win the fight against Bitcoin
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.160]   if it was the only competitor.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.560]   But obviously we're here and a lot of other people are here,
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.600]   so there's different things going on.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.480]   So it's a much more complex game.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.320]   But I think that's always a key,
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.120]   zooming out a little bit.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.600]   Set the technology aside
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.520]   and the word salad of cryptography aside
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.720]   'cause it's too much.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.040]   What you have to always do is say,
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.000]   what incentive does the system have to evolve?
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.600]   And when you look at things like Android and the App Store
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.880]   and these analogous platforms,
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.120]   you say, ah, the evolution is user-driven
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.340]   and there's a financial incentive
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.760]   for the user to participate.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.160]   So if I had to look at the trajectory of this thing,
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.640]   come back 10 years later,
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.860]   it's probably gonna have millions of applications
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:01.680]   and lots of stuff going on
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.200]   because that's the way the system was constructed.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.520]   Okay, it makes sense.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.640]   When you look at Bitcoin, you say,
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.240]   what is the incentive to evolve the system?
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.500]   There's none.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.320]   What is the incentive for the system
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.720]   to get more competitors?
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.760]   None, in fact, it's the opposite.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.500]   They've turned it into a religion.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.480]   I was in Miami at this Bitcoin conference there.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.520]   I had a toilet paper roll thrown at me
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.060]   that had shitcoin written on it.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.480]   You have Max Keiser out on the stage
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.280]   doing his best Rick James impression.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.560]   - Was he the guy that did the F Elon?
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.040]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.880]   - That's wonderful.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.480]   - You're watching this stuff and you say,
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.840]   okay, first, why would anybody wanna join that?
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:40.560]   And then second, where is the conversation
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.560]   about how do we achieve something?
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.480]   I started with Cardano, the end in mind.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.040]   I said, we really wanna sit down
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.000]   and build this financial operating system
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   and the definition of success is
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.340]   the poorest person in the world
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.900]   has access to the same system
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.500]   as the richest person in the world
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.700]   and they both get treated fairly.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.180]   We've never had that happen before.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.060]   Okay, that's something.
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.340]   You can agree with it, disagree with it,
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.220]   say it's boiling the ocean, it's impossible.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:04.460]   At least I have something.
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.340]   I can't for the life of me understand
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.100]   what the hell is the point of Bitcoin.
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:11.140]   When I joined the Bitcoin space way back in the day,
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.020]   it was, hey, we hate the dollar
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.880]   and hey, we like gold a lot.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.940]   Let's create digital gold.
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.740]   Let's build a payment system.
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:20.020]   And then it just kind of went all these different directions
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.680]   and nobody can actually tell you what Bitcoin is for.
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.520]   It's a store of value, okay.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.200]   There's some proof of work thing
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.680]   where maybe you're like incentivizing
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.920]   alternative energy to be produced.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.760]   I don't know.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.680]   It's like nobody really knows the philosophy.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.920]   There's no direction and they say, but don't worry.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.280]   Just buy and hold and everything will sort its way out.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.320]   - I believe it's HODL.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.560]   - Yeah, HODL.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.400]   - What about the idea of digital gold?
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.880]   So trying to replace that particular physical material
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.240]   that is gold and transfer into the digital space.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.680]   - It's something, okay, let's do that then.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.800]   And just say that's all it does.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.100]   Then why are we doing lightning?
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.280]   Why are we doing any of these other things?
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.760]   'Cause you don't really need with a commodity,
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.120]   a digital commodity, high throughput.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.320]   You can have slow settlement.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.760]   You can have high transaction fees,
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.600]   all these types of things.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.040]   And that's fine.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.280]   Okay, that's something, pick it.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.920]   - Well, the idea is to try to come up with technology
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:11.320]   like the lightning network
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.600]   that could have something like gold,
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.040]   but then still build an economy around it.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.040]   Something with a high throughput transactions.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:21.120]   - And have we ever built a successful banking credit system
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.360]   off of gold?
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.520]   Never, it never works because there's too much volatility
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.720]   in the underlying asset.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.000]   Would you take a gold denominated loan for something?
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.840]   If somebody says, all right, I'll give you five bars of gold
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.680]   to go buy this car and pay me back
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:35.040]   five and a half bars of gold.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.360]   Nobody would know in five years where they come out
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.200]   in that kind of arrangement.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.600]   - The idea is that the gold is used
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.240]   for the settlement of transactions.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.720]   And then you're operating,
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.960]   the actual economy is operating outside of gold.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:48.200]   And then you kind of connect back to gold.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.840]   - So you have to go back to the gold reserve.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.880]   And we tried that for a long time.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.760]   It didn't really work in a modern global economy.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.880]   We had the Brentwoods Agreement and all these other things.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.080]   And so I understand what you're saying.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.920]   Maybe there's some merit to that.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.160]   But if that was really in earnest where they want to go,
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.880]   then the conversation should be about,
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.400]   well, how do we make it easy for layer two protocols
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.120]   to interact with Bitcoin?
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.280]   So why is simplicity not built into it?
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.200]   Why is it taking so long to do snore sigs?
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.960]   Why is it taking so long to do all of these obvious upgrades
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.240]   which are cryptographically low danger?
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.280]   Also NIPA Pals, non-interactive proofs of proof of work.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.880]   There's no cost to doing that.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.680]   It's just a property of proof of work
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.920]   where certain puzzles are more special than other puzzles.
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.720]   And by noticing that, you can create these beautiful proofs
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.000]   that allow you to have side chains and like clients.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.120]   It's not compromising security of the system.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.520]   It's just something you get for free with proof of work.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.120]   Those came out in 2016.
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:40.280]   There's derivative work fly client floating around.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.760]   Where the hell is it?
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.760]   This is the frustration that I have is like,
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.880]   if you really are serious about this whole lightning
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.720]   and gold economy thing, I love choice.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.060]   I'm a libertarian by nature.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.320]   I love competition.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.040]   And I read all those books.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.120]   I read Ludwig von Mises' work and Murray Rothbard's work.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.640]   I love what Hayek had to say about private currencies.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.700]   Let's go try it.
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:00.540]   That's great.
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.440]   But then you have to have some focus
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.120]   and commitment as an ecosystem.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.080]   And the excuse they use is, well, no, we don't
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.320]   because we're decentralized.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.360]   And because we're decentralized, we don't need that.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.040]   As if there's some sort of guiding swarm intelligence
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.200]   that will naturally push the system
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.960]   in that particular direction.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.160]   But then you ask, well, how do people measure
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.640]   the success of Bitcoin?
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.700]   Is it the fact that they've actually achieved
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:27.720]   lots of transactions and lots of actual economic activity
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.160]   and lots of businesses accepting Bitcoin?
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.400]   - The number go up.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.000]   - It's the price.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.200]   That's what they do.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.800]   And that's the only thing they pay attention.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.320]   That's why this is the most attended
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.960]   Bitcoin conference in history.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.560]   Not because somehow Bitcoin got so much more adoption.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.880]   It's because this is the highest price point
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.760]   Bitcoin has ever been this year.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.000]   You know, over 30,000.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.800]   - So first of all, let me state that Charles,
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.400]   for the most part is purely objective.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:55.360]   The bias that comes in for the record, I want to say,
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:58.040]   that I have heard, 'cause you mentioned the mafia,
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.840]   that you prefer good fellows over the godfather.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.400]   So a man who prefers good fellows over godfather,
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.980]   you take it for that opinion for what it is.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.880]   - I actually had to think about that one for quite a bit.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.720]   I think--
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.120]   - Oh, come on, Joe Pesci was so good at that.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   - He's incredible.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:18.280]   I also love Casino and those big glasses on De Niro.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.480]   I love it with Sharon Stone.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.000]   But we could talk about that for hours.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   But let me ask you about the Bitcoin conference,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.560]   'cause it is kind of, I would say,
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.400]   an important moment in human history.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.520]   It was quite exciting in terms of size
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.200]   and kind of turmoil and all those kinds of things.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.200]   And you were there in, what is it, hot and humid Miami?
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.480]   I believe is the way you introduced it.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:44.920]   So what do you make of the community of Bitcoin
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:49.120]   or that particular event in human history?
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.680]   - What makes me sad is I remember the old Bitcoin community
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.200]   and I've seen what it's become.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.920]   And the old community was really fun,
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.120]   like the San Jose conference in 2013
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.320]   or subsequent conferences.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.000]   You know, there was just a lot of people,
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.200]   they had no money.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:06.000]   They just really loved this idea of decentralized money.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.160]   They loved this idea of decentralization in particular.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.720]   And you could strike up a conversation with everyone.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.400]   There was no ego at all.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.800]   But what was really fun is you could really get
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.800]   intimate friendships and relationship
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.760]   and great conversations with people there.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.120]   It's kind of like the early days of AI,
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.200]   you know, they all met in Dartmouth
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.800]   and all these other places, very intimate.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:26.640]   There was no egos.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.680]   Everybody was just trying to do some really cool stuff.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.720]   Now, just like those early days,
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.480]   there was an overestimate of how robust
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.440]   the solutions would be.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.680]   So we believed, oh yeah, in 10 years,
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:38.600]   we're gonna rule the whole world, right?
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.640]   Didn't exactly happen.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.440]   On the other hand, Bitcoin grew from nothing
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.560]   in just 11 years to, I'm in Mongolia riding camels
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.120]   and the camel herder has Bitcoin in the Kobe desert.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.560]   So that's telling you that's a pretty pervasive technology
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.760]   if you have that level of adoption that quickly.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.360]   When I went to Miami, it was unrecognizable.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.000]   You know, everything was so commercial.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000]   Half of the vendors at the conference were like watches
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.240]   that would cost half a million dollars
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.880]   and they were covered in diamonds.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.560]   So when you see that kind of materialism
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.080]   leak its way in, it's first is repulsive.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.320]   The other thing was there was no,
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.240]   like I remember one of the first conferences,
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:19.040]   Mo Levin's conference in January of 2014,
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.360]   the North American Bitcoin Conference,
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.920]   ironically in Miami, there was a Bitcoin help center booth.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.680]   Dima ran it and a few of the other Bitcoin OGs ran it.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.280]   The core developers actually came over,
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:32.000]   like Jeff and others, who were there and sat at the booth.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]   Anybody come up, ask a question,
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.560]   anything you wanna ask about Bitcoin.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.880]   It was like, that was the culture,
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.680]   just help people, welcome in.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.840]   There was no help booth there.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.040]   There was no notion of that.
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.680]   There were six hour lines and superstars
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.520]   and things like that.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.560]   And again, again, it was always the same thing.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.760]   Look how much money all these people have made.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.040]   And the whole point of Bitcoin
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.000]   was to redefine the notion of money,
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.040]   redefine the notion of value, you know,
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.240]   these types of things.
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.680]   So it just, I'm no longer part of that.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.120]   And it made me sad because I really enjoyed
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.560]   being part of the, how I got started
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:04.880]   was the Bitcoin Education Project.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.020]   I did a class on Udemy.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:07.080]   I gave it away for free.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.920]   I had 80,000 students and they would email me.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.960]   I got 5,000 emails before I stopped answering them.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.720]   And everyone come in and ask me some question
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   about something, sometimes arcane, sometimes trivial.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:20.240]   And I'd take the time to sit down
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.120]   and answer the question or forward the email
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.360]   to somebody I knew who could answer
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.920]   that particular type of question.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.100]   And there were some amazing people in the early days,
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.120]   like Mike Hearn and Gavin and others.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.520]   And they were just super committed.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.560]   And in Mike's case, he knew Satoshi.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.320]   He actually emailed him back and forth
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:37.620]   'cause he was around 2009, 2010.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.720]   He did the Bitcoin Java client.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:40.760]   And Satoshi was all excited.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.120]   He said, "Oh, wow, Bitcoin can come to a cell phone.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.540]   "This is really cool and exciting."
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:46.380]   And then what happened?
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.740]   Mike left Bitcoin in 2013
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.380]   over the whole big block debate that happened.
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.100]   They just treated him like dirt,
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.920]   like he was subhuman or something.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.480]   So I don't know, the culture's changed a lot.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:59.900]   And if they like it, it's good for them.
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.720]   They can enjoy their religion.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.840]   But it's not for me.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.840]   And where I like being is,
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.560]   like I had a guy who used to work for me,
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.280]   Alex Chirpinoy,
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.360]   and he created this beautiful project called Ergo.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.520]   To me, that is the spiritual successor to Bitcoin.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.940]   Ergo is really special 'cause it has the same culture,
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.400]   it has the same mentality.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.380]   And the technology is kind of like a natural evolution
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.800]   of what you would do if you knew about Bitcoin
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.760]   and you wanted to build the next big thing.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.380]   So it's still a proof-of-work system.
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.080]   It's still a UTXO system.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.440]   But he added UTXO with some smart contracts.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.520]   It's this Sigma protocol idea.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.800]   On the proof-of-work side,
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.280]   Satoshi had this one CPU, one vote idea.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:38.560]   So Alex tried to create non-also-sorcible puzzles
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.880]   to make it impossible to have mining pools.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.360]   And there's all these other beautiful little things.
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.280]   And he's this brilliant Russian programmer,
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.240]   and he surrounded himself
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.680]   with all these other brilliant people.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:48.840]   He has zero ego.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:50.320]   He has negative ego.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.720]   When you put him with a person with ego,
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.880]   your ego goes down.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.200]   And everything about Alex is always like,
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.960]   how do I solve this, how do I do that?
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.840]   And he gets legitimately excited when he meets somebody
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:04.040]   that he can collaborate with or learn from.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.600]   That's where Bitcoin was in the beginning.
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.520]   Everybody set their egos aside,
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.240]   whether it was Hal Finney or whatever,
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.560]   and they would just say, how can I help, what can I do?
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.960]   And it was all about coming up with some cool new thing
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.280]   or solving some cool new problem.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.120]   I don't see any of that in Bitcoin today.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.960]   - So quite a few people are excited about Ergo
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.560]   and excited about the fact that you
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:25.080]   kind of appreciate Alex and Ergo.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.120]   Do you see Cardano potentially utilizing
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:30.200]   the proof-of-work mechanism from Ergo
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:35.200]   as part of this pool for the consensus mechanism?
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.440]   - I mean, anything's possible.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.200]   And there's a lot of evolution Ergo has to go through.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.320]   And Ergo was, it was kind of like,
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.640]   when the Xbox 360 first came out,
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.000]   while they were prototyping it,
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.880]   Microsoft needed a development environment.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.760]   They ironically purchased a lot of Apple computers
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.400]   to do that, 'cause Apple was moving away
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:52.720]   from the PowerPC to Intel,
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.880]   and Microsoft was moving towards the PowerPC,
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.640]   just this weird intersection of history.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:59.400]   So at that time, the largest order of Mac computers made
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.120]   was done by Microsoft,
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:02.640]   and they were using it for Xbox stuff.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.240]   So Ergo, we viewed the same way.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.800]   So we said, well, we have this extended UTXO model.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.480]   The only thing that's sufficiently close to it
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.920]   where we can beta test contracts is actually with Ergo.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:15.200]   And Alex just was a little faster
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.360]   in getting certain things out,
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.800]   'cause we were doing things in a slightly more rigorous way
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.520]   and slightly more expressive way.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.040]   So we actually tested a stable coin
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.040]   and Oracle and other things on Ergo.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.760]   And it has just incredible community.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.080]   When we said, hey, we're coming here to work and build,
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.760]   oh yeah, we'd love to work with you guys.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.280]   This is so cool.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.960]   The other thing is Alex used to work for us,
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.280]   and he had this lovely project called ScoreX,
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.080]   and it was all about a pedagogical framework
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:40.520]   for building blockchains.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.720]   And if you want to do prototyping or academic research,
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.560]   it was great.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.500]   It was super modular,
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.240]   and it separated the consensus network
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.680]   and transaction layer from each other in just the right way
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.120]   so that you can make it modular and mix and match things.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.480]   So you can put secure academia in,
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.840]   or maybe a different network layer
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.760]   and a different consensus protocol,
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.360]   like proof of work to another proof of work and so forth.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.520]   So we loved having that kind of IP sitting around
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.760]   'cause it gave us the ability to kind of play around
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:07.600]   with ideas in a matter of weeks instead of months or years.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.520]   And then he just took that concept and he gave it away.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.720]   The Wave protocol was built on it.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.120]   That was Sasha Ivanov, he did that.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.360]   And I think there's two or three other cryptocurrencies
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.440]   that were launched from ScoreX.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.040]   And then Alex took that and built Ergo from it.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.640]   So there was a nice intersection
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.400]   where there was overlapping technology with Ergo,
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.600]   with our technology.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:28.960]   And the other thing was that the community
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.360]   was so open and friendly, it was just a no-brainer.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.800]   Just go in and start building some things there.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.640]   Now, in terms of evolving ideas,
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.960]   the whole Sigma protocol idea is very different,
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.080]   and it's very interesting.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.080]   And there's a guy at a Boston University,
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.680]   his name will come to me in a segment,
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.060]   who came up with this stuff.
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:48.080]   And I think there's some merit there,
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.200]   especially as we start moving closer to this idea
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.480]   of blockchains being used to validate proofs
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.680]   instead of running computation.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.200]   - What's the Sigma protocol, by the way?
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.840]   - So it's just a way of expressing scripts.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:03.200]   And basically, you get these concise representations
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.040]   of proofs, and then you can say,
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.120]   okay, the script is correct,
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.800]   but you don't have to run the whole program.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.200]   So there's a lot, I'm not doing the topic justice,
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.880]   there's a lot more to it, but that's the basic concept.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.920]   And in a Redeemer validator model,
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.000]   you need stuff like that,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000]   because as your model gets more complex
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.940]   and a lot more things happen,
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:24.200]   you don't want to have a situation where I have to run,
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.280]   replay a huge amount of the UTXO graph
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.520]   to be able to get to a point
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.000]   where I have the state of the system.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.120]   You need some mathematical artifact
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.320]   that gives you the state of the system quickly.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.960]   And then you're saying, okay, I now know how to,
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.800]   what computation thread I need to run
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.040]   to be able to get enough
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.400]   to be able to redeem this transaction.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.640]   So he just found a more compressed representation of it.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.480]   And the math doesn't matter.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.060]   What matters is there's a whole beautiful field
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.180]   that thinks about this type of stuff.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:55.160]   And it was never once linked before into our industry.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.160]   The brilliance of Alex was to actually realize
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.640]   you could do that and pull those things together.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.360]   And it may actually have some merit,
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.840]   but by no means is the only guy that does this stuff.
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.760]   There's actually other approaches in verified computing
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.920]   that have explored that.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.880]   Like my favorite came out of Microsoft research
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.280]   is a project called Pinocchio.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.000]   And there was a followup called Geppetto.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.440]   And the basic idea was that it's fortuitous
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:19.800]   that you have these computer science problems
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:24.800]   like hashing where you can do all this computation.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.360]   And once you've done all of it,
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.560]   you found this magic number that you can verify
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.640]   that the computation was done correctly.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.240]   So the proof of work works this way.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.520]   Hard to do the proof of work,
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.240]   easy to check the proof of work.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.640]   Cryptography also works this way.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.680]   You have some trap door
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.200]   where you can verify something's correct,
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.480]   but to get that thing done,
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:44.800]   if you're doing it brute force,
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.720]   it takes an enormous amount of computation.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.340]   Well, not all problems are like this,
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:49.520]   like protein folding.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.360]   To verify the protein is folded correctly,
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.360]   you have to fold the protein.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.880]   You have to redo the work.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.640]   But what if for arbitrary computation,
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.220]   you could take a problem
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.740]   and then you could generate a proof
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:01.960]   that you've done that computation correctly
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.160]   and the proof validates in logarithmic time
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:05.200]   or constant time.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.960]   Wow, that's incredible, right?
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.260]   Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.360]   It's called Pinocchio.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.240]   So that's another example of these types of things,
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:13.460]   these roll-ups of things
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:16.000]   where instead of doing the computation on chain
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.960]   or trying to create some sort of replicated machine
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.640]   that does all this stuff,
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:20.480]   you instead just say,
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.440]   okay, only thing I'm going to use the blockchain for
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.160]   is to check your proof,
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:25.000]   but I'm going to turn it
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.120]   into a distributed computing problem
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:28.820]   and any person in the world can do the problem
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:31.360]   on any server, untrusted server even,
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.400]   because you don't have to trust the output.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:36.380]   You trust the proof and the proof is deterministic.
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:37.640]   It tells you these things.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.680]   So whether you're using zero knowledge
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.960]   or Sigma protocols or some other mechanism,
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:44.240]   it's moving you in that particular direction
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.200]   to turn it from a replicated to distributed problem
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.480]   and go from I'm doing the work
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.160]   to I'm checking that the work was done correctly.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.000]   - That's fascinating.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.760]   And all of a sudden we're back to the P equals NP thing
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.260]   where for many very interesting problems,
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.760]   the checking is efficient,
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:01.680]   is much more efficient than the solving.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.000]   - Right, and also do you want complete determinism
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.800]   or is it probabilistic?
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.720]   'Cause if you relax that requirement a little bit,
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:10.440]   then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.280]   you can construct this stuff for.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.160]   - You mentioned UTXO.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:18.120]   There's a paper titled the Extended UTXO Model.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:20.400]   It writes in the introduction,
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.920]   "Bitcoin and Ethereum,
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:23.680]   hosting the two currently most valuable
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.280]   and popular cryptocurrencies,
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.040]   use two rather different ledger models,
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.440]   known as the UTXO model
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.160]   and the account model, respectively.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.720]   At the same time, these two public blockchains
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.600]   differ strongly in the expressiveness
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.120]   of the smart contracts that they support.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.360]   This is no coincidence.
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.440]   Ethereum chose the account model
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:47.640]   explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts.
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:49.920]   On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.100]   also for good reasons,
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:54.340]   including that its semantic model stays simple
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:55.480]   in a complex concurrent
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.240]   and distributed computing environment.
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:59.800]   This raises the question of whether it is possible
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:01.480]   to have expressive smart contracts
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:06.220]   while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model."
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:07.060]   Okay.
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:08.600]   - So what's the fuck that mean?
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.440]   - Exactly.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.260]   (laughing)
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.560]   What is UTXO?
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.160]   What is the account model?
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.680]   And what is the idea of the extended UTXO model?
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.520]   - So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.720]   is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.960]   So, you know, let's assume you don't have credit cards,
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:25.960]   you just have cash.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:28.560]   And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.360]   or whatever, you go to the cashier,
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.360]   you pull out your $20 bill,
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:33.240]   you give it to them,
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.200]   and let's say that comes up to 17.50,
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.520]   they have to make change.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:39.120]   So you don't tear your $20 bill
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.840]   and cut a piece of it off and say,
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.280]   "Here's part of my 20."
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:44.800]   You give them the entire $20 bill,
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.680]   and then they give you something back.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:48.020]   And the things that they give you back
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:49.320]   are also atomic units.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.000]   They don't cut those things up.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.940]   So that's kind of what UTXO is all about in a nutshell,
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.400]   is that there's inputs and outputs.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.480]   Your input's that 20,
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:59.960]   and your outputs will be the 17.50 that goes to them,
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:02.760]   and then the remaining change that goes back to you.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760]   Okay?
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.520]   The problem with this particular model
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.160]   is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin,
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:12.880]   there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates,
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.520]   complex contracts on this thing,
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:16.640]   where instead of just saying,
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.080]   "Okay, I'm just gonna push value to you,
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:21.160]   "I wanna put lots of terms and conditions
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:22.840]   "into the movement of that value."
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.000]   Like, "You only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday,"
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.500]   or, "You only get this if some event happens,
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.080]   "like the Broncos win the Super Bowl,"
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.500]   or something like that.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.340]   Okay?
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:35.400]   So you need some notion of programmability with it.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.440]   So a lot of people are trying to figure out
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.920]   in the early days of Bitcoin,
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.840]   how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.560]   And one of the ways of doing it
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.760]   is you can go to a different accounting model,
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.280]   bank-style accounting.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:50.040]   So in a bank ledger,
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.560]   every time you do a withdrawal, a deposit,
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.300]   it's a mutable system.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:55.880]   With the cash register accounting,
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.120]   you don't tear up the bills,
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.680]   but the bank, you can deduct or add
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.240]   to the ledger all the time.
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.760]   So Ethereum kinda works in that bank accounting system,
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.760]   where you send messages, you send transactions,
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:07.180]   and you're going up or down,
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:10.240]   and so you can trigger programs the same way.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.480]   So what we did is we said,
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:14.020]   "Okay, if you take the UTXO model,
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:15.540]   "and you add some data to it,
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:17.840]   "and instead of saying it's just a digital signature,
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.360]   "but it's in a script,
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.200]   "you can basically create something
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.520]   "that's still the same as cash register,
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:25.940]   "but now you have programmability,
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:28.920]   "and the big difference is local versus global."
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:32.640]   So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.800]   So whatever's going on in that cash register
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:37.900]   has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers.
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.560]   But when you look at bank accounting,
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.020]   you have to know the state of the entire banking world
[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.180]   to be able to make that work.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.020]   Why?
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.460]   Because if that transaction's inbound,
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:46.700]   that wire transfer's inbound,
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:48.220]   you have to know those funds are actually there,
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.060]   that thing is actually happening.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:52.340]   So when you have a global state for a program,
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:54.220]   it's like you could do a lot more with it,
[01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:55.380]   but it's a lot more dangerous,
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.100]   and so you have to build all these mechanisms
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.780]   to try to protect yourself from it.
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:00.000]   So what we did is we said,
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.100]   "Okay, add data, add a programmability,"
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.900]   and you're kinda in this nice Goldilocks zone
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:06.500]   between what Ethereum did with an account-style model
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.380]   and a global state system,
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:10.540]   and you're not as restrictive as Bitcoin,
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:12.140]   but you're still in a Turing-complete world,
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.060]   you can still run all kinds of things.
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.380]   And then any standard mathematician,
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:19.900]   they'll say, "Okay, well, is it isomorphic?
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.080]   Is there a mapping between this?
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.220]   What type of function?
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:25.660]   Could I actually take something expressed in one structure
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:27.480]   and transmit it to the other structure
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.820]   and properties are preserved?"
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.780]   So we wrote a paper, it was called "Chimeric Ledgers,"
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:32.660]   where we actually showed that UTXO,
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:36.380]   extended UTXO, and accounts are somewhat similar,
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.420]   in that you can map things that happen in one system
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.380]   to the other system,
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:42.500]   the properties are preserved between the two.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:45.700]   So in practice, what's nice about extended UTXO
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:48.700]   is that you can put infrastructure on top of it
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:50.380]   to make the development experience
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:52.520]   relatively similar to the development experience
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.980]   of what you would do with Ethereum,
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:58.260]   but you don't have to worry about this global state.
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.900]   So when you talk about sharding,
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.320]   it's a lot easier to do that.
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:02.720]   It's a lot more conceivable to that.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:05.240]   And also you get determinism in the system.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.020]   So when I have a Plutus smart contract,
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:08.300]   whatever I run locally
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:11.280]   is exactly what I expect to run in the system.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.660]   When you have a concept of this mutable global state
[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:15.220]   in the system, whatever you run locally
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:16.740]   is not necessarily what you're gonna get
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.780]   when you actually push it into the system.
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:21.700]   So you may misprice things and the contract will fail.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:23.940]   It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:26.300]   So you get a lot of advantages with this particular model.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.800]   The downside is that it's a little bit less expressive
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:31.960]   on the boundaries and a little bit harder
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:34.860]   to write certain types of software with it.
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:38.580]   But again, how you resolve that is you kind of build
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:40.700]   higher level languages and other such things
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:42.600]   that compensate for these types of things
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.180]   and design patterns that compensate
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.380]   for these types of things.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:46.780]   The other advantage that we have
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.740]   that's really fun and exciting is that
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:50.320]   Bitcoin lives in this model
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.740]   and there are other UTXO based systems.
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:55.380]   And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:58.620]   and they would like to continue working in the UTXO model.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:01.360]   So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things,
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.800]   there's actually already a group of people
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:04.120]   that understand this very well
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.000]   and that's still a fairly large part of the mindshare
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.380]   of the entire space.
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.800]   So there are no silver bullets
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:11.600]   and anytime you pick a particular model,
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.080]   there's an upside and a downside
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.360]   and there's different ways of doing things
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.240]   from cash register accounting or bank accounting.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.280]   You can even do different accounting models.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:22.400]   But we felt this was kind of the best first step to go into
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.680]   'cause we started with something very familiar
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.320]   that had a long history behind it
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:29.180]   and it maps very beautifully
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:30.900]   to functional programming principles.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:33.120]   This concept of immutability and these things
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.160]   and much more strict management of state
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.600]   and no notion of having this global concept
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:42.680]   that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.860]   Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:50.340]   and when they actually start real writing an application?
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:51.720]   Not too much.
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:53.240]   There's gonna be a little bit of retooling
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:54.740]   and some new patterns you have to learn,
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:56.540]   but in practice you can still do the same things.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:59.380]   You can implement a Uniswap style thing.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:00.680]   In fact, we even wrote that code
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.920]   with the Plutus Pioneers program
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.880]   so you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:05.320]   and see how that's done.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:07.960]   You can do a stable coin, you can do an Oracle,
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.060]   you can do interactive contracts.
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.140]   It's just it has to be done a little differently
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:14.340]   than the way that you would do it in an account style model.
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.660]   Just like you could run an application in Java,
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:18.680]   you can run an application in Haskell.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:20.040]   They both can do the same thing,
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.380]   but the code is gonna look different
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:25.200]   and the canonical way of looking at things is different.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.600]   - So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks,
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.080]   what are your thoughts about Chainlink
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.200]   and external off-chain data sources?
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:34.600]   And everything we've been talking about now
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.960]   with the extended UTXO model.
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:41.240]   - Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.640]   without Oracle is like trying to have sex
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:43.640]   with your pants on.
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.640]   I mean, it's not really fun.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.640]   It's not exactly the best of things.
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:49.120]   - That's the way I've been doing it all these years.
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:49.960]   I didn't know.
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:51.340]   - For any other person, Lex,
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.080]   I wouldn't believe you, but for you.
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.680]   - That's why I'm single.
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:57.120]   This makes so much sense now.
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:01.440]   - Okay, so anyway, you need the outside world
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.520]   to be ejected into your system, right?
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.320]   I'm trying to keep a straight face.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.160]   It's great.
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:09.520]   You need the outside world to make your system useful.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.080]   It's like all the kinds of things
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.040]   that you care to do with a smart contract
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.280]   usually involve human beings and information streams
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:17.440]   aggregating and doing something.
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.240]   So the Oracle is a super important component
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:22.360]   in practice for any smart contract
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.120]   involving any notion of value.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:25.500]   You need to know when things have happened,
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.920]   how they happened, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.300]   So first, where do you get the data from?
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.880]   So what's the aggregator?
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.880]   This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.320]   'cause if you know, one of the things you'll know
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.920]   about Wolfram as you get to know the guy
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.340]   is he's a data pack rat.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:41.640]   Every email, every communication, every interaction,
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:43.200]   he's archived somewhere.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.440]   Like last time I talked, he's like,
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.440]   oh yeah, I have emails from you from 2012.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:47.960]   It's like, you still have those?
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.240]   Like, yeah, every keystroke is written down
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:51.360]   and stored somewhere.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:52.760]   So if you use Wolfram Alpha,
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.180]   it's a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.480]   And so you can query the system and be like,
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.000]   oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.600]   between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:04.720]   in more than a billion dollars of cargo loss
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:06.640]   and at least one fatality?
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.200]   And it'll return an answer.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.400]   I mean, he has this incredible source of data
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.320]   that's computable.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:13.440]   - For people who don't know, Wolfram Alpha
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.400]   is more than just the thing that assists you
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.200]   with your math homework in high school.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.400]   It's actually this giant network of data
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.440]   of like weather data, of location data,
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.160]   just statistics, all kinds of,
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:26.840]   is doing the aggregation in a way
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.680]   that you can query across data sets.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.320]   And it's exactly this kind of idea.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:36.720]   It basically represents the very kind of thing
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:40.000]   you would hope to be able to query off-chain
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.560]   as part of the smart contracts.
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.600]   - Right, but the only downside is it's centralized.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:46.560]   You know, and that's always the Achilles heel
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:49.140]   of Wolfram is he tends to like proprietary things
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.640]   and he tends to like centralizing things
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.440]   and mostly 'cause he likes running the things
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:56.280]   and then, you know, everybody can have an opinion on that.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:59.680]   The thing though is that after you've done aggregation,
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.960]   there's a question of injection.
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.160]   How do you get that data into the system?
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:05.980]   And you can do that in a very naive way
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:07.160]   where you can say, oh, I'm just gonna attach
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:09.560]   a public key to it and it'll sign for that data feed,
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:13.360]   that injection, and then somehow I'll just trust it as it is
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:16.560]   or you could try to make it more complicated.
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.860]   You could weight data feeds from different sources
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:21.960]   and have some notion of truthiness or of veracity metric
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.320]   or something like that.
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.200]   So Chainlink is just one of many different philosophies
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:29.040]   that was born out of the academy.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:30.920]   I believe Ari Jewell was connected to it
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:33.000]   and there's some good people on that side.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.360]   And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate,
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:38.520]   a philosophy about how do you inject
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:39.920]   and how do you create incentives
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:43.440]   so that that process over time gets more federated
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.000]   or more decentralized instead of centralizing
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.900]   around one particular setup.
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:50.140]   Now, closely related corollary to this
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:52.920]   is computation off-chain.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.840]   So as I mentioned, smart contracts
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.680]   are intimately connected to an oracle.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.360]   The question is how much pre-processing
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.720]   and state management are you gonna do
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:02.400]   outside of the system versus what do you do
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.880]   inside of the system?
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:07.440]   So it's a very interesting balance between these two.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.640]   And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:11.600]   There's a great paper called Town Crier,
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.400]   came out way back in the day at Cornell,
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.680]   and that was all about using SGX to scrape things
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:20.800]   and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.640]   But you could also use those SGX cores
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:24.160]   to do contract processing
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:25.760]   'cause if it runs in trusted hardware,
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:28.980]   then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated.
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:31.540]   And because of that, you don't have to federate it
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:33.880]   or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:36.000]   as if it was running on a cryptocurrency.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.720]   So there seems to be a desire in that community
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.320]   to capture more and more of the smart contract stack
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:43.800]   and pull more and more of that stack
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:45.180]   into that layer two infrastructure
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.120]   from running on layer one.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:47.960]   Why?
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.160]   'Cause you have cost reduction
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:51.360]   and potentially because your trust model collapses
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.020]   to whatever Chainlink is offering,
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.400]   you're not gaining anything
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.560]   by doing the computation on Ethereum
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.600]   or another platform.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.780]   'Cause you ever watch The Simpsons?
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:04.160]   There was this beautiful episode
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.880]   where Mr. Burns wants to turn the power off in Springfield.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:09.960]   It is the perfect analogy for information security.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:11.120]   So he and Smithers,
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.520]   they go through this elaborate series of doors
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:17.040]   and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.660]   to get to the center of the power plant
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.000]   to turn off the power.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.940]   And when they arrive at the center of the plant,
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:25.360]   there's like this stray dog that's inside the room.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:26.680]   And there's this wicker door,
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:29.160]   that screen door that leads to the outside.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.600]   And you're like, well, why the hell did you go
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:32.180]   through this elaborate series of doors and things
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:34.220]   if there's like a backdoor into your system?
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:36.720]   Well, that's basically a real life analogy
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:39.480]   of the relationship between the Oracle
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.660]   and the smart contract.
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.460]   You're only as good in your infrastructure model
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:43.320]   as your weakest link.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.640]   And it doesn't matter if all of your computation
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:48.920]   is decentralized if you're at the mercy of your data feed.
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.160]   'Cause I can just manipulate that
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:52.320]   and break the entire security model of the system.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:55.440]   You know, okay, you'll perfectly execute the wrong answer.
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.280]   So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway,
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.940]   why don't you pull more of what you're doing on chain
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:00.780]   into our stack,
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:02.480]   which creates more transaction fees for them
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.120]   and more value for them.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:06.220]   But there are many different ways you can do Oracles.
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:08.520]   And earlier I was talking about the biology
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.920]   of these things, cell differentiation.
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:14.480]   The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:17.420]   and you start having cells like stake pools or things
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:19.900]   that are on and 24/7,
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:22.540]   then you can start asking the what if question.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:25.980]   Why don't you guys just also provide data feeds?
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:28.140]   Why don't you guys also provide state channels
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:29.820]   or payment channels or generate random numbers
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.020]   from here or whatever?
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.300]   And you're now a service provider.
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:33.980]   You're making the blockchain full time,
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:35.300]   but part time you're doing this.
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:36.260]   And if you're making bagels,
[02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.940]   you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept.
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:41.980]   So I think that type of competition is going to be
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:46.980]   very difficult for a lot of these layer two protocols
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:49.600]   that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.820]   Because the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol,
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:54.520]   they have a built in trust advantage.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.320]   They've already built a commercial reputation.
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.880]   There's already an increasingly more decentralized set.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.960]   The other thing is you don't need a token.
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.440]   You can just use ADA.
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:04.160]   You don't need an Oracle coin
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:05.440]   for these types of things to work.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:08.560]   And by the way, that's just for the injection component
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.580]   and the veracity attestation.
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:12.100]   So is it true or not?
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:13.780]   That's not about the aggregation.
[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.900]   That's still a tremendously time intensive,
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:17.100]   expensive proposition.
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:18.700]   There's only a few people in the world
[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:21.460]   that have what Steve has with Wolfram.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:24.920]   And those guys, by just cutting off those supply
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:26.660]   to replicate what they have is something
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:29.020]   that would cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:30.700]   And so it's an interesting question of
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:31.700]   how do you incentivize
[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.580]   decentralized aggregation of information?
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:35.220]   And that's kind of what Town Crier
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.300]   and other protocols were trying to achieve.
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.680]   - So maybe you can say how Town Crier works
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:41.800]   because it's like, what's your vision?
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:44.720]   You're now partnering with Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:49.520]   and sort of exploring this partnership of data
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.720]   and the blockchain.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:53.500]   What's your vision for a possible
[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:56.160]   distributed version of Wolfram Alpha?
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:58.320]   - Well, the first step is just say,
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:06:59.880]   can we use this as a feed?
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:02.720]   And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets.
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.420]   So you have a terminal and you have something
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:06.940]   and there's always a value of at least offering choice.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:08.640]   And so it's not like we're anti Chainlink
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.000]   or picking winners and losers.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.720]   It's an open protocol, it's an open system.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:14.320]   So if we're successful, Chainlink will migrate
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.200]   or will at least support us because they like money.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.080]   They like users, they like liquidity.
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:20.560]   It's a disservice to their community
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:23.120]   not to support a potential customer set.
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:26.360]   But you're going to have a spectrum from the desire to do
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:31.320]   a completely decentralized aggregation, curation, injection
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:34.880]   and veracity attestation to a completely centralized
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.380]   vertically integrated set.
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:38.200]   You need to be able to have that whole spectrum
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:40.400]   and offer that to the smart contract developer
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.920]   to decide what makes sense.
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:44.400]   By the way, a lot of cases,
[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.840]   they're going to be their own Oracle.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.520]   So for example, the World of Warcraft example that I gave,
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:51.240]   well, it's a completely centralized thing.
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:54.120]   It's a video game run by a single company.
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:55.600]   There's no sense in saying that we're somehow
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:56.980]   going to decentralize that.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:59.240]   What they're just trying to do is extend their currency
[02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:02.740]   or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces.
[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:07.360]   So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.840]   and the world state of that,
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:10.280]   you just have to trust Blizzard
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.020]   to inject that into the system.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:14.340]   You could try to imagine some sort of like,
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:16.940]   you know, Sentinel group of people within the game
[02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:19.840]   who keep Blizzard honest, but it's completely unnecessary
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:22.400]   because they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:26.400]   So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.600]   and cost reduction.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:30.860]   So you'd want a single feed that gets injected
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:32.200]   into the system from them.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:34.700]   If you look at a stable coin that's algorithmic
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:37.200]   and it's basing its value on the aggregation
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.920]   of many different exchanges,
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:41.280]   that's the polar opposite example.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.400]   Because there you're saying, okay,
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.480]   what's the price of my asset relative to some basket?
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.900]   But how do I know that the price feeds
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:49.400]   I'm looking at are accurate?
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.160]   You'd have to look at Binance and Bittrex
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.000]   and all these other things,
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.580]   or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:54.680]   or something like that.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:57.160]   Okay, well, how do you weight that?
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.920]   And how do you clip outliers and, you know,
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:08:59.760]   these types of things?
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.320]   That's a completely different conversation.
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:04.320]   And there's a lot more mechanics you have to put in
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.520]   for that bundling and attestation
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:08.160]   of the veracity of the data feed.
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:09.800]   And what happens if you get it wrong?
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.740]   Your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell.
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:15.840]   And, you know, the markets will eventually correct it
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.560]   for arbitrage seeking behavior,
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.600]   but anything that was built on that will fail
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.240]   in the short term.
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:23.400]   So Oracle's really just a game of, you know,
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:25.040]   you have to build a standardized interfaces
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:27.680]   and make it as easy as possible for people to do that.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:31.000]   And then let people choose how they want to inject data
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.080]   and what level of assurance do they need behind that?
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:36.240]   And the question is, how much do you leave to the user
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:38.680]   versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:40.880]   And it's a difficult design question.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.720]   For our part, you know,
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:43.920]   we love working with Steve and Wolfram
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:45.060]   and they're a great company
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:47.080]   and they really have some bright people there.
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:49.840]   And we know on the data set, they're second to none.
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.480]   Because not only do they have it, it's computable.
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.280]   You can do all kinds of things and manipulate
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:55.280]   with a very rich query language.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.480]   So that's a great thing.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:58.360]   And we want to make sure that that's accessible
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.560]   to developers and Cardano.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:01.800]   But remember, they're like Bloomberg.
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:04.280]   It's a centralized speed in that respect.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.600]   So if you want to build a Chainlink S competitor,
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:09.480]   you know, there's other protocols you could do for that.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.680]   Now you asked about Town Crier,
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:13.040]   and that was an attempt to kind of,
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:16.240]   you know, like sweep the oceans with the net, you know,
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:19.120]   get the data through a decentralized way.
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:20.840]   And that was just saying,
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:23.080]   hey, let's use trusted hardware to go read law,
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.480]   all kinds of websites and other things.
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.040]   And because it's trusted hardware,
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.480]   the scraping is non-biased.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:30.040]   You know, if you find something inconvenient
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:32.520]   to whatever the person who's scraping is,
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.160]   the trusted hardware will still do it,
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.240]   and it can't be changed.
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:37.880]   You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.320]   So that's great, but you still run into the problem
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:42.000]   of how do you wire that together?
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.920]   The underlying websites still don't have any notion
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:47.320]   of veracity or reputation behind them.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:49.440]   And then you also have the issue of storage.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.240]   Where the hell do you put all of it?
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:54.720]   If you have exabytes of data, what's the incentive for that?
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.560]   - That's the dream of the semantic web,
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:58.800]   that I still think is a fascinating idea,
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:00.400]   how to basically convert the internet
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.400]   into a knowledge base that you can query,
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:08.880]   you can integrate the same way you did with WolframAlpha,
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:11.280]   but much bigger.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:14.880]   But that means basically revolutionizing
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:17.400]   the way we put the internet together,
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:22.400]   which I think these ideas of off-chain data
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.120]   will motivate people,
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.680]   'cause there's a lot of money to be made.
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.880]   Finally, there's money to be made with a semantic web.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.800]   So that'll be an interesting kind of future.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:35.040]   I do wanna ask you about video games really quick,
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:35.960]   as a small tangent,
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.960]   'cause you've said this really interesting idea
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:40.300]   of Blizzard being centralized control.
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:44.560]   Is it possible to have items in the game
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:48.760]   that are not controlled by Blizzard?
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:49.600]   - Sure.
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:51.960]   - Being controlled in a decentralized fashion
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:53.240]   that you can, like what is it,
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:56.120]   the grandfather sword in Diablo?
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:58.080]   - Hmm, what was it really?
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.200]   Somebody was criticizing me.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.120]   I was saying all these kinds of nice things
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:04.160]   about Diablo III, and they said Diablo II Resurrected
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:05.700]   is coming out, they need to check it out.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:07.720]   There's a lot of camps and wars on the internet.
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:09.360]   - Well, come on, we both know that Diablo II
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:10.440]   is far better than Diablo III.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:11.520]   - That's what they're saying.
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:12.960]   This is the war that they're having.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:14.840]   Okay, so we'll play it.
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:15.800]   It's coming out soon.
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:17.040]   I'll play it, fine.
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:20.160]   But nevertheless, those items are owned by Blizzard.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:23.280]   Is it possible to create video games
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.040]   where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard?
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.640]   And do you think in like a half century from now,
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.240]   we will all live in those games
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:36.000]   and we'll forget the physical space even exists?
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.400]   - Well, yeah, that's definitely possible.
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:38.480]   And look at CryptoKitties.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.720]   That's a great example of that.
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:41.160]   - Can you explain what CryptoKitties is?
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:42.680]   - Well, it's basically just a video game
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:44.180]   that kind of lives on a blockchain
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:47.740]   and the creatures within the game can breed with each other
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:50.200]   and create new CryptoKitties and you can own them.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.960]   Just like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:54.360]   with lots of money behind it.
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.000]   (laughing)
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.220]   But anyway, the thing is those assets
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:00.880]   actually have a blockchain-based representation.
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:04.260]   And so whether the infrastructure that hoists up that game
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:05.800]   off-chain goes on or off,
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:09.760]   because that ledger exists outside of the game,
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:12.720]   any person can come in and replicate it, restore it,
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:14.280]   and turn it back on.
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.760]   Sans intellectual property.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:18.680]   So yeah, it's completely possible
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:20.720]   to break your architecture up
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.120]   where you have a notion of the player part
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.160]   and then you have a notion of the experience part
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:29.920]   and you can interchange experiences.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:32.240]   Almost like you do cascading style sheets or something
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:33.760]   for you to have different presentations
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:36.720]   and the ownership of the underlying layer is the players.
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.040]   So yeah, that's definitely doable.
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:39.640]   And frankly, that's what's going to happen
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:40.520]   in the gaming world.
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:42.020]   Because there's so much value in that.
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:43.560]   I mean, everybody wants to play.
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:46.200]   And right now the model is you make a game,
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.640]   you sell licenses,
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:50.440]   and you have a huge surge of people
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:52.320]   at the beginning of the game buying the video game.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:54.080]   And then you have this long tail,
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:56.400]   but you've gotten almost 95% of your value
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:57.320]   in the first six months.
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.840]   You have a huge churn rate.
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.160]   The odds are the vast majority of people
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:02.440]   won't be playing the game within 12 months.
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.160]   But if you can create an interactive game
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.160]   where there's an actual economy inside the game,
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:08.480]   then you have EVE Online or Second Life
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:09.300]   or any of these things
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.720]   where you have people playing for 10 years
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:12.600]   and there's people buying virtual real estate
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:13.720]   and all these other things.
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:14.720]   You as the game developer
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:17.640]   actually don't have to create a lot of content.
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:20.360]   So your long tail gets a lot fatter
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:21.920]   and it generates a lot more revenue
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.720]   and your cost of operating system
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:25.900]   is fairly fixed or diminishing.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.080]   So the economics align for doing exactly
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:29.680]   what you're talking about.
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:30.800]   I think it'll get done.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.280]   - Well, I just saw recently sort of this calculation
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:39.280]   that people played WoW and Fortnite for 140 billion hours.
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.420]   - Yeah.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:44.860]   - And that's without the economic incentives there.
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:46.140]   So do you think it's possible
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:48.740]   that most of our economy in the future
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:52.440]   will be people playing video games essentially?
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.500]   Okay, so one vision of the future,
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:58.180]   especially with AI and automation,
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:01.540]   that people would get wealthier and wealthier.
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:04.580]   There's this kind of rising GDP for the entire world.
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:06.780]   And then people are losing their jobs,
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:08.760]   but they're still well off enough
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:11.380]   to be able to have a high quality of life.
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:12.820]   So we're all looking for meaning
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:14.980]   and the meaning we'll find is by playing video games
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:17.180]   and now there's this extra levels.
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:19.720]   Like you can be a Bill Gates within a video game world,
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:22.620]   in the digital world as opposed to the physical world.
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:24.820]   Is that, do you think that's the future?
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:26.100]   - You just wanna have the Westworld.
[02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:27.300]   If you can't tell the difference,
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:29.420]   doesn't matter, line uttered to you.
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:32.500]   Did you ever interview Yuval Harari?
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.220]   Was he-- - Not yet, eventually.
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:35.780]   - Well, yeah, I guess, you know,
[02:15:35.780 --> 02:15:38.500]   Homo Deus, that's kind of like the roadmap there, right?
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:42.820]   This hedonistic dystopia where everybody just lives wired
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:44.980]   into some simulation.
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.420]   And there's some movies about that,
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:49.660]   Ready Player One and the other one was Surrogate
[02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:50.500]   and so forth.
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.960]   So yeah, Hollywood has certainly visualized
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:54.140]   what this could be.
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:58.340]   But you know, I'm not so pessimistic in that respect.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.140]   I do believe that the video game world
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.620]   is evolving at an amazing pace.
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.740]   If you look at where Unreal is at,
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:06.220]   it's just incredible, the latest Unreal Engine.
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:09.100]   And within one or two more ticks of that clock,
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:11.380]   the iterations, so five to 10 years,
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:13.420]   the photorealism will be so good
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:15.900]   that it'll be hard to distinguish
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:18.900]   between real life and video games.
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.980]   And you know, the hardware is almost there.
[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.940]   So the question is then,
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:25.260]   when you have photorealistic experiences
[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:27.980]   where you've successfully traversed the uncanny valley
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:29.820]   to a point where it's good enough,
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:33.960]   then will virtual reality be more desirable
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.900]   than actual reality?
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:37.180]   And for the vast majority of people,
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:38.540]   the answer is probably yes,
[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:42.100]   because actual reality is tough, it's hard.
[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:46.740]   But then your knowledge that you live in a virtual world
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.980]   actually becomes a problem for you.
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:52.180]   So there's gonna be this kind of sad, dark industry
[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:54.140]   where people try to create amnesia,
[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:55.640]   where they're not aware that they're inside
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.940]   the virtual world.
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:57.980]   And so that's an interesting--
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:16:58.820]   - Why is it sad?
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:00.380]   I mean, it's almost like--
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:02.600]   - Because you know, it's not real.
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:05.060]   But if you could forget that it's not real,
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:07.780]   then you believe what you're experiencing is real.
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:09.460]   - Yeah, but yeah, so what?
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:12.820]   You forget all the ugly parts of life,
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:14.980]   which is the physical, the meat space,
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.700]   and then you get to enjoy video games.
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:18.180]   - But it's always lurking in the back of your mind
[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:19.020]   that you're in the Matrix.
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:20.660]   You have to not be in the Matrix.
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:23.060]   That's just why the bald dude in the Matrix was like,
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:25.220]   I wanna be rich and have a beautiful wife
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:27.020]   and eat a steak every day.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:29.060]   You know, he didn't wanna know he was in the Matrix.
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:31.100]   - So you would take the red pill, not the blue pill?
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:32.780]   - Well, no, hang on.
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:33.980]   (shrieks)
[02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:36.300]   It depends on how good the virtual world is, Lek.
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:38.340]   - Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:40.980]   I mean, isn't that what most of the beautiful experiences
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:45.980]   about human life are, is forgetting for a moment,
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:48.620]   for time, like the mess of it?
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:49.460]   - Yeah.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:50.280]   - I mean, that's what love is.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:53.440]   You forget, like all of a sudden everything is beautiful.
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.460]   But like the reality is you're gonna lose that person,
[02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:57.140]   and most likely love will fade.
[02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:59.380]   And no matter what, even if it doesn't,
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:01.220]   you're both gonna be dead soon.
[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:02.260]   - Jesus Christ.
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:04.460]   (laughs)
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:06.020]   - So I'm taking the blue pill on that one.
[02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:08.020]   - You went full Ernest Becker on me, man.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:09.460]   (laughs)
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.740]   - Okay.
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.500]   - But you know, I get what you're saying, though.
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:14.900]   And actually, but then it begs the question,
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:17.020]   how do we, and goes back to the very first question
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.500]   you asked in this interview, which is like,
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:20.020]   how do we know we're not in a simulation?
[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:22.860]   Or, you know, is Bostrom's concepts
[02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:24.740]   or these ideas like real?
[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:26.580]   Well, it's entirely possible that we are
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:30.020]   and that we desire to be because the real world
[02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:32.260]   is horrifically dystopian or bad,
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:34.180]   or maybe we actually don't exist,
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.660]   we're completely virtual, and does it matter?
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:38.300]   And I'd argue that it probably doesn't
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:40.140]   at some certain point.
[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:41.460]   If you're at the end of your life
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:43.620]   in your 90s dying of cancer,
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:45.860]   the fact that you can live out being young, healthy,
[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:48.140]   and 25 is probably a desirable thing,
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:50.120]   and no one would ever complain about that.
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:53.220]   Where it becomes problematic is if the vast majority
[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:57.660]   of society enters this virtual simulacra of reality,
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:18:59.700]   and as a consequence, nothing works
[02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:01.300]   because there's no one to do anything.
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:03.660]   Society falls apart in that respect.
[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:05.860]   There's no desire to do anything in the real world.
[02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:09.180]   Innovation stops, the desire to actually do real work stops,
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:12.380]   'cause you're always inside this virtual economy.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:14.740]   So I don't know, it's an interesting question,
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.660]   but drawing it back more to where we're at today,
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:20.500]   the evolution factors are there.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:22.940]   VR is evolving at a very rapid rate,
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:25.820]   the game engines are just incredible today,
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:27.900]   and they're really doing amazing things,
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.660]   and there seems to be an overwhelming desire
[02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:33.440]   for people to escape the harshness of where they live,
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:36.020]   just by evidence by how many billions of hours
[02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:37.340]   have been spent playing video games.
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:38.980]   People still play Skyrim.
[02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:41.100]   - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, it's a good game.
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:42.900]   - It's probably my favorite game
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:44.620]   of the whole Elder Scrolls series,
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:47.820]   but it's fascinating because smart contracts
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:49.640]   is actually the mechanism by which we take
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.700]   a lot of the meatspace stuff and move it to the digital world
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:55.700]   so that all the stuff we've been talking about
[02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:59.660]   is really probably the mechanisms which take us there,
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:03.060]   which I find that world not dystopian,
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:04.300]   I find that world quite utopian,
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:05.460]   'cause there's so many opportunities
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:07.200]   to create beautiful experiences.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:11.300]   But since we're talking about the future,
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:13.140]   let me ask you the timeline question,
[02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:16.700]   or even just like definitional, what is Alonzo?
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:20.900]   You mentioned some fun hello world experiments going on.
[02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:22.220]   - Right.
[02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:26.340]   - And how and when will Cardano get smart contracts?
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:29.420]   - Yeah, so Alonzo Church is a famous, famous mathematician,
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:32.220]   computer science guy, and he was a contemporary of Turing,
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.940]   and there was like these three different views of computing,
[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:36.500]   recursive functions from Godel
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.860]   and Turing machines from Turing,
[02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:40.660]   and Church had lambda calculus, and they're all equivalent,
[02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:42.840]   and they all give you the ability to build a computer.
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:46.020]   So we like functional programming, so we decided--
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:47.820]   - That's your favorite Church.
[02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:49.420]   - So we had to name something after Church,
[02:20:49.420 --> 02:20:52.060]   and it's just weird that we never did,
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:54.620]   so we said, okay, Alonzo is a good release name.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.620]   Basically, it was bringing smart contracts to Cardano.
[02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:58.180]   Took us a long time to get here,
[02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:00.180]   and we'll be there in the next 90 days.
[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:03.980]   Like everything we do, there's a process,
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.700]   and so there's all the colors of the rainbow.
[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:09.460]   We start with Alonzo blue, and then white, and purple,
[02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:11.260]   and each step, you do some more things,
[02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:12.620]   you bring more users in,
[02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:14.420]   and then eventually you get to a threshold
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:17.020]   where you say, okay, everything works the way intended,
[02:21:17.020 --> 02:21:18.220]   and you push a button,
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.180]   and we initiate what's called a hard-for-combinator event,
[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:22.700]   and boom, the system has smart contracts.
[02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:24.260]   You just wake up, and it's there.
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:25.820]   It's like it's in your house.
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:26.660]   - So it's gonna be a hard fork.
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:28.140]   - It's like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter.
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:29.460]   I woke up, and I had it.
[02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:30.300]   It was just like Christmas came.
[02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:32.300]   - And you were never the same.
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.200]   You can't go back.
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:34.780]   It's like hard fork.
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:36.060]   It's a hard fork of Charles.
[02:21:36.060 --> 02:21:36.900]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:37.740]   - You've got blue.
[02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.780]   Well, actually, I think you can take it away, but--
[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:41.700]   - Can they take my check mark away, Flex?
[02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:44.020]   (laughing)
[02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:47.380]   - But that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:48.940]   Okay, so great.
[02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:55.020]   But currently, there's a testing procedure going on
[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:58.500]   to see what does that look like,
[02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:00.060]   and what will give you confidence
[02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:00.940]   that things are working well.
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:02.920]   - Yeah, so first, you start with the Meri-era,
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:04.860]   which is where we're right now multi-asset.
[02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:08.060]   So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano,
[02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:11.140]   but you'd have limited programmability on-chain.
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:13.260]   Alonzo adds the programmability in,
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:15.180]   but we already have most of the foundations
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:16.500]   of the extended UTXO model,
[02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:17.900]   and the smart contract model is just,
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:19.300]   those things aren't ready.
[02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:21.460]   So the first step is say, fork it,
[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:23.740]   so all those rules are now there, okay?
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:25.420]   That's what we did with Alonzo Blue.
[02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:27.820]   We forked a testnet-based layer,
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:31.760]   and it successfully survived going from Meri to Alonzo,
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:33.380]   which means that you can move transactions
[02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:35.780]   from one side to the other, both systems work.
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:37.780]   And then the next step is say, okay, well,
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:39.020]   are the stake pool operators,
[02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:40.180]   people who run the infrastructure,
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:42.820]   able to run this testnet just like they run Cardano?
[02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:44.180]   And that's what we're doing right now with Blue.
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:45.940]   We're bringing all these SPOs in,
[02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:47.420]   and then are we able to submit
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:49.460]   and run smart contracts on the system?
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:51.260]   And they actually return a round trip.
[02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:53.000]   You send something, you get something back.
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.760]   Yay, okay.
[02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:55.600]   So that's where we're at.
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:57.720]   And then what you do is each step,
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:58.900]   so the next is white,
[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:01.540]   you go from like 50 people to several hundred,
[02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:03.860]   and then purple's an open testnet,
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:05.660]   where we want every single person
[02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:07.060]   in the entire ecosystem to use it.
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.660]   It's also a devnet, so that means that people
[02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:11.500]   who are writing with Clues Playground
[02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:14.180]   and local interpreters, their smart contracts
[02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:15.980]   can actually start testing them now
[02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:17.420]   on the public infrastructure.
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:20.540]   So it's kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:21.380]   or something like that.
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:22.780]   You send them out to game developers
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:23.940]   before you release the Xbox,
[02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:25.300]   so they can test their video games
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:27.940]   in anticipation of the release of the system.
[02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:29.340]   So you run that for at least a month.
[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:31.700]   And as long as it doesn't blow up in your face,
[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:33.020]   and oh God, what have we done?
[02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:35.240]   Hindenburg, oh, the humanity.
[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:37.460]   You release it, and you ship it.
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:39.620]   The problem is it's no longer in our control.
[02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:42.260]   There's over a hundred exchanges that have listed Cardano.
[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:43.760]   There's lots of wallet infrastructure.
[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:45.940]   There are thousands of different constituencies.
[02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:48.980]   So it's less of a technological problem now,
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:50.980]   and it's more of a coordination problem.
[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:54.620]   So you have to evolve in a very methodical way,
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:56.780]   and each step of the way you bring new actors in,
[02:23:56.780 --> 02:23:57.980]   they get ready for it.
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:23:59.760]   They upgrade their infrastructure to it,
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.860]   and then like shells, eventually,
[02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:03.340]   you get to the outer shell,
[02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:05.260]   which is the hard fork for the general public.
[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:08.260]   And if we've done it right, like that blue check mark,
[02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:10.660]   they wake up, and it's exactly the same.
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:13.420]   They just get a little update thing, update your client.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:16.020]   And then they start demanding Wagyu beef.
[02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:17.460]   - Is there stuff you're worried about
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:21.000]   in terms of like when something's this tricky,
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:25.620]   goes up several orders of magnitude in terms of scale?
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:27.420]   Are there problems that you foresee?
[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:30.900]   Is there, like we said, there's game theoretic aspects,
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:32.340]   all those kinds of things.
[02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:33.820]   Like what worries you the most?
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:35.420]   - I mean, I sleep like a baby.
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.100]   I wake up every two hours crying.
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:39.360]   (laughing)
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.660]   - Damn, that's a good line.
[02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:42.920]   You're full of good lines.
[02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:45.260]   - I mean, there's a lot that--
[02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:47.780]   - You just made me realize that expression makes no sense.
[02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:50.020]   I sleep like a baby, but go ahead.
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:51.700]   - Yeah, exactly right.
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:53.940]   Messing your whole world up right now, Alex.
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:56.780]   No, I mean, there's so much that keeps me up at night.
[02:24:56.780 --> 02:24:58.960]   You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat every day
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:00.540]   when you have an ecosystem like this,
[02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:03.480]   'cause the other thing is you're judged as much
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.420]   by the applications people build on the platform as you are
[02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:08.260]   by the platform you've constructed.
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:10.500]   So, you know, one of the most unfair things
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.860]   that happened in our industry
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:14.540]   was blaming Vitalik for the DAO hack.
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.500]   He didn't write the code, he wasn't responsible for it.
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:18.620]   A completely independent, different team.
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:19.580]   And because it blew up,
[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:21.260]   a lot of people just developed this idea,
[02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:24.220]   Ethereum is not secure, the EVM is fundamentally broken.
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:25.900]   And it's true there are some issues there,
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:28.140]   but come on, that's like saying,
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:31.460]   oh, well, Photoshop didn't work, fuck Bill Gates.
[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:32.300]   - Yeah.
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:34.800]   - And that's the issue is you get,
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:36.640]   as a platform developer,
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:40.020]   coupled with the wins and losses
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:41.220]   of your application developer.
[02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:43.740]   So if they go do amazing things, it's like,
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:45.780]   oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it.
[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:47.300]   And if they go do terrible things, they're like,
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.300]   oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us.
[02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:53.260]   So what we're kept up at night about
[02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:55.100]   is not just what we've constructed,
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:58.020]   but also how do we curate an ecosystem
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:59.700]   and foster the development of an ecosystem
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:02.020]   where you have assurance baked into the application
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:04.360]   and that's somehow expressible to the user.
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:06.520]   So when you download your smart contract
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:07.980]   or you click your one-click install
[02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:10.700]   to use your Uniswap clone or whatever the hell it is
[02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:12.420]   that's deployed on Cardano,
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:13.660]   you have a little green check mark
[02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:15.020]   or something that indicates to you
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:16.500]   that somebody audited the code
[02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:18.260]   or it followed a specification.
[02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:19.940]   The lack of that is problematic
[02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:22.520]   because then first there's impersonations,
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:23.900]   the whole MyEtherWallet thing,
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:26.180]   or like your videos or my videos are the same.
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:28.220]   Every comment there's a bot that says,
[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:30.780]   hey, give me some money or something like that.
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:31.880]   That kind of stuff happens.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:34.060]   But then just protocol level flaws,
[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:35.740]   like what happened with the DAO hack.
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:37.140]   That's what really keeps me up at night
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:38.900]   is how do you resolve that problem?
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:40.500]   'Cause I don't hire these people,
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:41.740]   I don't tell them what to do,
[02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:44.300]   I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform.
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.140]   They may have tons of experience and knowledge,
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.700]   they could be Simon Payton Jones
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:50.460]   or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:51.540]   and they read one tutorial
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:53.860]   and they've written three lines of code their entire life
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:56.660]   and they've deployed something horribly broken copy paste
[02:26:56.660 --> 02:26:58.100]   and suddenly it all goes to hell.
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:00.140]   I'm judged by both.
[02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:01.620]   That's what really keeps me up at night.
[02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:03.620]   And we're as a company trying to figure out
[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:06.300]   and as the ecosystem trying to figure out standards,
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:07.480]   like at University of Wyoming,
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:10.480]   we're setting up the Smart Contract Engineering Institute
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:12.140]   we're negotiating with them right now.
[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:14.940]   And the goal there is just to create some standards
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:17.500]   for how to certify smart contracts
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:19.220]   so that you can get that green check mark
[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:22.540]   and know that it actually has some assurance level behind it.
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:24.940]   But God, that's a huge coordination problem
[02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:27.100]   and it's a huge information presentation problem
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:29.060]   and incentives problem and so forth.
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.940]   And unfortunately people who value being first to market
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:35.140]   will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else.
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:37.460]   - In terms of maybe you can comment
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:40.680]   on the topic of decentralized exchanges.
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:43.920]   What kind of decentralized exchanges Dex is?
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:45.020]   What are they first of all?
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:48.800]   And what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:51.080]   - Yeah, so people want to create exchanges
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:53.000]   that don't have custodial risk.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.760]   The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:57.880]   where bids and ask can find each other.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.420]   Market people can meet and trade.
[02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:02.460]   You can find a price and you can get liquidity.
[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:05.840]   So you got gold, you wanna turn your gold into dollars.
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:08.160]   Okay, well somebody has to create a marketplace for that.
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:10.520]   - So like Coinbase is an example of a marketplace
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:11.360]   but it's centralized.
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.120]   - But the problem is you have custodial risk.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.200]   So when you put your gold and your dollars,
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.320]   your digital representations of these things
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.700]   into the exchange, what if Wally,
[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:24.340]   Eve broke up with him and now he's really sad
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:25.960]   and he's gone to the dark side
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:27.700]   and he's become Wally the hacker.
[02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:29.500]   Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:32.120]   and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:32.960]   and your tokens.
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:34.780]   So instead of you actually being able to swap these things,
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:36.360]   you've lost all your money.
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:37.400]   And there's other problems too.
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:38.680]   Like let's say, you know,
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:42.460]   Daisy has now come in and become a regulator
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:44.320]   and said, "Oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:46.120]   "I'm just gonna shut them all down."
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:47.680]   Yeah, and then you have no access to it.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.080]   So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat,
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:53.040]   you have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.400]   maybe cutting you out.
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:57.280]   So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years.
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:59.560]   Mount Gox was the most famous example of that.
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:01.920]   They collapsed, I believe, in 2013
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:05.060]   and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:06.620]   over the course of a while.
[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:07.980]   So the point of ADEX is saying,
[02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:10.960]   can we do what a marketplace does,
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:13.300]   but not have Coinbase,
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:16.020]   not have a central actor run this thing?
[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:17.580]   And there's a lot of problems with that
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:22.020]   because exchanges are generally creatures of latency.
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:24.300]   You know, high frequency trading, for example,
[02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:25.620]   these things that nanosecond,
[02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:27.620]   they co-locate their infrastructure
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:28.900]   with the exchange software
[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:31.460]   just so they can front run orders over other people.
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:33.560]   I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:34.540]   that they put in.
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:37.480]   So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:40.400]   is very centralized, very fast, very optimized,
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:44.320]   and kind of behaves by a very closed set of rules.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:45.440]   When you look at ADEX,
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:47.320]   you have to accept that you're going to have
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:48.960]   to have slightly different rules
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:52.540]   because you're operating in a global systems latency
[02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:53.680]   and you're operating in a system
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:55.280]   that has different behaviors.
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.320]   However, that said, there's a lot of great protocols
[02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:58.160]   that have been built for it.
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:01.200]   You know, Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.940]   And we've seen a huge competition
[02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:07.420]   and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols
[02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:09.060]   that kind of excuse some of these security problems,
[02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:10.580]   enjoy high liquidity,
[02:30:10.580 --> 02:30:15.060]   and then also have this beautiful concept of openness.
[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.500]   One of the gatekeepers to crypto
[02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:19.220]   when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges.
[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:21.060]   I remember when we first created Cardano,
[02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:23.180]   you know, the Bitfinex guys
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.580]   reached out to the Cardano Foundation.
[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:26.860]   They said, "Oh, we'd be happy to list ADA."
[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:27.940]   I said, "Okay."
[02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:30.980]   And they said, "Yeah, we want $5 million to do it."
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:33.720]   You know, so there was kind of some Italian
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:36.640]   for go fuck yourself in those email conversations.
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:38.260]   Fuck, fulo is what I said.
[02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:41.820]   But anyway, that kind of back and forth
[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:42.900]   happens all the time.
[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.620]   And because these guys are gatekeepers,
[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:46.420]   they have this nepotistic control,
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:48.480]   information asymmetries, and so forth.
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:50.720]   So having a DEX, you don't have that problem.
[02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:52.160]   You have open listing.
[02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:54.400]   And you basically just put the asset into it.
[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:56.920]   And if anybody wants to trade it, they will.
[02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:58.600]   And if it seems like it's a good idea,
[02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:00.740]   a natural market will form, market making will occur,
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.000]   and you get liquidity with it.
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.160]   So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system.
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:08.720]   The biggest existential problem for DEXs right now
[02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:10.880]   is the concept of regulation.
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:13.820]   So basically, right now, when you use Binance,
[02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:15.400]   or Coinbase, or these other guys,
[02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:17.000]   you have to go through KYC and AML,
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.960]   know your customer, and anti-money laundering.
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:22.200]   So basically, who are you, and is your money real or not,
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:24.240]   or are you a drug dealer or something?
[02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:26.120]   So normally you do that by saying,
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:29.040]   "Okay, I'm gonna give them a copy of my passport,
[02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.180]   "and maybe they're gonna request some tax records,"
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:32.680]   or whatever the best practices are
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:34.540]   for the particular jurisdiction.
[02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:37.840]   And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up.
[02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:39.840]   So if the government comes in and says,
[02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:43.280]   "Hey guys, we pull your compliance records,"
[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:44.600]   and they find discrepancies,
[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:46.360]   they'll actually put the exchange out of business
[02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:48.340]   or fine them very heavily.
[02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:52.240]   JPMorgan Chase got $19 billion in fines
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:55.000]   over the last 20 years for various compliance issues,
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.260]   amongst other things.
[02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:59.200]   So it's expensive, a very difficult thing.
[02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:01.240]   And at DEX, it's an open system.
[02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:03.620]   You just have value coming in, not identity.
[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:04.960]   And so all these things are trading
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:06.440]   amongst pseudonymous accounts,
[02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:09.240]   and so there's no notion of compliance right now for that.
[02:32:09.240 --> 02:32:11.280]   So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying,
[02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:13.880]   "Oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism
[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:15.280]   "and drug dealing and bad stuff."
[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:18.200]   And they're a word salad of bullshit.
[02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:20.300]   But it is what it is, you have to deal with these guys.
[02:32:20.300 --> 02:32:22.440]   And so there's been a lot of discussions of,
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:25.440]   "Can we take DEXs and keep the openness
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:27.000]   "and keep the liquidity
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.700]   "and no counterpart or custodial risk?
[02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.680]   "And can we add some notion of compliance to that
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:33.840]   "in a decentralized way
[02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:37.180]   "that doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper?"
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:39.060]   So I think actually by combining DIDS,
[02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:41.100]   decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it,
[02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:43.380]   but it's actually the next generation of the technology
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:44.620]   is the regulated DEX.
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:47.580]   And who regulates that, how does that work, and so forth.
[02:32:47.580 --> 02:32:48.420]   But I think ultimately,
[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:50.020]   those are gonna be the only marketplaces
[02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:54.100]   that end up surviving in this current environment
[02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:56.480]   if your desire is to exit to a dollar.
[02:32:56.480 --> 02:32:59.080]   If you don't really care about the fiat side,
[02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:00.960]   like a traditional legacy currency,
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:05.280]   you can always do things in a shadowy, unregulated way.
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.680]   But I mean, it's a personal preference
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:08.920]   and a business preference.
[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:13.560]   - Can we kind of return to proof of work and proof of stake?
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:15.760]   There's just so many topics I wanna talk to you about,
[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:17.700]   so I'll jump around a little bit.
[02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:21.440]   But at the Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey spoke,
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:25.020]   I think, I believe he said, "Bitcoin changes everything."
[02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:27.340]   I think you made a video for Jack,
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:30.140]   trying to explain different ideas to him,
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:32.700]   I guess describing the difference between proof of work
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:35.100]   and proof of stake, as we've talked about.
[02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:37.140]   What do you hope Jack Dorsey comes to understand
[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:40.660]   about the difference between proof of work and proof of stake?
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:42.860]   - Well, I hope he understands it's just a resource.
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:45.020]   That's the entire point of the video I was trying to make,
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:47.380]   is like, dude, you're like in this cult
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:49.820]   where you think the only way to be secure is proof of work,
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:52.900]   or somehow proof of stake is less secure than proof of work.
[02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:55.420]   I don't even know how you put those inequalities there,
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:57.660]   'cause you're talking about apples and oranges.
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:59.500]   You're making different trade-offs,
[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:00.500]   and there's different assumptions
[02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:02.700]   about the nature of the people involved,
[02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:04.620]   but the mechanics are the same.
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:06.700]   And so it's really more of a question of,
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:08.500]   what type of system do you prefer?
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:10.440]   Do you want mercenaries guarding Rome,
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:13.100]   or do you want Roman citizens guarding Rome?
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:14.280]   Okay, and as the Romans learn,
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:16.860]   it's better to have citizens usually doing that.
[02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:19.300]   Okay, and that's the only point I was trying to make
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:22.460]   to Dorsey, and I don't think he watched it
[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.380]   or particularly cared,
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:26.620]   but it was more of a video for everyone,
[02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:29.340]   and to start that dialogue of realizing
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:31.220]   that the real game is not,
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:33.340]   is proof of stake better than proof of work?
[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:36.380]   It's how do we go from one to N, and what should N be?
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:38.660]   You just mentioned that semantical addressable web,
[02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:41.740]   going back to IPFS and these other concepts.
[02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:44.620]   Well, how do you pay for the enormous burden
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:46.180]   of storing that much data?
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:48.140]   You can create a consensus protocol for it.
[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:48.980]   There actually is one.
[02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:50.060]   It's called Permacoin.
[02:34:50.060 --> 02:34:51.820]   Came out in 2014, '15.
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:54.460]   Andrew Miller wrote it, and a few other authors.
[02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:57.900]   I think our John Katz may have been an author as well,
[02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:00.100]   but basically it was just a throwaway
[02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:02.020]   proof of work style algorithm
[02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:05.620]   that only works if you have large amounts of data.
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:08.620]   Okay, so it's like your miners are like a hard drive,
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:09.700]   effectively.
[02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:11.180]   - Proof of storage, I think you call it.
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:12.780]   - Yeah, this type of stuff,
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:14.700]   and there's been since then many iterations,
[02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:17.020]   evolutions of that type of protocol.
[02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:20.220]   Okay, so what if you throw that into your resource bag?
[02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:22.580]   Now you have a capacity in your system
[02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:24.860]   for storing huge amounts of information
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:27.100]   that's incentivized by the way the system works,
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:29.260]   and you can balance that with a proof of stake system,
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:31.220]   and you can balance that with,
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:33.860]   let's say you have proof of useful computation.
[02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:35.980]   We may have a paper on that, who knows?
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:37.340]   Coming soon.
[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:39.300]   And what if you have a proof of useful computation
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:41.660]   where maybe you can do walk stat or something, who knows?
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:43.180]   With something like that, okay,
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:45.780]   well now you have three resources inside your system,
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:47.740]   and those three things keep your system secure,
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.740]   they keep each other balanced,
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:50.300]   and they just so happen to create
[02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:53.060]   the world's largest supercomputer that's programmable,
[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:54.260]   and it just so happens to create
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:56.680]   the world's largest database that's programmable,
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:59.620]   in addition to having a shareholder-style model
[02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:00.740]   for ownership inside of it
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:02.100]   to kind of balance these things out
[02:36:02.100 --> 02:36:04.300]   so people care about the appreciation of value
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:05.500]   inside the system.
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:06.660]   So that was my point to Jack,
[02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:09.780]   is you're a business guy, why are you betting all your eggs?
[02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:12.380]   And one crazy model that's a cult,
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:14.940]   step away and realize that that does something.
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:18.420]   It's a tool, but saws aren't the only tool in the toolbox.
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:20.660]   There's hammers and screwdrivers and other things.
[02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:23.500]   Go to end resources, and let's have a real conversation
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:26.980]   about what would a world computer or a world infrastructure
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:28.900]   that's useful for your business domain,
[02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:31.580]   in this case Twitter, require?
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:33.220]   And what type of resources would you need
[02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:34.060]   for such a thing?
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.420]   - Well in this case, Square, more importantly.
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.260]   Currently, if you look at Square and Cash App,
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:41.100]   they support Bitcoin.
[02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:44.260]   He is kind of all in on the proof of work idea.
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:46.380]   Not all in, but currently kind of,
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:48.580]   that's the one supported idea.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:51.180]   - I guess there's no just a tip in proof of work.
[02:36:51.180 --> 02:36:53.060]   (laughing)
[02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:54.460]   - I love you so much, Charles.
[02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:55.940]   (laughing)
[02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:57.500]   Thank you, appreciate this.
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:02.220]   But I'm not gonna run with that, even though I'm tempted to,
[02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:05.980]   but looking forward, do you hope Cardano
[02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:07.860]   becomes part of Cash App?
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:10.540]   - I mean, he's a business guy, or at least I'd hope he is,
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:13.020]   and it's not about what I want or what he wants,
[02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:14.620]   it's about what markets want.
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:16.660]   When you run a publicly traded company,
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:18.660]   you have a fiduciary obligation to your shareholders
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:21.820]   to maximize the utility, the sustainability
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:23.460]   and value of your company.
[02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:27.320]   And so if he's running a company that makes money
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:29.700]   off of these things, it makes absolutely no sense
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:30.980]   to be a maximalist.
[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:32.220]   You want transaction volume,
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:33.380]   that's how you make your damn money.
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:34.700]   It was, Coinbase was the same way.
[02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:36.940]   They were very maximalist in the beginning.
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:38.420]   Very quickly, they started realizing,
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:39.940]   hey, we're losing a lot of money.
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:43.340]   If we want to IPO, we kind of need to be a bit more diverse.
[02:37:43.340 --> 02:37:46.100]   Eric Voorhees was also a maximalist way back today.
[02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:47.780]   And now look at Eric, he's got Shapeshift
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:49.940]   and all these other pieces of infrastructure.
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:52.420]   He's a lot more friendly with us ultis.
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:55.140]   So, you know, Jack will make that decision.
[02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:56.940]   His people will make that decision, I think,
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:59.300]   based on market dynamics, transaction volume
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:01.540]   and value to the user.
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:04.660]   And if the concern is actually legitimately security,
[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:06.700]   then the only question I'd ask their team is,
[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:09.440]   can you please provide me a definition of one?
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:14.440]   Doing POW is more secure than proof of stake as a tweet
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:16.340]   is not really a proof, okay?
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:18.140]   You need to actually come out and sit down and say,
[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:19.460]   what is your security model?
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:20.540]   What do you care about?
[02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:21.380]   What do you value?
[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:23.940]   What's the problems you're concerned about at proof of stake?
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:25.420]   And they never really get there.
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:28.420]   And that's why I call this maximally like a religion,
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:30.140]   because it's just like saying,
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:32.300]   you know, the angels descended from the heavens.
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.460]   And it's like, well, how do you know?
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:36.180]   Because the Bible said so, or this doctrine said so.
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:37.540]   It's like, well, that's your evidence?
[02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:39.220]   Somebody wrote something down?
[02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:41.140]   Can you please give me a little bit more?
[02:38:41.140 --> 02:38:43.580]   They say, no, you're challenging the word of God.
[02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:45.980]   In this case, you're challenging the word of Satoshi.
[02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:48.340]   And all I ask for is just what is the burden of proof?
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:50.680]   We wrote the papers, we have security models,
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:52.060]   we went through the peer review process.
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:53.760]   God, that was not easy.
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:55.420]   We wrote formal specifications.
[02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:57.580]   In some cases, we formalize those specifications
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:00.900]   with Isabel, for God's sakes, which is not easy to do.
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:03.180]   And then we implemented it, and it's running in production
[02:39:03.180 --> 02:39:06.140]   with a million users at a $50 billion market cap.
[02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:08.900]   I mean, at what point do you start saying,
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:11.020]   well, maybe there's something there?
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:12.660]   And they say, no, there's nothing there,
[02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:14.260]   and it's not secure, it can't be secure.
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:17.220]   And you say, okay, then why do you believe what you believe?
[02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:19.900]   And they never come back to me with an answer, ever.
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:21.340]   - Well, I believe God didn't go through
[02:39:21.340 --> 02:39:23.580]   a peer review process when he wrote the 10 Commandments,
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:28.020]   so sometimes it works out, sometimes not.
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:30.020]   Let me ask on that same thread.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:34.900]   Tesla, SpaceX, Elon Musk currently invest in Bitcoin,
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:37.020]   but are openly looking to explore
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:39.540]   other cryptocurrency investments.
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:41.900]   What case would you make for Cardano?
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:43.860]   - Well, if they truly care about alternative energy
[02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:47.740]   and sustainability, carbon reduction or carbon neutrality,
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:52.740]   you can't be in a system where there is no built-in mechanism
[02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:55.380]   to constrain the energy consumption.
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:58.820]   With proof of stake, energy consumption is a negative.
[02:39:58.820 --> 02:39:59.940]   You wanna minimize it.
[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:01.700]   If you can get the same amount of stuff done
[02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:03.740]   on a Raspberry Pi as you can a big server,
[02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:05.220]   you're gonna do it on the Pi,
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:07.900]   'cause ultimately that server cost and that energy cost
[02:40:07.900 --> 02:40:09.300]   is coming out of your budget.
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:11.980]   With proof of work, any innovation you come up with
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:16.300]   to optimize power, you just build more ASICs.
[02:40:16.300 --> 02:40:18.780]   'Cause, you know, oh, it's 30% more power efficient.
[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:20.940]   Great, buy 30% more.
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:23.900]   You keep adding to the work set,
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:25.340]   'cause you want more hash power.
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:27.820]   More hash power, more share of the Pi.
[02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:30.140]   So you have no energy savings component.
[02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:30.980]   And I know these people are saying,
[02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:33.500]   well, there's a lot of wasted energy in the grid,
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:37.300]   and this is kind of incentivizing using that wasted energy,
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:39.460]   and it's a better way of storing it than batteries,
[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:41.140]   'cause you're now storing it as a Bitcoin
[02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:42.620]   instead of storing it as energy.
[02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:44.660]   Okay, maybe there's some truth to that.
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:47.740]   But anyway, it's just--
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:50.140]   - The energy is a critical point for you.
[02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:52.540]   Like the-- - Yeah, and that's exactly right.
[02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:55.740]   The energy is a critical point for me with Tesla,
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:58.940]   'cause they assert to be an alternative energy company.
[02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:00.660]   And unless they can make the case
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:02.300]   that somehow the proliferation of Bitcoin
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:04.460]   is legitimately going to proliferate batteries,
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:06.940]   solar, and wind, or other things,
[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:09.300]   then it's probably good for them to just focus
[02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:11.020]   on the most efficient,
[02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:13.140]   energy efficient cryptocurrency possible.
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:15.300]   Otherwise, you're exacerbating global warming.
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:18.180]   You're exacerbating the ecological consequences of it.
[02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:20.380]   The other thing is Bitcoin is the least programmable
[02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:21.700]   of all the cryptocurrencies.
[02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:24.300]   And if you wanna do interesting, sexy, unique things,
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:26.540]   let's say Tesla, for example,
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:28.500]   they wanna start doing V to I and V to V
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:30.900]   for autonomous vehicles,
[02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:32.500]   and have the vehicles start talking to each other
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:33.900]   and connect it to 5G.
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:35.780]   Well, imagine if you wanna build a telco coin,
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:37.660]   or some sort of 5G coin,
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:40.340]   and you wanna build an IoT layer and network.
[02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:42.820]   There's just no real way to do that on Bitcoin
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:44.140]   with the way it's designed.
[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:46.460]   So you'd need fundamentally different infrastructure
[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:49.460]   to create such a token and regulate such a system,
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:51.980]   and have these things autonomously negotiate
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:52.940]   and do business with each other.
[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:54.860]   You need DEXs and stable coins,
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.340]   and all kinds of mechanics
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:58.340]   to make something like that possible.
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:00.180]   Well, that's really beneficial to Tesla
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:01.580]   if they could figure that out.
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:02.420]   'Cause they could create
[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.300]   an information-sharing incentive scheme
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:05.640]   where if the cars talk to each other,
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:08.860]   including other branded cars, like GM cars and Fords,
[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:10.900]   they can now actually get data from those cars
[02:42:10.900 --> 02:42:12.500]   through a marketplace and exchange
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:14.380]   for the benefit of autonomous driving,
[02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:16.340]   or for the benefit of understanding road conditions,
[02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:18.180]   or safety enhancement, and so forth.
[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:19.220]   So it's just depending.
[02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:20.580]   Are you just here to speculate?
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:22.220]   Are you here to actually use it
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:23.620]   as another medium of exchange?
[02:42:23.620 --> 02:42:26.380]   Or do you actually wanna build infrastructure on this thing?
[02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:29.020]   The more closely you get to utility,
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.300]   the further down the road you get there,
[02:42:31.300 --> 02:42:33.700]   then the more programmability you need.
[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:36.260]   And so it makes a lot more sense to be an Ethereum fan
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:38.900]   or a Cardano fan than to be a Bitcoin fan.
[02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:40.780]   - So to be both proof of stake
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:42.720]   and have the smart contracts capabilities.
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:43.980]   - Yes.
[02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:45.340]   And that's why we went over to Ethereum,
[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:46.780]   'cause they're proof of work.
[02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:49.020]   - You mentioned God.
[02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:51.040]   God spelled backwards as dog.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:53.960]   How's that for a transition?
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:55.700]   (laughing)
[02:42:55.740 --> 02:43:00.740]   And Elon Musk and Tesla are at least a little bit curious
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:04.460]   about a coin called Dogecoin.
[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:06.380]   You made a video directed to Elon
[02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:08.420]   on how to improve Dogecoin.
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:11.980]   What are your ideas for making Dogecoin
[02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:14.040]   even better than it already is?
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:16.500]   - Well, you know, Dogecoin is just based,
[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:18.540]   it's like that Nine Inch Nails song,
[02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:20.140]   a copy of a copy of a copy.
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:21.540]   Yeah, it's just a copy of a copy.
[02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:25.060]   It's a Bitcoin gave Litecoin, Litecoin gave Dogecoin.
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:26.820]   And it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency.
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:28.540]   And I think Jackson was trying to do it
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:30.420]   to like prove a point about altcoins.
[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:33.540]   And then true to form, it's like nobody got the doctrine
[02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:35.500]   and completely perverted the entire religion.
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.900]   It's almost like the emperor of man in Warhammer 40K.
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:39.660]   It was like this atheist, don't worship me.
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:41.220]   And now there's like this whole religion
[02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:42.740]   built around the emperor.
[02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:44.940]   So Dogecoin has become a thing
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:46.680]   and it's become such a large thing
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:49.820]   that it is a reasonable target for somebody to fix it up
[02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:52.540]   and repair it, make it an interesting cryptocurrency.
[02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:54.420]   The point of the video was to show
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:56.500]   what a modern third generation cryptocurrency
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:43:57.820]   really would require.
[02:43:57.820 --> 02:43:58.980]   It's a major overhaul.
[02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:00.820]   And there are already people doing this.
[02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:03.340]   You know, there's the Solanas and the Harmony Ones
[02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:05.540]   and the Cardanos, Nioses and all these other guys.
[02:44:05.540 --> 02:44:08.300]   And they have billions of dollars and huge dev teams
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:09.980]   and all these innovative protocols.
[02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:12.740]   If you're really serious about this thing sticking around,
[02:44:12.740 --> 02:44:15.260]   being useful and doing stuff,
[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:16.780]   then the point of the video was to show
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:18.780]   the types of things you'd have to think about
[02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:21.340]   and the types of papers that are all open source,
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:23.660]   patent free and don't have any notion
[02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:25.100]   of intellectual property behind them
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:28.100]   that his engineers could grab and go and do.
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:30.500]   And he did mention on Twitter that he was looking
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:32.620]   for feedback on how to improve Doge.
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:33.740]   And so I said, all right, well,
[02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:35.460]   I'll just put all these things together.
[02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:36.620]   It was a little tongue in cheek
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:38.620]   'cause I figured he'd ignore it,
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:41.180]   but it was also showing how hard it is
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:42.820]   to innovate in this entire space.
[02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:44.340]   You know, you don't just go and say,
[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:47.220]   I'm gonna go build a battery powered car or rocket
[02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:48.460]   or enter a new industry.
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:49.940]   It's really hard to do that.
[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:52.180]   You spend years and lots of effort.
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:54.500]   You have to do series of small learning steps.
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:56.380]   You have to pick up destroyed rockets
[02:44:56.380 --> 02:44:58.180]   on the side of the beach and things like that
[02:44:58.180 --> 02:45:00.820]   before you get to the rocket landing itself.
[02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:02.580]   Well, analogously, it's really hard
[02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:03.880]   to build a cryptocurrency.
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:08.400]   Satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.380]   and that work was a derivative of 30 years of work
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:13.860]   in the digital assets space starting in the 1980s,
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:15.340]   working its way through.
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:18.460]   So, and then Bitcoin only did very limited things
[02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:20.060]   relative to what Ethereum can do
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:22.080]   or Cardano can do and so forth.
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:24.400]   So, the minute that you extend that complexity,
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:26.100]   you're talking about years of R&D,
[02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:28.620]   years of engineering effort that needs to be done.
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:30.100]   So, what's the point of Doge?
[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:32.140]   Is it just a meme?
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:34.460]   Is it actually contending to be useful
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:37.820]   or is it competing as a store of value against Bitcoin?
[02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:39.780]   Now, if it's competing as a store of value against Bitcoin,
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:42.700]   why the hell does it have the monetary policy it does?
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:45.660]   Also, there's predatory distribution of the underlying asset
[02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:47.980]   and over 90 some percent is consolidated
[02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:49.460]   in less than 1% of the holders.
[02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:50.700]   - For Dogecoin. - For Dogecoin
[02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:52.800]   at a very, very low price point.
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:55.000]   So, they can sell at almost any price point
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:56.320]   and make a profit.
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:59.120]   So, it hits 50 cents, they're billionaires
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:02.560]   and it's not like 20,000 people,
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:04.320]   it's probably less than 100 wallets
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:05.740]   that have that distribution.
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:07.800]   So, there's this existential ticking time bomb
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:10.440]   that's in Doge that once the guys who are vested
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:12.560]   start selling, they can just keep selling
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:14.280]   and keep selling and ride it all the way down
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:15.840]   and make windfall profits regardless
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:16.680]   of what price they sell at.
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:18.040]   And who are they selling against?
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:19.220]   The retail investors.
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:25.040]   People make $500 spare money a month or something like that.
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:27.540]   And it bothers me because I see it in my community.
[02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:31.160]   So, I live in Longmont, Colorado and I was at a restaurant
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:32.680]   and I was talking to the waitress
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:34.240]   and she asked me what business I was in.
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:35.740]   I said, "I'm in the cryptocurrency space."
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:36.760]   And she's like, "What is that?"
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:37.840]   And I started explaining all of it.
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:41.280]   And she goes, "Oh, yeah, I own some Dogecoin."
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:42.480]   I said, "You own anything else?"
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:43.720]   "No, no, I just bought some Doge."
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:44.620]   "Why did you buy Doge?"
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:46.880]   "Oh, I saw Elon tweeting about it
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.880]   "and I thought it was a good deal."
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:50.520]   So, when you see stuff like that
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:52.480]   where people have no clue what they're doing,
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:55.000]   they don't really understand the supply dynamics,
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.320]   the ownership dynamics and these types of things.
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:00.200]   And then when the clock stops,
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:01.980]   they're the ones who get hurt.
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:03.220]   And then the regulator comes in,
[02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:04.640]   the Elizabeth Warrens of the world,
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:06.480]   and they say, "See, this is an evidence
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:09.100]   "these guys can't regulate themselves, control themselves.
[02:47:09.100 --> 02:47:10.760]   "We need to control everything.
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:12.940]   "Either let's ban it or let's just announce
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:14.440]   "that the only three are legitimate
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:16.660]   "and every one of them has to be connected
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:18.720]   "to identity and rah, rah, rah."
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:22.160]   And I'm just very concerned that that's a bad thing to do.
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:24.840]   And that's why I've been so vocal about this topic.
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:27.680]   And my hope is that a compromise can be made
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:29.240]   where real developers come in
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:30.520]   and they start working on Doge
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:31.480]   and they find a way to create
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:33.400]   some sort of use and utility for it
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:37.240]   so at least it has a value floor and it won't collapse.
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:39.120]   - Is it possible for Cardano and Doge
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:40.720]   going to work together somehow?
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:42.720]   - Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun.
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:45.680]   I'm not adverse to the idea of cleaning up the code base,
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.960]   but legitimately whoever comes in,
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:50.520]   it'd be two years or three years of work.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:51.840]   'Cause you have to do real stuff
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.760]   and that code is like Litecoin circa 2012, 2013.
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:58.560]   - Well, the interesting thing about Elon,
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:00.400]   and I've got to interact with him quite a bit,
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.620]   that combination of humor and extreme ambition,
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:06.560]   like in the face of impossible odds,
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:08.400]   is something he does really well.
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:12.200]   And so I think that's the spirit of Dogecoin,
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:17.200]   is fun and almost like bold, ambitious,
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:20.640]   innovation and so I think you can't
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:22.240]   discount the power of that.
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:23.320]   - But where's the innovation?
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:24.280]   What's the agenda?
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:25.200]   - This is step one.
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.560]   - What's going to Mars for Dogecoin?
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:31.280]   - Well, I mean, he came in the same way to rockets,
[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:34.600]   he came in the same way to electric cars.
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:37.480]   It seemed impossible at first,
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:39.680]   but you step in and you solve the problems,
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:41.640]   first principles one at a time.
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:43.800]   - But I'll challenge you a little bit on this
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:45.440]   because I think he had some trends
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.200]   that he was very smart to recognize.
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:48.440]   In the case of battery-powered cars,
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:50.520]   he said, "Hang on, everybody has tablets and cell phones
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:53.100]   "and these other things and there's an incentive
[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:55.080]   "to make batteries better, faster, cheaper
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:56.200]   "and charge faster."
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:57.920]   And that's connected to mobile computing.
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:01.240]   So regardless if you want battery-powered cars or not,
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:03.760]   every year you have billions of dollars of R&D
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:07.440]   being pushed to force this capacity to evolve
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:08.800]   and he's just getting on the train
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:10.320]   and piggybacking on that.
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.920]   So that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize that.
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:15.520]   In the case of SpaceX, it was just an obvious question.
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:16.600]   If every time you get on a plane,
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:19.400]   you have to throw the plane away, no one would fly.
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:22.440]   So reusability is like a fundamental thing
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:25.280]   that if you solve that, you've now opened space up
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:27.920]   to a complete new class of commercialization.
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:29.960]   I don't see the problem in Dogecoin
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.200]   'cause if he was looking for it,
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.120]   then why not look at a real platform
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:35.320]   actually trying to solve a real problem?
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:37.280]   There's so many of them.
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:39.700]   He can throw a rock, he can hit 15 of these guys
[02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:42.160]   and they'd all die to work with Elon Musk.
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:43.200]   - Yeah, it's very interesting.
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.920]   I mean, so first, I could continue pushing back
[02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:49.160]   on your intuition about electric cars and batteries
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:49.980]   and so on.
[02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:52.000]   I don't think it's more obvious in retrospect
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.160]   than it is at the time, I would say.
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:57.520]   Because I would agree with you on the batteries front,
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.040]   I wouldn't necessarily agree with you with the electric car
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:01.880]   because first of all, nobody's started
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:04.240]   a successful car company for decades.
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:05.600]   - Well, but it was the loyalty.
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:08.480]   The EV4 guys or whatever it was with GM,
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:09.860]   they didn't wanna give 'em back
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:11.620]   when they hit the lease program.
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:13.520]   - So there's some basic intuition
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:14.920]   that there is some hunger here,
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:17.160]   but it's not obvious that you can do it successfully.
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:19.760]   And with relaunching rockets for cheap,
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:22.800]   that sounds good on paper, but to do it well,
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:25.320]   NASA is spending way more money for this.
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:29.520]   And the Russians were assholes not selling any rocket.
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:31.480]   Like you say, you have to do it all yourself from scratch.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:33.120]   How do you build the team?
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:38.040]   How do you launch rockets when if you fail a few times,
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:39.440]   you're gonna go bankrupt?
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:42.340]   I mean, just business-wise, I would rather build an app,
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:44.140]   like Angry Birds. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:45.300]   He's got-- - Launch rockets.
[02:50:45.300 --> 02:50:47.460]   - You gotta give him credit, he's got boulders for balls.
[02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:49.420]   (laughing)
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:52.220]   That's a good picture. - Yeah, thank you for that.
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:54.680]   But I don't, maybe that's what, I mean,
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:59.540]   I think there's not enough first principle thinking
[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:00.780]   on the cryptocurrency side.
[02:51:00.780 --> 02:51:02.540]   I think I agree with you on that.
[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:06.400]   But there's some aspect to which the seriousness
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:09.700]   of the cryptocurrency world is paralyzing.
[02:51:09.700 --> 02:51:14.420]   So in some way, the innovation that you spoke to
[02:51:14.420 --> 02:51:18.220]   requires taking risks, requires not taking everything
[02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:21.260]   so seriously, like being afraid to take those bold risks
[02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:24.140]   in the space of ideas, not in the space of financials.
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:29.140]   So in that way, I think that's one pro for Bitcoin
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:33.780]   is there's room, it's hungry for innovation.
[02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:35.260]   But I think Cardano in that same way
[02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:37.780]   is hungry for innovation, just like as you said,
[02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:41.740]   with some more rigor and formalism behind it.
[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:45.060]   And even Ethereum has a hunger for innovation.
[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:47.900]   That's where Bitcoin is a little bit more,
[02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:50.140]   I would say conservative in terms of how much innovating
[02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:53.100]   they're willing to do, in terms of the incentives
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.660]   they built into the systems for the evolution
[02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:57.220]   of the cryptocurrency.
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:52:00.800]   But yeah, I mean, it's difficult to psychoanalyze
[02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:04.820]   why Dogecoin is the thing that excites Elon so much.
[02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:09.220]   But at the same time, there's some power to the fun.
[02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:12.540]   It sounds ridiculous to say, but the fun,
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:17.540]   this idea that the most entertaining outcome
[02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:22.940]   is the most likely, there could be something built
[02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:25.800]   into the physics of the universe that makes that true.
[02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:30.800]   'Cause the viral nature of fun has power.
[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:35.980]   - Well, it's a neuroscience thing.
[02:52:35.980 --> 02:52:40.660]   We like dopamine, we like these chemicals in our brain.
[02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:43.340]   And when we have fun, we want more of it.
[02:52:43.340 --> 02:52:46.040]   So you tend to gravitate towards work activities
[02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:48.660]   and play activities that are enjoyable to you.
[02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:52.380]   And it is nice sometimes to kind of come in
[02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:54.060]   and troll an entire industry.
[02:52:54.060 --> 02:52:56.980]   I can imagine he's probably having the time of his life.
[02:52:56.980 --> 02:53:00.780]   It's the same as like taking Tesla private at 420.
[02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:01.820]   That kind of stuff.
[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:04.660]   And it's one thing when you do it with friends.
[02:53:04.660 --> 02:53:06.340]   It's another thing when you do it with the whole industry
[02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:09.060]   and it hurts people financially.
[02:53:09.060 --> 02:53:11.520]   And also I understand he hates short sellers
[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:12.940]   and there's some things there.
[02:53:12.940 --> 02:53:14.300]   And I can't speak for him
[02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:16.340]   because I only know the guy from a distance.
[02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:18.260]   It's just, I live in this space
[02:53:18.260 --> 02:53:19.780]   and I have to deal with the consequences
[02:53:19.780 --> 02:53:20.620]   and clean up the messes.
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:21.860]   - You feel the pain.
[02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:24.380]   - Yeah, and this results in a regulatory event.
[02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:26.220]   It's like, I'm the guy who has to put on a suit
[02:53:26.220 --> 02:53:28.820]   and go to Washington and go and sit in a Senate inquiry
[02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:29.660]   and all this stuff.
[02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:32.380]   I'm the guy that just like laugh with his friends
[02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:33.980]   about how he crashed the crypto market
[02:53:33.980 --> 02:53:36.100]   and how easy it was to do it.
[02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:39.300]   And that's my only umbrage about this.
[02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:41.220]   On the other hand, if it brings a lot of cool,
[02:53:41.220 --> 02:53:43.720]   new, interesting things and people into the space,
[02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:44.700]   that's a net positive.
[02:53:44.700 --> 02:53:47.580]   And so it's not universally bad or universally good.
[02:53:47.580 --> 02:53:50.380]   And I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt.
[02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:52.620]   And so I'm really hopeful to see
[02:53:52.620 --> 02:53:55.260]   what comes about this recent surge of interest
[02:53:55.260 --> 02:53:57.660]   and if Elon actually puts his money where his mouth is
[02:53:57.660 --> 02:54:00.780]   and takes some of his enormous engineering talent
[02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:03.380]   and capital and starts contributing
[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:05.940]   and building something in the cryptocurrency space.
[02:54:05.940 --> 02:54:07.640]   Be really cool to see that happen.
[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:11.220]   - There's a bunch of different technical aspects
[02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:13.380]   I want to ask you about on the Cardano side.
[02:54:13.380 --> 02:54:17.100]   So first, maybe on the scaling side, what is Hydra?
[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:20.440]   How does Hydra compare to other different ideas
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:22.660]   for scalability like roll-ups?
[02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:26.140]   Main trade-offs with respect to security, UX.
[02:54:27.140 --> 02:54:30.460]   Um, and anything else you want to talk about?
[02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:33.380]   - You have to have a little bit more energy, Lex, come on.
[02:54:33.380 --> 02:54:34.740]   - You know what I need?
[02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:36.580]   I need that Coke machine that you mentioned.
[02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:38.580]   The thing that converts water to cocaine.
[02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:40.540]   - Water to cocaine from Director Bullock?
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:43.180]   We'll leave this in, right?
[02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:44.260]   - Yeah.
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:45.660]   - Isomorphic state channels.
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:47.660]   That's a great topic, right?
[02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:51.060]   There's a word salad of cryptographic terms.
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:53.500]   Whether Lightning Hydra roll-ups, any of these things.
[02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:56.100]   Really what you're trying to do is say, okay,
[02:54:56.100 --> 02:54:58.900]   if I do it on layer one, it's slow and expensive.
[02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:02.100]   What I'm going to do is batch something, somehow, some way,
[02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:04.220]   and then do it in a different system
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:07.220]   where it's fast and cheap.
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:09.480]   And what I'm doing with that is I'm losing
[02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:12.620]   some of the security guarantees of the base layer
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:17.060]   and admitting a slight higher degree of centralization.
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:20.260]   But then I get super fast settlement,
[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:22.540]   I get super low-cost transactions,
[02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:24.620]   and potentially I may even be able
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:26.620]   to get distributed computing.
[02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:29.260]   Meaning that instead of having the smart contracts
[02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:30.420]   run in a replicated system,
[02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:32.880]   they can run on a single node, like a stake pool,
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:35.960]   and their stuff is different from the other guy's stuff.
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:40.600]   So you go from a system of capacity of whatever it is
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:44.160]   to a system of N for the totality of all the stake pools.
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.240]   So basically Hydra is just the next generation of that
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:49.880]   when you have the ability to tinker
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:52.980]   with the accounting model and the layer two solution
[02:55:52.980 --> 02:55:55.660]   is co-designed with the layer one solution.
[02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:57.780]   So it's like what Lightning would have been
[02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:00.820]   had Lightning been co-developed when Bitcoin came out.
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:03.460]   There would have been special provisions made in Bitcoin
[02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:05.500]   specifically to accommodate Lightning,
[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:07.220]   and it would have made it very easy for you then
[02:56:07.220 --> 02:56:09.460]   to move inside the system, outside of the system,
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:12.100]   and have security properties preserved,
[02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:15.380]   like availability, for example, or fraud resistance.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:16.980]   They always, you can't steal the money,
[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:18.260]   or these types of things.
[02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:19.760]   Where things get really complex,
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:22.420]   and this is why Hydra's novel over Lightning,
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:24.060]   is when you want to move beyond payments
[02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:25.620]   to state management.
[02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:26.900]   Okay, so payments are just,
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:29.460]   I want to move between Alice to Bob as quickly as possible,
[02:56:29.460 --> 02:56:31.060]   as low cost as possible.
[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:34.260]   So for example, I have a micro tipping application,
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:37.160]   like change tip on Twitter, or like a video,
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.180]   I'm watching YouTube video,
[02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:39.720]   like maybe this video in the future,
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:41.340]   and people really like it, and they click tip,
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:43.460]   and you get five cents or something like that.
[02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:46.580]   Okay, so that's an example of a perfect payment application,
[02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:48.640]   and that's great, but what happens
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:50.500]   when you actually have a rich smart contract,
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:53.420]   like a DEX, or you want to do a video game,
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:55.620]   or something like that, you want to run that off chain,
[02:56:55.620 --> 02:56:59.060]   but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens.
[02:56:59.060 --> 02:57:01.820]   So a state channel basically lets you do that,
[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:04.020]   but it's a lot more complicated,
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:05.700]   and there's a lot more to think about.
[02:57:05.700 --> 02:57:09.040]   So Hydra basically just has in its design,
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:11.300]   a collection of ideas of how to do that,
[02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:15.180]   and the current paper is for a single head.
[02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:17.340]   The next thing you do is composition.
[02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:18.900]   So you go multiple heads,
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:20.900]   and there's a routing protocol between them,
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:22.620]   and then eventually create these tail protocols
[02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:24.260]   for when things get asynchronous.
[02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:25.820]   So instead of always being aligned,
[02:57:25.820 --> 02:57:26.860]   and always being available,
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:28.780]   what happens if they die for a bit,
[02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:29.980]   and then they come back?
[02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:31.900]   And you can create all kinds of guarantees
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:34.520]   that your funds won't be lost, or locked forever,
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:35.360]   or things like that.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:37.740]   There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff.
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:39.580]   And basically the idea is,
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:42.260]   leverage what Lightning has already achieved with Bitcoin,
[02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:44.720]   but then take advantage of the fact
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:46.940]   that you have a more expressive accounting model,
[02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:48.740]   and a more expressive programming model,
[02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:50.180]   so you can just physically do more,
[02:57:50.180 --> 02:57:52.260]   and you can put more crypto inside that thing.
[02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:53.660]   Now contrast it with rollups,
[02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:55.260]   really that is just saying,
[02:57:55.260 --> 02:57:56.660]   you're gonna take some thing,
[02:57:56.660 --> 02:57:58.400]   batch a bunch of transactions together,
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:00.040]   and you're gonna generate a proof,
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:01.480]   and then what you can do is,
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:03.400]   whenever you see some part of that history,
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:05.860]   you can check it against that proof that's rolled up.
[02:58:05.860 --> 02:58:08.680]   And there's closely related concept of recursive snarks,
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:09.520]   that you'll see a lot.
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.660]   There's things like the Mina protocol, or other things.
[02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:14.580]   And basically the idea is that whenever you see something,
[02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:16.860]   you can always generate two proofs,
[02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:19.380]   an existential proof that the coins exist,
[02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:21.820]   and a non-existence of a double spend.
[02:58:21.820 --> 02:58:23.540]   So you can always check those two properties.
[02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:26.980]   And the proof is verifiable in logarithmic time, ideally.
[02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:29.300]   So you can have giant amounts of data,
[02:58:29.300 --> 02:58:32.300]   but it's very small, the actual proof is concise.
[02:58:32.300 --> 02:58:35.660]   Okay, so they're just different boats for different floats.
[02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:38.580]   The advantage of a layer two network,
[02:58:38.580 --> 02:58:39.900]   where there's actual channels,
[02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:42.520]   and there's interaction, and there's service providers,
[02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:44.380]   is the channels can eventually scale
[02:58:44.380 --> 02:58:46.620]   in the collection of things that they can do,
[02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:49.660]   and eventually they can become interoperability networks
[02:58:49.660 --> 02:58:51.360]   between cryptocurrencies.
[02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:53.940]   So at some point, we could modify the Bolt spec,
[02:58:53.940 --> 02:58:56.340]   and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra.
[02:58:56.340 --> 02:58:57.360]   And then what you could happen is,
[02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:58.540]   you could use it as a bridge,
[02:58:58.540 --> 02:59:00.100]   to actually do cross-chain traffic,
[02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:02.460]   and send transactions between the systems.
[02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:03.900]   You don't really think about that too much,
[02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:04.940]   when you're talking about roll-ups.
[02:59:04.940 --> 02:59:07.500]   That's more of optimizing what you have within the system.
[02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:08.340]   - Within the chain.
[02:59:08.340 --> 02:59:10.660]   So can you elaborate how it's possible
[02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:12.860]   to do cross-chain traffic?
[02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:14.140]   - Well, you already have the intermediary,
[02:59:14.140 --> 02:59:15.540]   you have the channel operator,
[02:59:15.540 --> 02:59:18.740]   and you already have Lightning protocol, right?
[02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:21.700]   And you just build a DEX that runs within that system,
[02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:24.300]   and they can swap assets, or you can do wrapped assets.
[02:59:24.300 --> 02:59:25.140]   So you lock it.
[02:59:25.140 --> 02:59:26.220]   - So it would be like low cost?
[02:59:26.220 --> 02:59:28.060]   I guess you could just switch low.
[02:59:28.060 --> 02:59:30.060]   - Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one,
[02:59:30.060 --> 02:59:31.020]   will let you batch the other.
[02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:32.420]   So if Lightning works on Bitcoin,
[02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:34.080]   and Hydra works on Cardano,
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:35.840]   you can eventually bridge these two together,
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.740]   and create a way of moving back and forth.
[02:59:37.740 --> 02:59:39.380]   And the same things that make transactions
[02:59:39.380 --> 02:59:40.580]   in and out of that network cheap,
[02:59:40.580 --> 02:59:43.220]   will make creating wrapped assets cheap.
[02:59:43.220 --> 02:59:45.580]   At least on the Bitcoin to Cardano side,
[02:59:45.580 --> 02:59:47.460]   you can't create assets on Bitcoin.
[02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:49.900]   Another flaw of Bitcoin that they've never fixed.
[02:59:49.900 --> 02:59:52.580]   - What's your thought about Layer 2 technologies in general?
[02:59:52.580 --> 02:59:53.940]   Is there stuff you're excited about?
[02:59:53.940 --> 02:59:55.820]   We talked quite a bit about Lightning Network,
[02:59:55.820 --> 02:59:57.940]   Hydra, these ideas.
[02:59:57.940 --> 02:59:59.860]   Do you think there'll be somebody that wins out,
[02:59:59.860 --> 03:00:01.780]   or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing
[03:00:01.780 --> 03:00:03.820]   that we just keep building different ideas,
[03:00:03.820 --> 03:00:05.540]   and they all interact with each other?
[03:00:05.540 --> 03:00:08.460]   - It goes back to biology, that cell differentiation concept.
[03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:11.500]   You have to build specialized tissue to do these things.
[03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:13.540]   Point of Layer 2 is to extend the network.
[03:00:13.540 --> 03:00:15.320]   It's adding a foot, it's adding an arm,
[03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:18.220]   it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart, it's adding eyes.
[03:00:18.220 --> 03:00:20.380]   Giving you additional senses, you have ears now.
[03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:21.940]   So when you add these Layer 2 protocols,
[03:00:21.940 --> 03:00:24.000]   like a Tala Prism is a perfect example of that.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:27.260]   We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardano.
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:29.500]   It's a real bad deal to do that.
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:31.740]   'Cause China will come in, or US will come in,
[03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:32.860]   and tell you how to do that.
[03:00:32.860 --> 03:00:34.380]   What you do is you build a Layer 2 protocol
[03:00:34.380 --> 03:00:35.700]   that's blockchain agnostic,
[03:00:35.700 --> 03:00:37.420]   and then the user can decide
[03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:38.860]   when and where they need an identity,
[03:00:38.860 --> 03:00:41.220]   and then bring that identity into the system.
[03:00:41.220 --> 03:00:43.340]   And if you designed it right, when they bring it in,
[03:00:43.340 --> 03:00:45.380]   it's very easy, very fluid,
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:47.820]   and suddenly the experience enhances.
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:49.300]   Everything just gets better.
[03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:51.780]   Oh wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things.
[03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:53.860]   They go from gray to green in the App Store.
[03:00:53.860 --> 03:00:55.020]   That's so cool.
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:58.420]   Or oh wow, now I can send to human readable addresses.
[03:00:58.420 --> 03:01:00.220]   'Cause if I have an identity and you have an identity,
[03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:02.420]   we can alias them with some namespace,
[03:01:02.420 --> 03:01:03.620]   and now I send to Lex,
[03:01:03.620 --> 03:01:08.100]   instead of some horrible back 32 address structure.
[03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:10.940]   Okay, so that's really what you need to do with Layer 2,
[03:01:10.940 --> 03:01:13.140]   is say, okay, each Layer 2 protocol
[03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:14.180]   is meant to do something.
[03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:15.540]   Either it gives me payments,
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:17.300]   or lower cost of our contracts,
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:19.780]   or interoperability, or identity.
[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:21.540]   And then it's a marketplace.
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:23.660]   So you should have blockchain agnosticism
[03:01:23.660 --> 03:01:25.020]   with your Layer 2 solutions.
[03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:27.020]   And so you can mix and match,
[03:01:27.020 --> 03:01:29.260]   and choose whichever collection of services you need.
[03:01:29.260 --> 03:01:31.540]   And that's actually how IT works these days,
[03:01:31.540 --> 03:01:33.660]   with microservices and these other things,
[03:01:33.660 --> 03:01:35.460]   and cloud software.
[03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:38.540]   Every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers,
[03:01:38.540 --> 03:01:40.660]   and basically that composition of them
[03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:41.860]   is your software stack.
[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:45.860]   - Jumping around, back to proof of work.
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:49.180]   What are non-interactive proofs of proof of work?
[03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:51.700]   N-I-P-O-P-O-W-S.
[03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:52.900]   - Nip-pah-pows.
[03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:53.740]   - Nip-pah-pows.
[03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:54.860]   - Nip-pah-pows, it's fun to say, right?
[03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:55.700]   - Nip-pah-pows.
[03:01:55.700 --> 03:01:57.180]   - It's just one of those things that you notice
[03:01:57.180 --> 03:01:58.980]   that certain proofs of work,
[03:01:58.980 --> 03:02:00.180]   when you solve them,
[03:02:00.180 --> 03:02:02.100]   come up less frequently than other ones.
[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:04.180]   And just by that nature,
[03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:05.460]   you can sample them,
[03:02:05.460 --> 03:02:07.060]   and then construct proofs from them.
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:09.940]   So you can, with that just set,
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:12.020]   have a more concise representation
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:14.100]   of an amount of work for a range of the chain.
[03:02:14.100 --> 03:02:14.940]   So that works--
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:15.780]   - Can you say that again?
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:16.620]   - Yeah, I was gonna say,
[03:02:16.620 --> 03:02:17.620]   that works salad.
[03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:19.180]   Basically, the idea is, okay,
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:20.980]   so let's say that this block,
[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:22.740]   and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot.
[03:02:22.740 --> 03:02:27.180]   This block, you get a regular green type of proof of work,
[03:02:27.180 --> 03:02:28.740]   and then this block, you get a green,
[03:02:28.740 --> 03:02:29.620]   and you keep going,
[03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:31.540]   and then suddenly you get a red one.
[03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:33.000]   So it's still a valid proof of work,
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.820]   but it's more rare than the other ones.
[03:02:35.820 --> 03:02:37.620]   So if you notice that particular pattern,
[03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:39.260]   what you can do is you can just start
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:41.380]   not caring so much about the green ones,
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:44.460]   and you can just bookend your chain with red.
[03:02:44.460 --> 03:02:46.460]   Okay, and then you can just repeat that,
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:47.300]   and repeat that, repeat that,
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:50.820]   and you can create this really compressed representation
[03:02:50.820 --> 03:02:51.740]   of these things.
[03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:52.580]   So what does it mean?
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:55.000]   It means that suddenly, when you have that,
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:56.460]   now you have a way of representing
[03:02:56.460 --> 03:03:00.380]   a long range of history with a very small proof.
[03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:01.940]   So you can use it for light wallets,
[03:03:01.940 --> 03:03:05.340]   and you also can use it for sidechains,
[03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:07.780]   if both sidechains use proof of work.
[03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:09.380]   So when you see a transaction come in,
[03:03:09.380 --> 03:03:11.180]   you don't have a copy of the sidechain,
[03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.740]   but you have a copy of the proof of work,
[03:03:12.740 --> 03:03:14.980]   and it has the same algorithmic weight
[03:03:14.980 --> 03:03:17.500]   as the normal longest chain,
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:19.000]   because you don't have all the greens,
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.940]   but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency.
[03:03:21.940 --> 03:03:25.300]   So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zindros and Agalos,
[03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:27.060]   and it's just an amazing paper,
[03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:28.660]   and what's so cool about it
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:30.860]   is it doesn't require any structural changes
[03:03:30.860 --> 03:03:31.700]   to proof of work.
[03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:32.700]   It's just something you notice
[03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:34.420]   as an off-gas of proof of work.
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:36.500]   It's like you're watching an engine operate,
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:38.540]   and you notice like every 500 times
[03:03:38.540 --> 03:03:41.020]   a piston will do a certain weird thing,
[03:03:41.020 --> 03:03:42.420]   and so you take advantage of that.
[03:03:42.420 --> 03:03:44.220]   You say, well, if I count 10 of them,
[03:03:44.220 --> 03:03:47.220]   now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes,
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:48.660]   as I observe that pattern.
[03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:50.420]   And so it's the same concept there,
[03:03:50.420 --> 03:03:52.580]   and it's just a property of the engine.
[03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:54.080]   So you don't really need to hard fork it in.
[03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:54.920]   It's just there,
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:57.060]   and because you can build proofs that way,
[03:03:57.060 --> 03:03:59.700]   now you can use those proofs to do like clients,
[03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:01.140]   and you can use those proofs to do other things,
[03:04:01.140 --> 03:04:01.980]   'cause you just use that
[03:04:01.980 --> 03:04:03.460]   as something that comes with the history.
[03:04:03.460 --> 03:04:04.900]   You don't have to have the whole blockchain.
[03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:06.100]   - Now, is this a weird property
[03:04:06.100 --> 03:04:08.560]   of multiple proof of work chains?
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:12.060]   - It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm,
[03:04:12.060 --> 03:04:15.340]   but usually there's some portability in this type of thing.
[03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:16.460]   Like we're right now exploring,
[03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:18.020]   can you do NEPA piles with Prism
[03:04:18.020 --> 03:04:20.180]   or any of these sharded proof of work protocols,
[03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:21.420]   but it looks like you can.
[03:04:21.420 --> 03:04:23.580]   The closely related is log space mining.
[03:04:23.580 --> 03:04:25.340]   So you can use this concept,
[03:04:25.340 --> 03:04:26.900]   and instead of having the entire blockchain
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:27.880]   to be able to mine,
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:29.980]   you can use a compressed representation of it.
[03:04:29.980 --> 03:04:31.740]   We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining
[03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:33.720]   that basically explains how to do that.
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:38.180]   So your miner only has this very small micro ledger
[03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:40.460]   as opposed to the entire ledger.
[03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:43.060]   - How does it connect back to the entire ledger?
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:43.900]   How does the--
[03:04:43.900 --> 03:04:45.620]   - Because you have those red blocks,
[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:46.740]   you have those special things,
[03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:48.780]   and so you know that the state you're working on
[03:04:48.780 --> 03:04:50.820]   is actually legitimate, right?
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:52.900]   - Oh, so the map goes both ways?
[03:04:52.900 --> 03:04:55.500]   - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:56.420]   - Wow, that's really interesting.
[03:04:56.420 --> 03:04:58.580]   - Yeah, and Dines is a genius.
[03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:00.020]   He's a really, really smart kid,
[03:05:00.020 --> 03:05:01.740]   and he got his PhD under us.
[03:05:01.740 --> 03:05:03.280]   He went to University of Athens,
[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:05.300]   and he was a Agalos's graduate student,
[03:05:05.300 --> 03:05:08.380]   and now he's doing a postdoc at Stanford under David Shih,
[03:05:08.380 --> 03:05:10.340]   and this is literally the only thing he does.
[03:05:10.340 --> 03:05:13.100]   He does interoperability, sidechain stuff,
[03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:14.580]   Nipah Pals and so forth,
[03:05:14.580 --> 03:05:16.580]   and he's written a lot of great papers on it,
[03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:18.740]   and that was a testimony to hard work
[03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:20.060]   for getting the paper published
[03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:21.820]   because the paper came out in 2016,
[03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:23.600]   but I think it took three or four years
[03:05:23.600 --> 03:05:25.500]   for it to go through peer review.
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:28.300]   He kept trying to push it one conference after rejection,
[03:05:28.300 --> 03:05:29.380]   after another rejection,
[03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:30.860]   but he got it through.
[03:05:30.860 --> 03:05:32.180]   Real proud of that kid,
[03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:33.540]   and then he's just doing all this beautiful
[03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:37.000]   derivative work now, like log space mining and so forth.
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.200]   - So, Reddit.
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:42.220]   Any sentence that starts with Reddit,
[03:05:42.220 --> 03:05:43.600]   you know it's gonna be fun.
[03:05:43.600 --> 03:05:47.560]   The top question on the Cardano subreddit,
[03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:50.480]   which is quite a wonderful place, by the way,
[03:05:50.480 --> 03:05:55.200]   was can you get Charles to play devil's advocate
[03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:56.960]   against Cardano?
[03:05:56.960 --> 03:06:00.040]   If it's going to fail, what would failure look like,
[03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:02.640]   and what are the most likely reasons it would fail?
[03:06:02.640 --> 03:06:06.560]   - Okay, well there's the failure,
[03:06:06.560 --> 03:06:09.040]   for example, I said one of the project goals
[03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:11.160]   was to achieve self-evolution.
[03:06:11.160 --> 03:06:12.560]   So, if it doesn't achieve that,
[03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:16.040]   where it can evolve itself iteration by iteration,
[03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:19.160]   then obviously the product didn't do what was intended.
[03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:23.000]   If it continuously required the supervision of custodians
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:26.700]   in order for it to succeed, the system just won't work.
[03:06:26.700 --> 03:06:29.320]   The good news is we have a lot of data showing the opposite.
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:31.680]   You know, we used to run a federated model,
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:33.200]   and now we're completely decentralized
[03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:34.420]   for block production,
[03:06:34.420 --> 03:06:36.360]   but that didn't just happen overnight.
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:38.400]   I mean, there was a whole process
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:39.960]   with the incentivized test net,
[03:06:39.960 --> 03:06:41.800]   and the stake pool pioneers program,
[03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:42.920]   and the launch of Shelly,
[03:06:42.920 --> 03:06:45.720]   and the decrementing of the decentralization parameter,
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:47.160]   and every step of the way, people showed up
[03:06:47.160 --> 03:06:48.320]   and had to do things,
[03:06:48.320 --> 03:06:51.560]   and we went from several to thousands of people
[03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:54.040]   who were regularly maintaining the infrastructure.
[03:06:54.040 --> 03:06:57.060]   But there's no guarantee that that would be sustainable,
[03:06:57.060 --> 03:06:59.860]   and there's no guarantee that the next step,
[03:06:59.860 --> 03:07:02.100]   the smart contract step, will achieve what we want,
[03:07:02.100 --> 03:07:03.460]   and the next step, the governance step,
[03:07:03.460 --> 03:07:04.740]   will achieve what we want.
[03:07:04.740 --> 03:07:06.820]   I mean, it's an experiment in all these types of things.
[03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:09.260]   All cryptocurrencies, all companies,
[03:07:09.260 --> 03:07:10.740]   are, in a sense, experiments
[03:07:10.740 --> 03:07:12.900]   when they are evolving the business model.
[03:07:12.900 --> 03:07:17.560]   And as our case, our business is systems and society.
[03:07:17.560 --> 03:07:19.620]   We're offering to the world a vision
[03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:22.220]   of how to run humanity in a different way,
[03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:24.220]   and the only way the system can do that
[03:07:24.220 --> 03:07:26.580]   is by millions of people joining the system,
[03:07:26.580 --> 03:07:27.900]   self-evolving the system,
[03:07:27.900 --> 03:07:30.580]   and growing it in that particular direction.
[03:07:30.580 --> 03:07:32.380]   Another failure scenario would be
[03:07:32.380 --> 03:07:34.900]   the system evolves in the wrong direction.
[03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:36.140]   So it's self-evolving,
[03:07:36.140 --> 03:07:39.620]   but it goes into a more centralized dystopian way,
[03:07:39.620 --> 03:07:41.380]   and that's problematic as well.
[03:07:41.380 --> 03:07:42.220]   - What would that look like?
[03:07:42.220 --> 03:07:44.060]   What would dystopia,
[03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:46.300]   self-evolution toward dystopia look like?
[03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:48.580]   - A small group of actors have total control
[03:07:48.580 --> 03:07:50.100]   over who gets to use the system
[03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:51.540]   and how they get to use the system,
[03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:53.700]   and your use of the system is monitored
[03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:56.180]   and shared with that small group of actors.
[03:07:56.180 --> 03:07:58.980]   So social credit in China is a great example of that.
[03:07:58.980 --> 03:08:00.860]   A small group of people have access to that,
[03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:03.540]   and then your experience in Chinese society
[03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:04.640]   is determined by it.
[03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:07.740]   So that's an example of a failure mode.
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:10.700]   And then another could be just network effect.
[03:08:10.700 --> 03:08:13.220]   We start experiencing a churn rate,
[03:08:13.220 --> 03:08:16.860]   and inputs don't match the outputs
[03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:19.540]   in that you lose more than you gain,
[03:08:19.540 --> 03:08:21.780]   and then over time, the system dies off.
[03:08:21.780 --> 03:08:23.540]   However, that's really hard in practice.
[03:08:23.540 --> 03:08:25.420]   Once you reach a certain network effect,
[03:08:25.420 --> 03:08:27.980]   even if you become stagnant and stale,
[03:08:27.980 --> 03:08:29.540]   you tend not to lose your users.
[03:08:29.540 --> 03:08:32.340]   And our evangelism is unbelievable
[03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:33.380]   in the Cardano community.
[03:08:33.380 --> 03:08:35.900]   I think we're number one for tattoos.
[03:08:35.900 --> 03:08:37.260]   And if you think about that,
[03:08:37.260 --> 03:08:38.860]   it's a strange metric to have,
[03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:41.100]   but there are brands that associate that way.
[03:08:41.100 --> 03:08:43.140]   Apple and Harley-Davidson and so forth,
[03:08:43.140 --> 03:08:45.340]   people tend to actually tattoo the logo.
[03:08:45.340 --> 03:08:47.060]   Those people don't leave.
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:49.460]   They don't actually walk away from the ecosystem.
[03:08:49.460 --> 03:08:51.300]   They're fanboys to the core.
[03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:55.240]   So there's a lot of people that are here for life.
[03:08:55.240 --> 03:08:58.020]   They don't care if it's dollar ADA, two cent ADA.
[03:08:58.020 --> 03:08:59.860]   They believe in the mission, vision, and value
[03:08:59.860 --> 03:09:01.180]   of what we wish to achieve,
[03:09:01.180 --> 03:09:03.300]   and they've become evangelists in that respect.
[03:09:03.300 --> 03:09:06.800]   So the question is, does that community sustain itself?
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:09.100]   And also, does that community not make the same sins
[03:09:09.100 --> 03:09:10.580]   and mistake of Bitcoin,
[03:09:10.580 --> 03:09:12.940]   where they become toxic and maximalistic,
[03:09:12.940 --> 03:09:14.660]   and they start becoming highly religious
[03:09:14.660 --> 03:09:16.220]   about whatever beliefs they have?
[03:09:16.220 --> 03:09:20.180]   My hope is our community will be open and Socratic
[03:09:20.180 --> 03:09:21.900]   and love the scientific method
[03:09:21.900 --> 03:09:24.180]   and be willing to entertain ideas
[03:09:24.180 --> 03:09:26.580]   without adopting them and discard ideas
[03:09:26.580 --> 03:09:28.060]   that are proven to be wrong.
[03:09:28.060 --> 03:09:31.380]   If we become dogmatic and embrace an orthodoxy
[03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:33.700]   that is counterproductive to innovation,
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:36.120]   then it'll stall out the ecosystem.
[03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:38.540]   And you'll notice I never said price in any of this.
[03:09:38.540 --> 03:09:42.580]   I never said, hey, failure is if the price goes way down,
[03:09:42.580 --> 03:09:44.900]   and success is if the price goes way up.
[03:09:44.900 --> 03:09:46.940]   That's unfortunately the metric that most people use,
[03:09:46.940 --> 03:09:48.620]   but I couldn't care less about it.
[03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:51.340]   Because the reality is, if you construct a system
[03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:53.540]   that encompasses the entire globe
[03:09:53.540 --> 03:09:55.100]   and has billions of users,
[03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:57.100]   it's probably gonna be a pretty valuable system.
[03:09:57.100 --> 03:09:59.420]   That's a secondary thing.
[03:09:59.420 --> 03:10:02.100]   It's an after effect of having success
[03:10:02.100 --> 03:10:03.680]   in adoption, use, and utility.
[03:10:03.680 --> 03:10:06.980]   Unfortunately, most people on Reddit
[03:10:06.980 --> 03:10:08.860]   and Twitter and other channels,
[03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:11.540]   they tend to just judge your entire success based on that.
[03:10:11.540 --> 03:10:13.900]   I had very few people, when Shelley launched,
[03:10:13.900 --> 03:10:15.580]   even though it took us four years to get there,
[03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:18.460]   a lot of work, say congratulations on Shelley.
[03:10:18.460 --> 03:10:20.660]   But I had a lot of people, when ADA reached the dollar,
[03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:22.860]   say, we're so proud of you, amazing work.
[03:10:22.860 --> 03:10:24.380]   Congratulations, and so forth.
[03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:26.300]   And that's probably the most disheartening thing
[03:10:26.300 --> 03:10:30.420]   about the whole being around and doing this stuff,
[03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:32.660]   where all the things you do only matter
[03:10:32.660 --> 03:10:34.620]   as long as it's making someone else rich.
[03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:37.320]   And in a way, I feel almost like a failure.
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:42.460]   That mindset means that we haven't yet
[03:10:42.460 --> 03:10:44.880]   inculcated the community in a proper way,
[03:10:44.880 --> 03:10:48.260]   saying, hey guys, this is about more than money.
[03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:49.860]   It's about more than the value of ADA.
[03:10:49.860 --> 03:10:51.180]   What we're attempting to do here
[03:10:51.180 --> 03:10:52.980]   is re-engineer the way society works.
[03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:54.620]   I'd like your voting to be different.
[03:10:54.620 --> 03:10:55.860]   I'd like your property to be different.
[03:10:55.860 --> 03:10:58.860]   I'd like you on your cell phone to have a universal wallet.
[03:10:58.860 --> 03:11:00.540]   And when you go to Starbucks or wherever,
[03:11:00.540 --> 03:11:03.460]   you can buy your coffee with silver or gold
[03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:05.420]   or airline miles or something like that,
[03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:07.220]   and they get paid whenever the hell they wanna get paid.
[03:11:07.220 --> 03:11:09.060]   And I want those rails to be done with a system
[03:11:09.060 --> 03:11:11.260]   that puts you in charge, not someone else.
[03:11:11.260 --> 03:11:12.720]   And they say, yeah, that's all fine and great,
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:15.760]   as long as ADA's $5, we're all happy.
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:18.040]   You see, so that's a problem.
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:19.700]   There are, of course, other things that could fail.
[03:11:19.700 --> 03:11:22.060]   Like we could lose project cohesion,
[03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:23.780]   lots of people could quit and die.
[03:11:23.780 --> 03:11:25.380]   But again, there's so much momentum,
[03:11:25.380 --> 03:11:26.380]   there's so many things here,
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:27.940]   the ideas are already out there,
[03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:29.980]   and there's no intellectual property.
[03:11:29.980 --> 03:11:31.180]   When you publish 100 papers,
[03:11:31.180 --> 03:11:32.580]   you write a million lines of code,
[03:11:32.580 --> 03:11:34.420]   that's something, and it's permanent.
[03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:35.900]   And it's in the commons now,
[03:11:35.900 --> 03:11:38.380]   so it's just as much yours as it is mine.
[03:11:38.380 --> 03:11:41.180]   So there's no notion that somehow,
[03:11:41.180 --> 03:11:43.280]   if the core development company disappeared,
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:46.860]   then that concept is lost forever,
[03:11:46.860 --> 03:11:50.180]   like the library of Alexandria burning to the ground.
[03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:53.020]   It's there, and someone else will take it,
[03:11:53.020 --> 03:11:55.380]   fork it, and get it done.
[03:11:55.380 --> 03:11:56.740]   - I mean, first of all, that's fascinating.
[03:11:56.740 --> 03:11:59.020]   The self-evolution, you don't know which trajectories
[03:11:59.020 --> 03:11:59.860]   that's gonna take.
[03:11:59.860 --> 03:12:03.620]   But also, there could be singular events,
[03:12:03.620 --> 03:12:07.860]   like bugs in the system create an opportunity
[03:12:07.860 --> 03:12:09.380]   to hack the system.
[03:12:09.380 --> 03:12:12.860]   Is that something that you see as a potential failure case?
[03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:14.540]   - Yeah, it's always a possibility.
[03:12:14.540 --> 03:12:15.540]   Bugs can exist.
[03:12:15.540 --> 03:12:17.940]   There can be flaws in the protocol design.
[03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:19.500]   Zcash was a great example of that,
[03:12:19.500 --> 03:12:21.020]   where there was a subtle flaw,
[03:12:21.020 --> 03:12:23.300]   and it damaged the fidelity of the cryptocurrency
[03:12:23.300 --> 03:12:26.100]   in ways no other cryptocurrency's ever experienced.
[03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:27.980]   Normally, when you have a bug,
[03:12:27.980 --> 03:12:30.300]   the bug, you can see it, like the Bitcoin overflow,
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:31.380]   the value overflow incident.
[03:12:31.380 --> 03:12:32.580]   Yes, Bitcoin can be created,
[03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:34.500]   but we can verify they weren't.
[03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:36.420]   So the monetary policy is preserved.
[03:12:36.420 --> 03:12:39.260]   When you have a bug with a private system, like Zcash,
[03:12:39.260 --> 03:12:41.460]   and it exists on the shielded side,
[03:12:41.460 --> 03:12:43.580]   there's no guarantee, unless you can audit
[03:12:43.580 --> 03:12:45.780]   the total supply inside that shielded side.
[03:12:45.780 --> 03:12:47.340]   My understanding is you can't,
[03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:49.140]   that somebody didn't exploit the bug
[03:12:49.140 --> 03:12:51.180]   and create trillions of these coins out of thin air,
[03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:53.820]   just hiding them on that system and dripping them out.
[03:12:53.820 --> 03:12:55.980]   And so the monetary policy's forever damaged
[03:12:55.980 --> 03:12:57.540]   as a consequence of a bug like that.
[03:12:57.540 --> 03:12:59.420]   It's probably the worst type of bug you can have
[03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:01.100]   for these types of products.
[03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:03.980]   So, no matter how good of a job you do,
[03:13:03.980 --> 03:13:05.180]   they have great scientists,
[03:13:05.180 --> 03:13:07.440]   there are great people there, great engineers there.
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:09.800]   You can always have something like that seep its way in,
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:12.780]   leak its way in, and that lurks in the distance.
[03:13:12.780 --> 03:13:15.500]   But if that's a problem shared
[03:13:15.500 --> 03:13:17.220]   with every one of your neighbors,
[03:13:17.220 --> 03:13:20.460]   it's like everybody working at a nuclear power plant.
[03:13:20.460 --> 03:13:22.460]   Well, yeah, you can all die of radiation poisoning.
[03:13:22.460 --> 03:13:24.620]   Well, we all kind of knew that, didn't we?
[03:13:24.620 --> 03:13:27.820]   You know, so it's like I don't really think
[03:13:27.820 --> 03:13:28.660]   too much about it.
[03:13:28.660 --> 03:13:30.620]   I think the context of the question was more,
[03:13:30.620 --> 03:13:33.460]   what is Cardano-specific over Ethereum or Bitcoin
[03:13:33.460 --> 03:13:34.540]   or any of these other things?
[03:13:34.540 --> 03:13:37.580]   And yeah, okay, an existential lurking bug could happen.
[03:13:37.580 --> 03:13:40.160]   It's lower probability for us than the other systems
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:41.980]   because we use formal methods
[03:13:41.980 --> 03:13:45.880]   and we use peer review inside the protocol design.
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:48.180]   So, there's been more eyeballs and tools and techniques
[03:13:48.180 --> 03:13:49.220]   used to check things.
[03:13:49.220 --> 03:13:52.380]   And we actually have discovered a lot of weird wonky bugs
[03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:54.920]   before production and resolved those bugs.
[03:13:54.920 --> 03:13:56.660]   So, it shows you the system works.
[03:13:56.660 --> 03:13:57.780]   It's a lot of fun.
[03:13:57.780 --> 03:14:00.580]   - What about close kind of competitors?
[03:14:00.580 --> 03:14:01.860]   I don't know if you would put it that way,
[03:14:01.860 --> 03:14:04.000]   but if you look in the space of ideas,
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:08.420]   competitor cryptocurrencies like Polkadot,
[03:14:08.420 --> 03:14:09.860]   what are some interesting differences
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:12.140]   between Cardano and Polkadot,
[03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:14.380]   technically, philosophically, historically?
[03:14:14.380 --> 03:14:15.620]   Is that something you think about
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:17.580]   when you think about the future of Cardano?
[03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:19.300]   - Yeah, I mean, we do.
[03:14:19.300 --> 03:14:20.740]   We actually have a whole group of people
[03:14:20.740 --> 03:14:23.340]   that do business intelligence and comparative analysis.
[03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:25.540]   And we're getting to a point where we wanna start
[03:14:25.540 --> 03:14:27.220]   eventually forking their code
[03:14:27.220 --> 03:14:28.580]   and running private versions of it
[03:14:28.580 --> 03:14:29.700]   and just playing around with things.
[03:14:29.700 --> 03:14:30.540]   - Well, that's fascinating.
[03:14:30.540 --> 03:14:31.380]   - Getting better at it.
[03:14:31.380 --> 03:14:33.300]   Consensus actually does this.
[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:34.300]   They actually did it with EOS.
[03:14:34.300 --> 03:14:36.860]   And they wrote this lovely report like trashing EOS saying,
[03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:38.700]   hey, by the way, all those claims these guys made
[03:14:38.700 --> 03:14:39.920]   are just not true.
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:42.940]   But it's nice to do that.
[03:14:42.940 --> 03:14:45.020]   It's nice to use your competitors' technology
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:47.020]   or competing protocol technology
[03:14:47.020 --> 03:14:48.580]   'cause you learn a lot along the process.
[03:14:48.580 --> 03:14:50.260]   It's not all bad.
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:51.740]   There's always something there
[03:14:51.740 --> 03:14:53.840]   because they have different trade-offs and customers
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:55.420]   that potentially are more interesting.
[03:14:55.420 --> 03:14:56.780]   Like right now we're grokking,
[03:14:56.780 --> 03:14:59.480]   how do we wanna do the sidechain model of Cardano?
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:02.020]   Polkadot's actually a tremendously useful piece
[03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:03.840]   of infrastructure for that conversation
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:07.100]   because they copied part of our infrastructure.
[03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:08.740]   Gavin's a trained computer scientist.
[03:15:08.740 --> 03:15:12.900]   He got his PhD from York and he read our papers obviously
[03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:15.460]   and he realized that Ouroboros was a really good
[03:15:15.460 --> 03:15:18.460]   starting place for building a proof-of-stake system.
[03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:21.260]   So Polkadot's consensus is very similar to ours.
[03:15:21.260 --> 03:15:22.340]   And so if you're saying, hey,
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:24.400]   how do you do a good sidechain model
[03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:26.940]   with an Ouroboros-style proof-of-stake?
[03:15:26.940 --> 03:15:29.060]   Well, we already have this parachain thing, right?
[03:15:29.060 --> 03:15:31.320]   And so now by just looking at that,
[03:15:31.320 --> 03:15:34.560]   I can kind of get an idea of how, one way of doing it.
[03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:37.000]   And so that's just beautiful that we live in a space
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:38.460]   where that's there, it's open source.
[03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:40.220]   And if it's really good, you just say, okay,
[03:15:40.220 --> 03:15:41.900]   well, we'll just take that and adopt that.
[03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:42.820]   There's no shame.
[03:15:42.820 --> 03:15:46.900]   The other side of it is that Polkadot
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:49.860]   really has focused a lot on commercial adoption,
[03:15:49.860 --> 03:15:53.500]   Silicon Valley adoption, getting real use and utility.
[03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:55.740]   I say in a much more sustainable way
[03:15:55.740 --> 03:15:57.500]   than Ethereum is focused on.
[03:15:57.500 --> 03:15:59.700]   Ethereum was kind of a spray and pray thing.
[03:15:59.700 --> 03:16:02.020]   Polkadot was more of like, hey, let's go ahead
[03:16:02.020 --> 03:16:04.660]   and actually curate our ecosystem more carefully.
[03:16:04.660 --> 03:16:06.540]   And we're gonna build it in a way
[03:16:06.540 --> 03:16:09.500]   where there's predictable or as predictable a cost
[03:16:09.500 --> 03:16:13.020]   as possible with the rollout of the infrastructure.
[03:16:13.020 --> 03:16:16.640]   And that's so important for a business.
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:18.720]   It's not necessarily important for an experiment
[03:16:18.720 --> 03:16:20.860]   or a startup where they're just trying
[03:16:20.860 --> 03:16:22.980]   to get population as quickly as possible.
[03:16:22.980 --> 03:16:24.500]   We'll figure out later.
[03:16:24.500 --> 03:16:25.780]   But if you're actually sitting here saying,
[03:16:25.780 --> 03:16:28.460]   I need to know what my expenses are three years,
[03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:30.260]   five years, 10 years into the future,
[03:16:30.260 --> 03:16:31.980]   you need predictability there.
[03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:33.940]   I think they have a better shot of it than anything
[03:16:33.940 --> 03:16:37.700]   in F2 or with currently Ethereum.
[03:16:37.700 --> 03:16:40.500]   Now the big contrast between the two systems,
[03:16:40.500 --> 03:16:43.380]   those we actually have native multi-asset,
[03:16:43.380 --> 03:16:44.720]   we have a different accounting model.
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:47.340]   I think our base ledger is far more expressive.
[03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:49.000]   Our rate of evolution with proof of stake
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:50.220]   is much faster than theirs
[03:16:50.220 --> 03:16:51.620]   'cause they're based on derivative work
[03:16:51.620 --> 03:16:54.620]   and we already have Oroboros Omega and other things there.
[03:16:54.620 --> 03:16:56.660]   I think we have a better, ultimately,
[03:16:56.660 --> 03:16:58.580]   a better sidechain model will come
[03:16:58.580 --> 03:17:00.700]   because we have something called Mithril for that.
[03:17:00.700 --> 03:17:02.940]   But we learned a lot from their work.
[03:17:02.940 --> 03:17:04.860]   The other thing is that we thought about governance
[03:17:04.860 --> 03:17:06.660]   a lot more carefully, in my view.
[03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:08.340]   And we have Catalyst and Voltaire.
[03:17:08.340 --> 03:17:10.380]   And really the key there is saying,
[03:17:10.380 --> 03:17:12.140]   how do we make sure that every single person
[03:17:12.140 --> 03:17:14.820]   who holds data can participate in the network?
[03:17:14.820 --> 03:17:17.460]   That wasn't a high design priority of Polkadot.
[03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:19.780]   It was more fast commercial adoption,
[03:17:19.780 --> 03:17:21.060]   the acquisition of customers.
[03:17:21.060 --> 03:17:22.780]   We'll come to governance later.
[03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:25.900]   And those were just different business philosophies.
[03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:28.420]   But it's nice to have a competitor like that.
[03:17:28.420 --> 03:17:31.580]   And oftentimes I've said that Polkadot's like Ethereum 1.5.
[03:17:31.580 --> 03:17:33.700]   It's what F2 probably should have been.
[03:17:33.700 --> 03:17:35.180]   There was what Vitalik wanted to do,
[03:17:35.180 --> 03:17:38.700]   which was incredibly aggressive and brilliant.
[03:17:38.700 --> 03:17:39.900]   But it's a lot.
[03:17:39.900 --> 03:17:42.660]   And there's so much execution risk in that plan.
[03:17:42.660 --> 03:17:44.280]   And I think they've had like six years
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:45.700]   of playing around with it.
[03:17:45.700 --> 03:17:47.940]   Had they gone down the Polkadot road,
[03:17:47.940 --> 03:17:50.500]   they probably would have been a market with it in 2018.
[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:52.980]   And because they already had the network effect,
[03:17:52.980 --> 03:17:55.140]   they would have had years of building on that,
[03:17:55.140 --> 03:17:55.980]   iterating that.
[03:17:55.980 --> 03:17:57.420]   And they already had a path to it too.
[03:17:57.420 --> 03:17:59.300]   All they had to do was just give Elaine Shi
[03:17:59.300 --> 03:18:02.940]   and her cohorts at Cornell, $5, $10 million grants.
[03:18:02.940 --> 03:18:05.420]   No white would have been the dominant protocol,
[03:18:05.420 --> 03:18:08.300]   not Ouroboros in the proof of stake space.
[03:18:08.300 --> 03:18:09.700]   So it's really fascinating historically
[03:18:09.700 --> 03:18:11.260]   when you look at these things and the rivalries
[03:18:11.260 --> 03:18:12.780]   and what they did and what they didn't do.
[03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:17.780]   And Gavin had a chance to have C++ Ethereum
[03:18:17.780 --> 03:18:21.860]   be used as IBM's enterprise blockchain.
[03:18:21.860 --> 03:18:24.740]   The only reason they didn't do it is it was licensed GPL.
[03:18:24.740 --> 03:18:27.180]   And I think they wanted to relicense Apache.
[03:18:27.180 --> 03:18:28.580]   If you ever talked to Bob Summerwall,
[03:18:28.580 --> 03:18:31.020]   he was there at the time and he had this amazing story
[03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:34.140]   about these terrible fights where,
[03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:36.380]   it's like, guys, just relicense the goddamn code.
[03:18:36.380 --> 03:18:37.920]   Let's figure out a way to make this happen
[03:18:37.920 --> 03:18:40.380]   so that we can get this huge network effect
[03:18:40.380 --> 03:18:43.180]   of being basically IBM's play.
[03:18:43.180 --> 03:18:44.900]   They didn't do it, they created Fabric,
[03:18:44.900 --> 03:18:46.420]   these types of things.
[03:18:46.420 --> 03:18:49.880]   So there's a lot of lore and stories in that respect.
[03:18:49.880 --> 03:18:52.620]   But the space is better because of Polkadot.
[03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:53.980]   And there's a lot of good people there.
[03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:55.760]   Web3 is a good concept.
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:18:58.700]   And we run into their people in Germany and Zurich a lot.
[03:18:58.700 --> 03:19:00.700]   And they've always been cordial and friendly
[03:19:00.700 --> 03:19:02.900]   and really affable.
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:04.380]   - Before I talk to you about governance,
[03:19:04.380 --> 03:19:07.820]   which is one of the most fascinating things about Cardano,
[03:19:07.820 --> 03:19:10.280]   there's a lot of stuff to untangle there.
[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:15.280]   Since you mentioned some humans in this wonderful story,
[03:19:15.280 --> 03:19:20.140]   you did make a video before we talked,
[03:19:20.140 --> 03:19:23.420]   directed to me, thank you so much for that.
[03:19:24.820 --> 03:19:26.780]   - It came from a place of love, Lex.
[03:19:26.780 --> 03:19:29.440]   (laughing)
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:32.600]   - But it was basically saying, as we have been,
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:34.400]   you would love to talk about the technology,
[03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:37.400]   about the future that you're creating with Cardano
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:40.200]   and just the future of the cryptocurrency space.
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:42.880]   I think you were kind of worried
[03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:44.640]   that you'd be talking to a journalist
[03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:47.720]   that's looking for clickbait content, that kind of thing.
[03:19:47.720 --> 03:19:49.420]   But I'm fascinated by human beings.
[03:19:49.420 --> 03:19:51.560]   I think you're all, from an outsider perspective,
[03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:52.760]   incredible human beings.
[03:19:52.760 --> 03:19:54.320]   I don't know about personal intentions
[03:19:54.320 --> 03:19:55.280]   and all those kinds of stuff,
[03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:57.840]   but I think you're changing the world together
[03:19:57.840 --> 03:19:59.080]   in different ways.
[03:19:59.080 --> 03:20:02.500]   And I just wanted to sort of give you an opportunity.
[03:20:02.500 --> 03:20:06.440]   If there's, in the name of love and friendship,
[03:20:06.440 --> 03:20:09.700]   is there something from your history
[03:20:09.700 --> 03:20:12.400]   over the past decade or so, outside of technology,
[03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:13.980]   on the human side of things,
[03:20:13.980 --> 03:20:16.920]   that you draw inspiration from, you draw insight from,
[03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:18.800]   that you're just proud that happened?
[03:20:18.800 --> 03:20:21.960]   - I mean, it's like asking Paul McCartney about John Lennon.
[03:20:21.960 --> 03:20:23.200]   Tell us about John Lennon.
[03:20:23.200 --> 03:20:25.480]   It's like-- - How much do you hate Yoko?
[03:20:25.480 --> 03:20:27.400]   (both laughing)
[03:20:27.400 --> 03:20:28.640]   - For almost eight years now,
[03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:31.280]   it's just been this reoccurring pattern.
[03:20:31.280 --> 03:20:33.800]   Every interview, tell us about your time at Ethereum.
[03:20:33.800 --> 03:20:35.300]   Those six months you spent there
[03:20:35.300 --> 03:20:37.380]   that were so pleasant and enjoyable.
[03:20:37.380 --> 03:20:38.560]   Tell us all about it.
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:40.800]   And tell us about your relationship with Vitalik.
[03:20:40.800 --> 03:20:42.240]   It's like, I barely talk to the guy.
[03:20:42.240 --> 03:20:43.400]   I see him every now and then.
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:45.560]   Like, every two years, we say, "Hey," he says, "Hey."
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:49.160]   It's like, okay, maybe 10, 20 years in the future,
[03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:52.520]   Walt Mossberg or Robo-Walt will bring us together
[03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:55.840]   like he did Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:20:57.560]   and we can kind of talk about--
[03:20:57.560 --> 03:20:59.480]   - That was a tense conversation, by the way.
[03:20:59.480 --> 03:21:01.560]   - The 2007 interview? - Yeah, the 2007.
[03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:03.480]   - Great, though, wasn't it?
[03:21:03.480 --> 03:21:05.600]   - Yeah, that was the body language.
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:06.480]   That was art.
[03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:07.760]   - Yeah.
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:09.560]   - That was fascinating.
[03:21:09.560 --> 03:21:11.440]   That was a fascinating study of human nature.
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:14.080]   - Yeah, so maybe that'll be us in like 10 or 20 years.
[03:21:14.080 --> 03:21:14.920]   Who the hell knows?
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:16.360]   - The robot versions of all three of you.
[03:21:16.360 --> 03:21:17.600]   - Yeah, my only point, though,
[03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:20.660]   was that it's a closed chapter, and it's funny.
[03:21:20.660 --> 03:21:21.760]   I was there for six months.
[03:21:21.760 --> 03:21:23.800]   I've been building Cardano for years.
[03:21:23.800 --> 03:21:25.320]   We've done all this stuff.
[03:21:25.320 --> 03:21:27.160]   I've been to 52 countries.
[03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:29.600]   I love talking about those experiences,
[03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:30.600]   and there's so many of them.
[03:21:30.600 --> 03:21:31.840]   I've met heads of state.
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:34.960]   Mongolia, like eagle hunting,
[03:21:34.960 --> 03:21:39.180]   and getting bucked off horses, and riding the sand dunes.
[03:21:39.180 --> 03:21:43.860]   We've invented all this new cool technology
[03:21:43.860 --> 03:21:45.760]   that the space itself is using,
[03:21:45.760 --> 03:21:48.640]   and we've had a chance to sit on government panels,
[03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:51.360]   pass laws, 24 laws in Wyoming.
[03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:54.080]   I mean, there's like all this amazing stuff that's there,
[03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:55.600]   and it's such a fun conversation.
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:57.460]   There's so many superheroes in that conversation,
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:21:59.320]   like Caitlin Long and Taylor Lim Holm,
[03:21:59.320 --> 03:22:03.000]   and there's Alex Chirpinoy, who we already mentioned,
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:04.360]   that I met along the travels.
[03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:05.640]   I met Ralph Merkle.
[03:22:05.640 --> 03:22:08.080]   Cool, I met all these amazing people along the way.
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:10.000]   I have fond memories of,
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:11.440]   by the way, you should interview him, by the way.
[03:22:11.440 --> 03:22:13.280]   Amazing guy, does nanotech now.
[03:22:13.280 --> 03:22:16.480]   You know, I met, I was hanging out with Sylvia McCauley,
[03:22:16.480 --> 03:22:18.400]   and I remember before we launched Yale Grant,
[03:22:18.400 --> 03:22:21.200]   I said, "You should really just do a Bitcoin Cash-style play
[03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:22.240]   "and airdrop Bitcoin.
[03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:24.320]   "What the hell are you doing distributing this?"
[03:22:24.320 --> 03:22:26.480]   He's like, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing."
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:29.200]   You know, so it's like so many great conversations,
[03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:30.160]   and so many great people,
[03:22:30.160 --> 03:22:32.040]   and what I've really noticed in this industry,
[03:22:32.040 --> 03:22:34.780]   when you separate the tribalism, the maximum, and the side,
[03:22:34.780 --> 03:22:38.920]   there really is a love of creativity and building,
[03:22:38.920 --> 03:22:41.120]   and there's like no other industry like it.
[03:22:41.120 --> 03:22:42.980]   I've been in many different places in life,
[03:22:42.980 --> 03:22:44.960]   and here, people just love art.
[03:22:44.960 --> 03:22:45.800]   They love beauty.
[03:22:45.800 --> 03:22:47.600]   They love the unknown.
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:48.640]   They love pushing things.
[03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:52.160]   They love really, in some cases,
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:55.460]   not necessarily the most socially beneficial way,
[03:22:55.460 --> 03:22:57.600]   but they really love the challenge, right?
[03:22:57.600 --> 03:23:00.760]   And that has been fun.
[03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:02.640]   I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
[03:23:02.640 --> 03:23:07.480]   The dark side of the industry is that people love labels.
[03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:09.120]   They love saying, "This person's good.
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:10.340]   "This person's evil.
[03:23:10.340 --> 03:23:11.880]   "This person's a sociopath.
[03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:13.040]   "This person's not."
[03:23:13.040 --> 03:23:15.080]   And by the way, they've never met that person.
[03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:16.840]   They've never interacted with that person,
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:19.520]   and they just say, "Well, I heard from this person,
[03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:22.000]   "or I read this book, or I did that."
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:23.880]   I'll say, "Oh, so some book's written by a journalist
[03:23:23.880 --> 03:23:27.480]   "who makes $50,000 a year who's looking for a movie deal.
[03:23:27.480 --> 03:23:29.760]   "Say that somebody said this or did this
[03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:32.040]   "in an unconfirmed way."
[03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:33.760]   So what can you do, sue 'em for slander?
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:36.480]   I mean, so you just let it ride, and you let it roll,
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:38.540]   and if it was just ending there, that'd be great,
[03:23:38.540 --> 03:23:40.240]   but the problem is it cascades,
[03:23:40.240 --> 03:23:43.060]   and people just repost it, and they relive it again,
[03:23:43.060 --> 03:23:45.240]   and again, and again, and then what do you do about it?
[03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:46.840]   You eventually just say, "I'm not gonna talk about it
[03:23:46.840 --> 03:23:48.440]   "anymore, I'm done with it."
[03:23:48.440 --> 03:23:50.040]   And you move on, and you say, "You know what?
[03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:51.320]   "If it's your problem, it's your problem,
[03:23:51.320 --> 03:23:53.180]   "it's your reality that you wanna live in,
[03:23:53.180 --> 03:23:55.740]   "I'll be defined by the things that I achieve and do,
[03:23:55.740 --> 03:23:58.680]   "and the people that we help, and the things that we build."
[03:23:58.680 --> 03:24:01.000]   And since I started in this industry,
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.600]   I've gotten to a point where not only do we have
[03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:06.440]   this amazing company with these incredible people
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:09.000]   who work at this company, but we also have the ability
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:10.960]   to pursue amazing different interests.
[03:24:10.960 --> 03:24:14.280]   Like I met Ben Gortzel, and Ben and I are gonna do
[03:24:14.280 --> 03:24:17.480]   an AGI project together, and of all places, Rwanda.
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:20.240]   And he gave me this 85 fucking page paper,
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:22.600]   he was wearing that damn hat that he always wears.
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:25.600]   I think he showers with the hat on.
[03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:27.240]   He never takes that thing off.
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:29.360]   - I think you refused, I interviewed him,
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:32.080]   and he refused to tell me the story of the hat.
[03:24:32.080 --> 03:24:34.200]   - He wouldn't tell me either, I interviewed him as well,
[03:24:34.200 --> 03:24:36.760]   in Wyoming, and every time I call him,
[03:24:36.760 --> 03:24:39.160]   he'll have his shirt off, he'll have the fucking hat on.
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:41.120]   - And now all I can think about is the hat.
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:42.640]   I wonder what the story there is.
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:44.880]   - I know, it's like, it's gotta be--
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:46.040]   - That might be the AGI.
[03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:48.880]   - Yeah, exactly, but anyway, he gives me this 80 page paper,
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:50.960]   and he says, Charles, it's like the culmination
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:53.280]   of everything, this is how we're gonna do AGI.
[03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:54.480]   And I said, that's crazy, Ben.
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:24:56.480]   I said, I'll throw some money at it.
[03:24:56.480 --> 03:24:58.040]   So we're gonna hire some developers,
[03:24:58.040 --> 03:24:59.560]   and I have no idea where it's gonna go,
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:02.000]   but I mean, I get to hang out with Ben Gortzel.
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:04.320]   You know, that's fun, that's the kind of stuff,
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:06.440]   and that's the really cool side of the space,
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:09.160]   and it's what I enjoy.
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:12.440]   In the Vitalik Rival thing, the Ethereum thing,
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:14.560]   I try my best not to mention it.
[03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:16.720]   I hate the fact that still when Bloomberg
[03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:18.280]   or anybody else writes a story about me,
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:20.280]   they'll say Ethereum co-founder.
[03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:22.440]   Like, can you say something else?
[03:25:22.440 --> 03:25:24.600]   - Well, I think if I've learned anything from the internet,
[03:25:24.600 --> 03:25:25.920]   you can't resist that kind of stuff.
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:28.640]   You just have to, it's the Elon, it's the joke,
[03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:30.080]   joke it away.
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:31.800]   I've noticed this, this is already starting
[03:25:31.800 --> 03:25:34.240]   to happen with me, is like, people just make up stuff.
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:36.440]   They haven't made up anything interesting yet,
[03:25:36.440 --> 03:25:39.360]   but they could, and I've seen that with Bill Gates,
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:41.480]   for example, just stuff being made up.
[03:25:41.480 --> 03:25:43.160]   I mean, probably half of it is true.
[03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:44.760]   Sorry, internet, I'm sorry.
[03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:48.320]   But like, you know, I guess what I realized,
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:49.760]   this is the dark side of memes,
[03:25:49.760 --> 03:25:52.720]   is you can just make something up, and it'll spread.
[03:25:52.720 --> 03:25:53.760]   - Yeah. - And then that's it.
[03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:56.440]   And that's what happens, but then--
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:25:58.400]   - And the problem is half the world will believe it.
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:01.040]   - Yeah, it could be good stuff, it could be bad stuff.
[03:26:01.040 --> 03:26:04.320]   So I guess the hope is it bounces up in the end.
[03:26:04.320 --> 03:26:06.840]   I tend to believe you almost want to play with that,
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:09.240]   and not take it seriously, just kind of laugh it off,
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:10.840]   and enjoy life, and keep creating,
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:12.360]   keep doing awesome stuff.
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:13.240]   - Right.
[03:26:13.240 --> 03:26:16.140]   - Operating both in the physical space with other humans,
[03:26:16.140 --> 03:26:18.600]   and in the digital space with humans and AI systems,
[03:26:18.600 --> 03:26:19.560]   and just have fun.
[03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:21.680]   - Yeah. - 'Cause most of us,
[03:26:21.680 --> 03:26:24.080]   in the long arc of history, will be completely forgotten,
[03:26:24.080 --> 03:26:26.080]   none of it will matter.
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:29.760]   It'll all be some kind of, just like "Hitchhiker's Guide
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:31.600]   "to the Galaxy," will just be one sentence
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:34.360]   that summarizes all of our existence.
[03:26:34.360 --> 03:26:37.360]   And the sad thing is most of us will not be part
[03:26:37.360 --> 03:26:38.920]   of that sentence, or all of us.
[03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:41.040]   - Well, thanks for all the fish, Lex.
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:42.000]   - Thanks for all the fish.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:43.640]   The dolphins are running this thing,
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:46.280]   and they're talking to the UFOs recently,
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:48.120]   which is very interesting.
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:50.600]   'Cause the UFOs keep going to the water,
[03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:53.760]   so we humans assume that the UFOs are here to visit,
[03:26:53.760 --> 03:26:56.400]   the aliens are here to visit us, but it's probably the fish.
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:26:58.600]   - No, I just think it's next generation aircraft
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:00.120]   that we're using.
[03:27:00.120 --> 03:27:01.520]   - Oh, that we're just not aware of?
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:03.080]   But why are they talking to the fish?
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:05.760]   - Well, that's the place you'd test hypersonic aircraft,
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:06.680]   is over oceans.
[03:27:06.680 --> 03:27:08.440]   - So that's the Russians with their hypersonic
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:09.480]   nuclear weapons.
[03:27:09.480 --> 03:27:12.160]   That's what a lot-- - Rods from God, man.
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:13.760]   Rods from God.
[03:27:13.760 --> 03:27:17.780]   - So let me try to transition from UFOs to Abraham Lincoln.
[03:27:17.780 --> 03:27:22.960]   Lincoln said that nearly all men can stand adversity,
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:25.960]   but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.
[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:31.240]   Do you think power and money can corrupt most people?
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:34.000]   And if so, do you worry of this corrupting force
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:35.540]   on your own mind?
[03:27:35.540 --> 03:27:38.900]   You're one of the leading minds
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:40.420]   in the cryptocurrency space,
[03:27:40.420 --> 03:27:43.240]   you're the leader of the Cardano Project,
[03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:47.240]   you're the king-- - Of the rats.
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:48.440]   - Of the rats.
[03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:51.060]   Does this corrupt your mind,
[03:27:51.060 --> 03:27:53.260]   both the power and the money of it?
[03:27:53.260 --> 03:27:55.440]   - Yeah, I mean, you see this most pervasively
[03:27:55.440 --> 03:27:59.400]   with people who inherit a large amount of money or title,
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:02.520]   like dynasties, like the Melons or the Rockefellers
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:04.200]   or other people, it's the worst thing you can do
[03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:06.640]   to somebody is just hand them an enormous amount of power
[03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:08.880]   that they're not prepared for.
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:11.920]   And the challenge with this space is like everybody's young
[03:28:11.920 --> 03:28:13.440]   and we're all billionaires now
[03:28:13.440 --> 03:28:14.960]   and we have these cult followings
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:16.320]   and do all these things, right?
[03:28:16.320 --> 03:28:18.040]   Nobody really says no to you.
[03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:21.040]   Like for example, I have this ranch up in Wyoming
[03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:25.440]   and it has 400 bison on it, so now I'm a bison rancher.
[03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:30.440]   Like if somebody was like monitoring, auditing that,
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:32.400]   be like, Charles, do you have any experience
[03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:33.880]   raising, taking care of bison?
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:35.240]   I'd be like, no.
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:36.680]   So you think it's really a good idea
[03:28:36.680 --> 03:28:39.040]   to have this ranch with 400 bison running around.
[03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:40.280]   What the hell are you gonna do with bison?
[03:28:40.280 --> 03:28:42.280]   I just have to figure out what I'm gonna do
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:43.120]   with these bison.
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:45.240]   So, and I, you know, we'll make a video game,
[03:28:45.240 --> 03:28:46.440]   we'll do Crypto Bison.
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:49.520]   But you're gonna get one.
[03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:52.160]   - I'm not pulling, thank you, I'd love to.
[03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:53.720]   I'm not pulling at that string just yet.
[03:28:53.720 --> 03:28:57.680]   So I'm wondering how you're gonna connect this back to power.
[03:28:57.680 --> 03:28:59.920]   - Right, and so, but my point is that
[03:28:59.920 --> 03:29:03.640]   when you are unrestrained, like literally no one can say no
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:06.880]   or you have the ability to distort reality around yourself
[03:29:06.880 --> 03:29:10.320]   and you're not constrained by social customs,
[03:29:10.320 --> 03:29:15.320]   it creates a situation where you start losing perspective.
[03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:17.940]   You're not grounded anymore, I think.
[03:29:17.940 --> 03:29:20.800]   So it's less of a question of will you become evil or not,
[03:29:20.800 --> 03:29:22.920]   it's more of a question of will you lose so much touch
[03:29:22.920 --> 03:29:25.440]   with humanity that you just can't relate
[03:29:25.440 --> 03:29:27.520]   or understand people and then you inadvertently,
[03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:30.060]   by your actions, start harming people,
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:32.240]   either through the policies that you pursue
[03:29:32.240 --> 03:29:35.960]   or the things that you start building and so forth.
[03:29:35.960 --> 03:29:38.880]   So I think the best inoculation against that
[03:29:38.880 --> 03:29:40.940]   is to surround yourself with activities
[03:29:40.940 --> 03:29:44.140]   that are utterly divorced from your reputation and status.
[03:29:44.140 --> 03:29:46.900]   The best thing are animals and gardening.
[03:29:46.900 --> 03:29:48.280]   'Cause you know, a donkey doesn't care
[03:29:48.280 --> 03:29:49.440]   if you're a billionaire or broke,
[03:29:49.440 --> 03:29:51.360]   he'll shit on you exactly the same way.
[03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:55.880]   And so there's a humility behind these types of activities
[03:29:55.880 --> 03:30:00.580]   and these things and there's a honest work component,
[03:30:00.580 --> 03:30:03.460]   like when you grow hay or whatever, you have to plant.
[03:30:03.460 --> 03:30:05.200]   You have to actually water, you have to irrigate,
[03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:06.540]   you have to actually be there.
[03:30:06.540 --> 03:30:07.720]   You can't use some excuse,
[03:30:07.720 --> 03:30:09.780]   well I was meeting the president of El Salvador,
[03:30:09.780 --> 03:30:12.640]   I was doing this, the hay doesn't give a shit.
[03:30:12.640 --> 03:30:13.760]   It's hay, right?
[03:30:13.760 --> 03:30:14.880]   So it grounds and connects you.
[03:30:14.880 --> 03:30:17.280]   The other thing is you have to get used to giving away.
[03:30:17.280 --> 03:30:19.040]   All the best things in my life
[03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:21.440]   have come as a consequence of first giving.
[03:30:21.440 --> 03:30:23.120]   Like I got started in the cryptocurrency space
[03:30:23.120 --> 03:30:24.440]   by giving away a free class,
[03:30:24.440 --> 03:30:26.600]   Bitcoin or How I Learned to Stop Worrying or Love Crypto.
[03:30:26.600 --> 03:30:28.280]   You did a free podcast, right?
[03:30:28.280 --> 03:30:31.420]   In life, if you give and you develop that mindset
[03:30:31.420 --> 03:30:33.980]   of I'm not attached to the things I have
[03:30:33.980 --> 03:30:36.340]   and if push comes to shove, it goes away,
[03:30:36.340 --> 03:30:37.820]   usually you get more back.
[03:30:37.820 --> 03:30:39.820]   Like I gave away all my ether, I never received any.
[03:30:39.820 --> 03:30:42.220]   I have 293,000 ether at the all time high,
[03:30:42.220 --> 03:30:44.380]   over $1.2 billion.
[03:30:44.380 --> 03:30:46.100]   I gave it to my secretary.
[03:30:46.100 --> 03:30:48.020]   I had no idea if it was gonna be worth anything or not
[03:30:48.020 --> 03:30:49.620]   but he kinda got shafted and I was like,
[03:30:49.620 --> 03:30:51.900]   well, they don't like me so they don't like you
[03:30:51.900 --> 03:30:54.180]   by the transitive property of relationships
[03:30:54.180 --> 03:30:55.660]   so you're screwed.
[03:30:55.660 --> 03:30:56.780]   And he's like, well I'm gonna go back
[03:30:56.780 --> 03:30:58.480]   and my wife is probably gonna divorce me
[03:30:58.480 --> 03:31:00.080]   and all this stuff and what do I do?
[03:31:00.080 --> 03:31:01.180]   I said, well, I'll give you my ether.
[03:31:01.180 --> 03:31:02.880]   I don't know if it's gonna be worth anything.
[03:31:02.880 --> 03:31:04.760]   So he's doing pretty good.
[03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:09.180]   But then again, regardless of doing that,
[03:31:09.180 --> 03:31:11.360]   I now have Cardano, I have this great career,
[03:31:11.360 --> 03:31:12.760]   I've done all these amazing things.
[03:31:12.760 --> 03:31:16.040]   So I think that's the single best way of handling power
[03:31:16.040 --> 03:31:19.520]   is you have to do things to keep yourself grounded.
[03:31:19.520 --> 03:31:20.600]   In the case of Washington,
[03:31:20.600 --> 03:31:22.680]   he was deeply connected to Mount Vernon.
[03:31:22.680 --> 03:31:25.200]   During the Revolutionary War, he was like sending letters
[03:31:25.200 --> 03:31:27.420]   talking about the irrigation ditches and the barn
[03:31:27.420 --> 03:31:28.460]   and things like that.
[03:31:28.460 --> 03:31:29.900]   He was always connected to that
[03:31:29.900 --> 03:31:31.460]   and then also develop a mindset
[03:31:31.460 --> 03:31:34.220]   that you're only here temporarily.
[03:31:34.220 --> 03:31:35.660]   Everything you have is finite.
[03:31:35.660 --> 03:31:37.660]   It's going to go away at some point.
[03:31:37.660 --> 03:31:40.340]   No matter how much you want to keep it, you will die
[03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:42.460]   and somebody else will have it.
[03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:44.780]   So you live for the next generation.
[03:31:44.780 --> 03:31:45.780]   You don't live for yourself.
[03:31:45.780 --> 03:31:47.100]   You look to the future and you say,
[03:31:47.100 --> 03:31:48.380]   what am I going to leave behind?
[03:31:48.380 --> 03:31:49.980]   What am I going to transmit?
[03:31:49.980 --> 03:31:51.900]   And then in that kind of mindset,
[03:31:51.920 --> 03:31:54.960]   always forces you to be more gracious,
[03:31:54.960 --> 03:31:57.160]   cooperative and collaborative with people.
[03:31:57.160 --> 03:32:00.680]   All these dictators, they are egomaniacs
[03:32:00.680 --> 03:32:02.880]   and they connected these fantasies
[03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:04.080]   and they live for themselves.
[03:32:04.080 --> 03:32:05.240]   Look at Xi in China.
[03:32:05.240 --> 03:32:07.560]   He's unraveling a power structure
[03:32:07.560 --> 03:32:10.560]   that was what made China China today.
[03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:12.560]   After Mao, they said, we probably shouldn't have
[03:32:12.560 --> 03:32:13.840]   another one of those guys.
[03:32:13.840 --> 03:32:16.160]   And so they said, let's build something
[03:32:16.160 --> 03:32:17.840]   where there's checks and balances
[03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:21.120]   and no one person is going to run the whole show
[03:32:21.120 --> 03:32:24.200]   or else it'll descend and regress and we'll have problems.
[03:32:24.200 --> 03:32:27.240]   And then what he's done, he's thinking only about himself,
[03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:29.160]   not the best interest of China.
[03:32:29.160 --> 03:32:31.520]   So he's systematically unraveling a system
[03:32:31.520 --> 03:32:34.400]   they've been embracing for over 40 years.
[03:32:34.400 --> 03:32:35.840]   And to what end?
[03:32:35.840 --> 03:32:37.760]   After he dies, the next guy who comes in,
[03:32:37.760 --> 03:32:39.400]   even as he's super competent,
[03:32:39.400 --> 03:32:41.520]   the next guy is going to horrifically abuse
[03:32:41.520 --> 03:32:42.600]   that power structure.
[03:32:42.600 --> 03:32:45.160]   And the same thing happened with the Romans.
[03:32:45.160 --> 03:32:47.500]   After Augustus, the great emperor,
[03:32:47.500 --> 03:32:49.880]   then suddenly down the line you have Caligula
[03:32:49.880 --> 03:32:51.840]   and Nero and all these other terrible emperors
[03:32:51.840 --> 03:32:54.440]   that just destroyed everything that the Republic
[03:32:54.440 --> 03:32:56.520]   and the empire sought to achieve.
[03:32:56.520 --> 03:32:58.840]   So you have to think for the future.
[03:32:58.840 --> 03:33:01.080]   You have to think in institutions and systems.
[03:33:01.080 --> 03:33:03.280]   You have to have things that ground yourself
[03:33:03.280 --> 03:33:05.800]   and you have to be fully prepared to lose everything
[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:07.080]   and give up everything.
[03:33:07.080 --> 03:33:09.600]   After I left Ethereum, I had nothing.
[03:33:09.600 --> 03:33:12.920]   Okay, reputation was damaged, not a lot of money.
[03:33:12.920 --> 03:33:14.120]   Nobody really want to work with me.
[03:33:14.120 --> 03:33:16.560]   No one pick up a phone for two whole years.
[03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:18.000]   It was horrible.
[03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:21.080]   And so I was a bedrock in that experience.
[03:33:21.080 --> 03:33:22.640]   And now look at where I'm at.
[03:33:22.640 --> 03:33:24.240]   I built all the way up to that.
[03:33:24.240 --> 03:33:26.000]   And so that wasn't by accident.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:29.260]   It was I had to surround myself with amazing people.
[03:33:29.260 --> 03:33:31.360]   Why would amazing people want to surround themselves with me?
[03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:34.480]   If I was this narcissistic asshole
[03:33:34.480 --> 03:33:36.960]   who just was like, it's me, me, me,
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:41.360]   everything would be a transactional relationship.
[03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:43.240]   It would be, okay, we'll get as much as we can
[03:33:43.240 --> 03:33:45.320]   and then run away as quickly as possible.
[03:33:45.320 --> 03:33:47.680]   Instead it was, I'm going to invest in you.
[03:33:47.680 --> 03:33:49.480]   And maybe I'll win, maybe I won't win,
[03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:51.600]   but I'll be the last guy to leave the boat.
[03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:54.200]   If we're freezing to death, you get my coat
[03:33:54.200 --> 03:33:57.560]   and I'll just deal with the cold, that kind of mindset.
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:33:58.640]   You have to have that.
[03:33:58.640 --> 03:33:59.880]   I got that from my dad.
[03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:02.240]   He got it from his father.
[03:34:02.240 --> 03:34:04.160]   My grandfather and great-grandfather,
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:05.600]   my dad said grew up in Montana
[03:34:05.600 --> 03:34:07.920]   and they were like products of the Homestead Act.
[03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:09.920]   Very rough Montana.
[03:34:09.920 --> 03:34:11.920]   A lot of people died and froze to death up there
[03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:13.280]   or eaten by animals or something
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:14.840]   or shot by their neighbors.
[03:34:14.840 --> 03:34:16.840]   And nobody investigates anything
[03:34:16.840 --> 03:34:18.080]   'cause it's Montana.
[03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:21.720]   So the only way you survive is by taking care of each other
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:23.520]   and being a good member of that community.
[03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:24.640]   And if somebody gets big,
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:27.920]   you have this implicit desire to go and give back
[03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:30.160]   and take care of the community that you came from
[03:34:30.160 --> 03:34:31.560]   and invest in that community.
[03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:32.960]   Like I came from the mathematical community.
[03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:34.360]   I never completed a PhD,
[03:34:34.360 --> 03:34:36.040]   but one of the things that I'm doing
[03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:39.000]   is I'm gonna put $20 million and set up a center
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:40.360]   to do automated theorem proving
[03:34:40.360 --> 03:34:42.440]   and we're gonna heavily invest in lean
[03:34:42.440 --> 03:34:44.640]   'cause I'm super excited about mechanizing math
[03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:46.400]   and making a machine understandable.
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:48.320]   Now I know all these guys who do this work.
[03:34:48.320 --> 03:34:51.360]   There's like all these mathematicians and computer scientists
[03:34:51.360 --> 03:34:52.640]   and no one pays attention to them
[03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:54.720]   and they're kind of like the redheaded stepchildren
[03:34:54.720 --> 03:34:57.300]   of mathematics and they live on the boundaries and periphery.
[03:34:57.300 --> 03:34:58.880]   Meanwhile, they're super passionate
[03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:01.240]   and they absolutely love what they do.
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:05.200]   And if only they had the right resources,
[03:35:05.200 --> 03:35:06.920]   within 50 or 100 years,
[03:35:06.920 --> 03:35:09.160]   what they're doing can probably become the dominant model
[03:35:09.160 --> 03:35:10.800]   of how to do mathematics.
[03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:14.140]   So I'm now in a position where I have the financial means
[03:35:14.140 --> 03:35:15.800]   to take care of these guys.
[03:35:15.800 --> 03:35:18.040]   So all I have to do is just call them up and say,
[03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:19.640]   "Hey, would you like to work with?"
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:20.840]   "Oh, absolutely."
[03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:22.840]   And cut a check and it's done.
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:25.160]   - So the interesting tension here,
[03:35:25.160 --> 03:35:27.960]   so we talked about ways to prevent power
[03:35:27.960 --> 03:35:30.240]   from corrupting a human being
[03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:32.000]   that's in a leadership position.
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:35.960]   There's an interesting case in the cryptocurrency space
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:38.560]   of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto
[03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:40.840]   that basically doesn't have a leader.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:44.480]   So the benefit of a leader is somebody
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:48.480]   that perhaps even when they don't carry power,
[03:35:48.480 --> 03:35:51.640]   maintains a little bit of a flame of a vision.
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:35:55.200]   I suppose Bitcoin has that
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:57.800]   with the original work by Satoshi Nakamoto
[03:35:57.800 --> 03:36:02.600]   and the sort of that, even though it's anonymous,
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:05.120]   the idea still lives on through the community,
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:08.420]   but nevertheless, the leader is anonymous.
[03:36:08.420 --> 03:36:11.960]   Do you think this is an interesting case study
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:16.880]   about leadership is for the leader to maintain anonymity?
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:19.320]   - Yeah, it was a saying from Sun Tzu paraphrasing it,
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:21.920]   "The best leaders are felt but never seen."
[03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:22.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[03:36:22.760 --> 03:36:24.200]   So I think that's exactly right.
[03:36:24.200 --> 03:36:26.680]   The less the leader can be in the room
[03:36:26.680 --> 03:36:28.840]   and the more the principles of the leader are in the room,
[03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:29.920]   the better for the firm,
[03:36:29.920 --> 03:36:32.480]   because what you're doing is creating more leaders that way.
[03:36:32.480 --> 03:36:35.040]   You're inspiring the next generation, the next wave,
[03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:38.500]   the next circle out to act with those principles,
[03:36:38.500 --> 03:36:41.160]   but contribute in their own way and their own flair.
[03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:43.040]   And so you gain collective intelligence
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:44.120]   inside the organization
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:45.760]   instead of just constraining yourself
[03:36:45.760 --> 03:36:48.240]   to however great the leader can be.
[03:36:48.240 --> 03:36:49.080]   The other side of it is
[03:36:49.080 --> 03:36:51.420]   if the leader's principles are too strong,
[03:36:51.420 --> 03:36:52.760]   so this is the dark side of it,
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:54.360]   you end up with what's happened to Disney,
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:56.240]   with Walt Disney after he died.
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:36:58.160]   For 20 years, people said, "Well, you don't do that
[03:36:58.160 --> 03:37:00.600]   "'cause Walt Disney wouldn't do it that way."
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:02.200]   Or to a lesser extent, Apple.
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:03.280]   They say, "Oh, we don't do that
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:05.400]   "'cause Steve Jobs wouldn't do it that way."
[03:37:05.400 --> 03:37:06.920]   Well, he's dead, he's gone.
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:07.760]   Move on.
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:09.040]   - So somebody, I think, asked you
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:12.040]   whether you're a clone or a deepfake,
[03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:14.000]   and you said that you admitted,
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:17.320]   you slipped up on video saying that you're a deepfake.
[03:37:17.320 --> 03:37:18.160]   So on that--
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:20.840]   - I'm actually a poker-playing robot that escaped a lab.
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:22.280]   - The truth finally comes out.
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:23.680]   But I said on that topic,
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:25.640]   who do you think is Satoshi Nakamoto?
[03:37:25.640 --> 03:37:29.160]   Is it possible that you are, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto?
[03:37:29.160 --> 03:37:30.000]   - No.
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:35.760]   If you have a preponderance of the evidence,
[03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:39.080]   I think the most likely candidate would be Adam Back.
[03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:41.160]   It's the Occam's razor candidate,
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:43.800]   and mostly because he's the right place, right time,
[03:37:43.800 --> 03:37:46.080]   right age, right skill set.
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:48.480]   If you look at the design of Bitcoin,
[03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:49.440]   the types of decisions,
[03:37:49.440 --> 03:37:52.000]   like the use of FORTH, the scripting language,
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:53.440]   it was pretty common in English
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:56.120]   and European pedagogy in the 1980s and 1990s.
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:37:58.920]   It was like an example language for a stack-based assembly,
[03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:01.800]   and little stuff like that, little quirks like that.
[03:38:01.800 --> 03:38:03.080]   Also, he created HashCash,
[03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:05.200]   which was the predecessor of Proof of Work,
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:06.640]   and he's kind of got a chip on his shoulder
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:08.880]   that Microsoft never did anything with it,
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:10.280]   so he's probably looking for something.
[03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:11.840]   He grew up with all the cypherpunks.
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:13.680]   He knew of Hal Finney.
[03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:15.320]   He knew of all these people.
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:16.160]   He knew Phil Zimmerman. - You don't think
[03:38:16.160 --> 03:38:17.200]   it's Hal Finney.
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:21.040]   - Well, no, because the code was not good enough.
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:23.200]   Hal was a Unix, Linux guy.
[03:38:23.200 --> 03:38:24.960]   He was a talented programmer.
[03:38:24.960 --> 03:38:26.520]   He was a talented developer.
[03:38:26.520 --> 03:38:28.680]   The initial code for Bitcoin was developed
[03:38:28.680 --> 03:38:30.400]   to look like on a Windows machine.
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:33.600]   Adam worked at Microsoft, go figure.
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:35.200]   And also, it was very academic,
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:36.320]   and it had to be cleaned up,
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:38.960]   and a lot of things had to be patched up and fixed.
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:40.840]   If a guy like Hal developed it,
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:43.760]   it probably had less of the, you know,
[03:38:43.760 --> 03:38:47.420]   let's use SecP256k1 and these types of things,
[03:38:47.420 --> 03:38:48.720]   and more of like, hey,
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:50.780]   let's build this cool engineering thing,
[03:38:50.780 --> 03:38:53.280]   and we'll figure out the protocol design later on.
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:56.520]   It just stinks of an older academic,
[03:38:56.520 --> 03:38:58.000]   the initial design of Bitcoin,
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:38:59.480]   and the initial rollout of Bitcoin,
[03:38:59.480 --> 03:39:02.020]   and then brilliant people like Greg Maxwell and others,
[03:39:02.020 --> 03:39:03.840]   they came and cleaned it all up.
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:05.520]   And lo and behold, where's Adam?
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:07.000]   He's like the CEO of the largest
[03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:09.080]   Bitcoin development company in the space,
[03:39:09.080 --> 03:39:11.720]   who's trying to keep working on and building out Bitcoin.
[03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:14.840]   And where the hell was Adam when Satoshi was around?
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:17.080]   I don't think there was any overlap,
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:19.640]   where they were both together at the same period of time.
[03:39:19.640 --> 03:39:21.000]   But I mean, if you really care,
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:22.780]   you can even do this.
[03:39:22.780 --> 03:39:25.320]   There's a lovely paper written by the US Army.
[03:39:25.320 --> 03:39:28.540]   If you just Google like, Code Stylometry, US Army,
[03:39:28.540 --> 03:39:31.720]   it's a technique where you can use ML,
[03:39:31.720 --> 03:39:33.720]   and a few other things to actually kind of develop
[03:39:33.720 --> 03:39:36.320]   a fingerprint for the way that people write code.
[03:39:36.320 --> 03:39:39.320]   So all you got to do is take the original Bitcoin source code
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:41.600]   and then take all the open source repos
[03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:43.640]   from around that time period and before,
[03:39:43.640 --> 03:39:46.600]   and see if there's a match between those two.
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:49.560]   Now, if he's really good at creating an alias,
[03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:52.220]   probably not so good at obfuscating the code
[03:39:52.220 --> 03:39:53.100]   that was written.
[03:39:53.100 --> 03:39:55.320]   So the odds are that you'd probably find a match
[03:39:55.320 --> 03:39:58.120]   to a repo that's connected to a real life human identity,
[03:39:58.120 --> 03:40:00.320]   or at least a weaker OPSEC,
[03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:03.000]   because you're younger, you have weaker OPSEC.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:04.160]   - Do you know if people have tried that?
[03:40:04.160 --> 03:40:05.760]   - I don't think anybody's actually done it,
[03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:07.320]   but there's actually a beautiful paper,
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:09.680]   it's like 94% accurate, the Code Stylometry.
[03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:10.520]   - The Code Stylometry.
[03:40:10.520 --> 03:40:14.320]   So I've, for various reasons,
[03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:16.320]   I've worked with people that work on stylometry
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:17.760]   of natural language.
[03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:18.600]   - Okay.
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:22.280]   And I think it matches closest to Nick Szabo,
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:26.480]   if you actually do the written stylometry analysis
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:28.400]   of Satoshi's writings to stylometry.
[03:40:28.400 --> 03:40:30.080]   - So I meant stylometry as a field,
[03:40:30.080 --> 03:40:31.800]   I didn't actually look for application
[03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:33.560]   for this particular problem.
[03:40:33.560 --> 03:40:36.520]   But so you're saying Nick Szabo is the closest match.
[03:40:36.520 --> 03:40:37.840]   - Yeah, somebody did it years,
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:39.800]   I didn't look at if the model was sound or not,
[03:40:39.800 --> 03:40:41.520]   but I just remember reading on a Bitcoin talk,
[03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:44.240]   and Szabo is another one of the common candidates.
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:46.440]   Helphenny Szabo and Adam are probably
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:48.760]   the top three things that people could list.
[03:40:48.760 --> 03:40:51.060]   - What do you think about this idea of anonymity,
[03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:53.040]   of publishing something anonymously?
[03:40:53.040 --> 03:40:55.080]   Would you ever consider publishing a paper,
[03:40:55.080 --> 03:40:59.680]   you've been part of, I mean, the Cardano ecosystem
[03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:01.840]   has published a lot of incredible papers.
[03:41:01.840 --> 03:41:04.080]   Is there ever a value to publish anonymously?
[03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:06.960]   - Well, every paper that goes through the referee process,
[03:41:06.960 --> 03:41:08.420]   the authors are ripped off.
[03:41:08.420 --> 03:41:10.320]   So you don't actually see the authorship
[03:41:10.320 --> 03:41:12.320]   when you submit to the conference.
[03:41:12.320 --> 03:41:14.360]   So that's just best practice.
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:15.640]   But the question is, do you preserve
[03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:17.000]   the anonymity post-conference,
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:20.160]   and actually not reveal the author of the paper?
[03:41:20.160 --> 03:41:22.920]   It's a detriment for the deals we make,
[03:41:22.920 --> 03:41:25.640]   because the whole premise of working with our company
[03:41:25.640 --> 03:41:28.900]   as an academic is that you're gonna have amazing co-authors
[03:41:28.900 --> 03:41:31.100]   and your work is gonna appear in great conferences,
[03:41:31.100 --> 03:41:33.840]   great journals, and as a consequence, you get tenure.
[03:41:33.840 --> 03:41:38.400]   If you publish anonymously, it's like doing clearance work
[03:41:38.400 --> 03:41:40.280]   in high-energy physics or something like that.
[03:41:40.280 --> 03:41:42.840]   It's like, after 30 years of this amazing career
[03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:45.640]   working on nuclear weapons and classified reactors,
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:48.080]   you finish and then you go to apply for a job
[03:41:48.080 --> 03:41:48.920]   and they're like, "So what have you done
[03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:49.960]   "for the last 30 years?"
[03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:51.160]   "Stuff."
[03:41:51.160 --> 03:41:52.560]   (Luke laughs)
[03:41:52.560 --> 03:41:53.480]   "Where is it on your CV?"
[03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:55.180]   "Well, I can't really talk about it."
[03:41:55.180 --> 03:41:57.640]   "Okay, welcome to community college."
[03:41:57.640 --> 03:41:59.780]   So you get really screwed if you do that.
[03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:01.620]   So there's a misalignment of incentives
[03:42:01.620 --> 03:42:04.040]   in the academic world towards anonymity,
[03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:07.540]   and generally it's only done when you're doing something
[03:42:07.540 --> 03:42:09.740]   very controversial or there's a whistleblowing
[03:42:09.740 --> 03:42:10.940]   type of a component.
[03:42:10.940 --> 03:42:13.820]   It's not typically done for foundational work.
[03:42:13.820 --> 03:42:15.420]   And Satoshi was really one of the first things,
[03:42:15.420 --> 03:42:17.740]   'cause if there was a, Satoshi doxed himself,
[03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:19.600]   and I don't think it's possible anymore,
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:21.620]   but if he or she did that,
[03:42:21.620 --> 03:42:25.060]   that's like a Nobel Prize in economics, likely.
[03:42:25.060 --> 03:42:27.060]   You're on the short list for that.
[03:42:27.060 --> 03:42:28.900]   There's enormous accolades that would come
[03:42:28.900 --> 03:42:30.500]   beyond the monetary incentives
[03:42:30.500 --> 03:42:32.700]   of being able to dox yourself.
[03:42:32.700 --> 03:42:33.540]   But--
[03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:37.240]   - That'd be cool if they give a Nobel Prize in economics
[03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:39.380]   to an anonymous, to Satoshi Nakamoto.
[03:42:39.380 --> 03:42:41.660]   - It's been proposed and it was turned down.
[03:42:41.660 --> 03:42:42.500]   Yeah.
[03:42:42.500 --> 03:42:45.180]   So yeah, I mean, there are a few people in our company
[03:42:45.180 --> 03:42:47.480]   that have done pseudonymous publications.
[03:42:47.480 --> 03:42:49.800]   Like if you look at the Chimerical Edgers paper,
[03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:52.540]   that's a, it's not a real name, it's a crazy name.
[03:42:52.540 --> 03:42:55.260]   It's a pseudonymous publication.
[03:42:55.260 --> 03:42:58.380]   And, you know, but that's usually for throwaway work.
[03:42:58.380 --> 03:43:01.100]   There is one project we inherited from an anonymous person,
[03:43:01.100 --> 03:43:02.140]   which is fascinating.
[03:43:02.140 --> 03:43:03.740]   It's called QADDIS.
[03:43:03.740 --> 03:43:06.880]   And it's basically an extension of the QADD Manifesto
[03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:08.060]   from the '90s.
[03:43:08.060 --> 03:43:10.140]   And the pseudonym is Bill White.
[03:43:10.140 --> 03:43:12.160]   And I think it's some anonymous mathematician,
[03:43:12.160 --> 03:43:14.120]   but I can't figure out which one it is.
[03:43:14.120 --> 03:43:16.320]   But basically it's a marketplace for deduction.
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:19.080]   So it's like a, it's like this magic machine
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:20.860]   where you can create incentives for people
[03:43:20.860 --> 03:43:23.060]   to write mathematical proofs in a theorem prover
[03:43:23.060 --> 03:43:24.400]   and make some money from it.
[03:43:24.400 --> 03:43:26.780]   So there's some cool work that's there.
[03:43:26.780 --> 03:43:29.060]   And it's sad that Bill stayed anonymous
[03:43:29.060 --> 03:43:30.980]   'cause I think that could have been easily published
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:32.240]   and there was a lot of really cool things
[03:43:32.240 --> 03:43:34.380]   that could have been done with QADDIS.
[03:43:34.380 --> 03:43:36.340]   - So you did say the success of Cardano,
[03:43:36.340 --> 03:43:38.860]   sort of the vision you have is for you
[03:43:38.860 --> 03:43:41.300]   to have less and less power over time.
[03:43:41.300 --> 03:43:43.700]   So this idea of governance,
[03:43:43.700 --> 03:43:45.980]   what's your vision for a decentralized,
[03:43:45.980 --> 03:43:47.400]   secure governance system?
[03:43:47.400 --> 03:43:49.420]   - So the first thing you have to do
[03:43:49.420 --> 03:43:51.580]   is you gotta look at meaningful metrics,
[03:43:51.580 --> 03:43:52.980]   not vanity metrics.
[03:43:52.980 --> 03:43:55.840]   So what does it mean to have legitimacy
[03:43:55.840 --> 03:43:56.680]   in a governance system?
[03:43:56.680 --> 03:43:58.280]   You can build any governance system you want.
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:43:59.840]   You can have a dictator, right?
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:01.240]   Like Bob is in charge.
[03:44:01.240 --> 03:44:04.360]   It's like whether you like Bob or not, he's in charge.
[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:05.600]   That's not very legitimate.
[03:44:05.600 --> 03:44:06.920]   And you can have pure democracy
[03:44:06.920 --> 03:44:08.440]   where every single person votes
[03:44:08.440 --> 03:44:10.280]   and then nothing ever gets done.
[03:44:10.280 --> 03:44:12.880]   County dog catcher is like a six year election
[03:44:12.880 --> 03:44:14.100]   or something like that.
[03:44:14.100 --> 03:44:17.320]   So there's a spectrum there between absolute power to one
[03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:20.200]   and perfectly egalitarian power
[03:44:20.200 --> 03:44:23.440]   to every single potential participant inside the system.
[03:44:23.440 --> 03:44:24.940]   And then the question is, okay,
[03:44:24.940 --> 03:44:26.500]   well, how do you even architecture,
[03:44:26.500 --> 03:44:28.200]   how do you handle choice architecture in that?
[03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:31.940]   So like, are you asking your people about every question?
[03:44:31.940 --> 03:44:34.540]   Or are you asking your people about a subset of questions
[03:44:34.540 --> 03:44:36.340]   related to a particular set of topics,
[03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:38.660]   but then they're not allowed to talk about other topics?
[03:44:38.660 --> 03:44:40.680]   Like for example, are they allowed to change the tax rate,
[03:44:40.680 --> 03:44:42.480]   but they can't change freedom of speech?
[03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:43.740]   That kind of a thing.
[03:44:43.740 --> 03:44:45.740]   So the first thing you have to do
[03:44:45.740 --> 03:44:47.180]   when you build these types of systems
[03:44:47.180 --> 03:44:48.940]   and they get to a certain scale
[03:44:48.940 --> 03:44:50.820]   is you have to build some mechanism
[03:44:50.820 --> 03:44:52.740]   for people who are interested in governance
[03:44:52.740 --> 03:44:54.940]   to self-select and participate.
[03:44:54.940 --> 03:44:56.780]   Just create a collection bucket.
[03:44:56.780 --> 03:44:58.420]   In Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin Talk
[03:44:58.420 --> 03:44:59.920]   and Bitcoin Reddit and these things.
[03:44:59.920 --> 03:45:02.160]   And eventually the GitHub repos and these things,
[03:45:02.160 --> 03:45:04.740]   there was a place to go if you were interested.
[03:45:04.740 --> 03:45:06.700]   And you need some sort of change management system
[03:45:06.700 --> 03:45:08.740]   where people who want to evolve the system
[03:45:08.740 --> 03:45:10.460]   can write it down in a very careful way.
[03:45:10.460 --> 03:45:11.420]   So in Bitcoin's case,
[03:45:11.420 --> 03:45:13.860]   it was Bitcoin Improvement Proposal and Ethereum,
[03:45:13.860 --> 03:45:15.540]   it's the Ethereum Improvement Proposal.
[03:45:15.540 --> 03:45:16.620]   And for us, it's the SIP,
[03:45:16.620 --> 03:45:18.340]   the Cardano Improvement Proposal.
[03:45:18.340 --> 03:45:19.380]   But it's just a structured way
[03:45:19.380 --> 03:45:21.320]   of discussing how you wish to change.
[03:45:21.320 --> 03:45:22.780]   Then there's a question of,
[03:45:22.780 --> 03:45:25.820]   do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly?
[03:45:25.820 --> 03:45:28.820]   The case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it's an implicit system.
[03:45:28.820 --> 03:45:30.740]   So there's no on-chain voting.
[03:45:30.740 --> 03:45:32.740]   There's no like five people said this
[03:45:32.740 --> 03:45:34.860]   and four people said this, so we do this.
[03:45:34.860 --> 03:45:35.700]   In the case of Cardano,
[03:45:35.700 --> 03:45:37.500]   we're actually explicitly inviting this.
[03:45:37.500 --> 03:45:39.260]   This is one of the biggest differentiators
[03:45:39.260 --> 03:45:41.540]   between Cardano, Polkadot, EOS, and these other things
[03:45:41.540 --> 03:45:43.760]   is that we're really serious about governance
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:46.140]   to the extent that we're actually doing
[03:45:46.140 --> 03:45:47.900]   foundational research in e-voting.
[03:45:47.900 --> 03:45:49.420]   We're building new voting systems,
[03:45:49.420 --> 03:45:51.940]   we're exploring preference voting and quadratic voting.
[03:45:51.940 --> 03:45:54.140]   And the long and the short is that we want more
[03:45:54.140 --> 03:45:57.720]   and more people to participate in voting for things.
[03:45:57.720 --> 03:45:59.620]   And you have to start somewhere.
[03:45:59.620 --> 03:46:02.620]   So our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system
[03:46:02.620 --> 03:46:05.820]   with the treasury system.
[03:46:05.820 --> 03:46:08.740]   So in Cardano, some of the inflation
[03:46:08.740 --> 03:46:10.060]   goes to the block producers,
[03:46:10.060 --> 03:46:11.760]   just like any other cryptocurrency,
[03:46:11.760 --> 03:46:14.480]   but some goes into a decentralized treasury.
[03:46:14.480 --> 03:46:17.260]   China has over a billion dollars of ADA in it.
[03:46:17.260 --> 03:46:18.660]   So it's a lot of money.
[03:46:18.660 --> 03:46:20.660]   And that treasury is not under my control
[03:46:20.660 --> 03:46:22.100]   or the foundation's control.
[03:46:22.100 --> 03:46:24.820]   It's actually controlled by the community as a whole
[03:46:24.820 --> 03:46:26.380]   through a program called Catalyst.
[03:46:26.380 --> 03:46:28.020]   And so all these people can come together,
[03:46:28.020 --> 03:46:29.420]   they can submit spending ballots,
[03:46:29.420 --> 03:46:32.420]   and other people who hold ADA can vote to approve that.
[03:46:32.420 --> 03:46:34.580]   What's nice about it is you have a growth engine
[03:46:34.580 --> 03:46:36.740]   to improve two accesses.
[03:46:36.740 --> 03:46:38.660]   One is absolute participation.
[03:46:38.660 --> 03:46:40.660]   So increase the amount of people
[03:46:40.660 --> 03:46:42.220]   who hold ADA participating,
[03:46:42.220 --> 03:46:44.460]   so the absolute number of people participating.
[03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:46.660]   And the other is meaningful participation.
[03:46:46.660 --> 03:46:48.220]   So the depth of participation.
[03:46:48.220 --> 03:46:49.860]   Did you just show up and vote?
[03:46:49.860 --> 03:46:53.300]   Or did you spend hours debating things on IdeaScale,
[03:46:53.300 --> 03:46:54.940]   the innovation management platform,
[03:46:54.940 --> 03:46:56.660]   interacting with the funding proposal,
[03:46:56.660 --> 03:46:57.860]   going back and forth?
[03:46:57.860 --> 03:47:00.340]   And there's dozens of little things like that.
[03:47:00.340 --> 03:47:02.000]   Now my hypothesis is if you run this
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:02.900]   with enough iterations,
[03:47:02.900 --> 03:47:05.340]   eventually you get to a certain critical mass,
[03:47:05.340 --> 03:47:07.620]   like over 50% absolute participation
[03:47:07.620 --> 03:47:09.940]   and a high level of meaningful participation,
[03:47:09.940 --> 03:47:12.100]   where you can move beyond funding
[03:47:12.100 --> 03:47:14.700]   and you can start actually having meaningful questions
[03:47:14.700 --> 03:47:16.340]   about protocol design.
[03:47:16.340 --> 03:47:18.260]   And improvement proposals and so forth.
[03:47:18.260 --> 03:47:20.260]   And then what you can do is you can roll out
[03:47:20.260 --> 03:47:22.700]   new voting systems and new social structures,
[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:25.100]   and you can let them start voting on training wheels
[03:47:25.100 --> 03:47:26.100]   like system parameters.
[03:47:26.100 --> 03:47:28.180]   Like for example, the minimum transaction fee,
[03:47:28.180 --> 03:47:30.260]   or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools,
[03:47:30.260 --> 03:47:32.080]   or these types of things.
[03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:34.060]   Then they build enough competency there,
[03:47:34.060 --> 03:47:35.660]   and they move up a next level,
[03:47:35.660 --> 03:47:37.460]   and they actually start talking about hard forks,
[03:47:37.460 --> 03:47:38.580]   using the update system,
[03:47:38.580 --> 03:47:40.300]   the hard fork combinator system.
[03:47:40.300 --> 03:47:41.140]   See, so that's how you--
[03:47:41.140 --> 03:47:42.740]   - Voting on a hard fork.
[03:47:42.740 --> 03:47:43.940]   - Voting on a hard fork.
[03:47:43.940 --> 03:47:46.300]   You can't do it unless your social dynamics are right,
[03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:47.380]   and your voting system is right.
[03:47:47.380 --> 03:47:49.500]   And by the way, you also need to write a constitution
[03:47:49.500 --> 03:47:50.820]   around the same time.
[03:47:50.820 --> 03:47:53.400]   Because not all hard forks are created equally.
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:55.140]   The kinds of things that would add support
[03:47:55.140 --> 03:47:57.420]   for a new cryptographic primitive
[03:47:57.420 --> 03:47:59.180]   are distinctly different from the kinds of things
[03:47:59.180 --> 03:48:02.020]   that would change your monetary policy of the system.
[03:48:02.020 --> 03:48:04.660]   - So the constitution would be written,
[03:48:04.660 --> 03:48:05.780]   and maybe you can comment on
[03:48:05.780 --> 03:48:09.020]   what is the innovation management proposal system.
[03:48:09.020 --> 03:48:11.100]   - So we partnered with a company called Ideascale,
[03:48:11.100 --> 03:48:13.260]   and they run a kind of a side platform.
[03:48:13.260 --> 03:48:15.360]   So people who are interested,
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:16.820]   that's kind of our version of a forum.
[03:48:16.820 --> 03:48:19.220]   They sign up, and there's special tools in that platform
[03:48:19.220 --> 03:48:21.200]   for discussions that are productive.
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:22.980]   So they don't descend into kind of like trolly,
[03:48:22.980 --> 03:48:24.420]   Reddit-style conversations,
[03:48:24.420 --> 03:48:26.300]   but they're much more focused around
[03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:28.260]   how is your product building out.
[03:48:28.260 --> 03:48:29.100]   And by the way, we're gonna add
[03:48:29.100 --> 03:48:30.380]   more infrastructure over time.
[03:48:30.380 --> 03:48:32.420]   In fact, our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson,
[03:48:32.420 --> 03:48:35.340]   she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator,
[03:48:35.340 --> 03:48:36.900]   and we have lots of cool partners
[03:48:36.900 --> 03:48:38.160]   we've talked with in that space.
[03:48:38.160 --> 03:48:39.500]   And it's the same concept.
[03:48:39.500 --> 03:48:42.620]   Your idea comes in, what enters the system
[03:48:42.620 --> 03:48:44.740]   should not be what gets approved on the other side.
[03:48:44.740 --> 03:48:46.260]   It should go through some sort of gauntlet,
[03:48:46.260 --> 03:48:49.100]   some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through,
[03:48:49.100 --> 03:48:51.820]   and there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades
[03:48:51.820 --> 03:48:55.220]   and evolutions and combinations and destructions that occur.
[03:48:55.220 --> 03:48:56.420]   And then by the time you get to the other side,
[03:48:56.420 --> 03:48:58.500]   either the idea just dies on the vine
[03:48:58.500 --> 03:48:59.700]   'cause it was a bad idea,
[03:48:59.700 --> 03:49:03.060]   or it's a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing,
[03:49:03.060 --> 03:49:05.300]   and potentially even gets attached with accountability.
[03:49:05.300 --> 03:49:06.820]   So you don't just fund the idea,
[03:49:06.820 --> 03:49:09.500]   you actually fund the auditor at the same time
[03:49:09.500 --> 03:49:10.900]   who actually holds the person accountable
[03:49:10.900 --> 03:49:12.820]   'cause the blockchain is not a real company.
[03:49:12.820 --> 03:49:14.700]   It's an ethereal thing.
[03:49:14.700 --> 03:49:16.940]   You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable
[03:49:16.940 --> 03:49:19.940]   who's real for that type of stuff and that type of funding.
[03:49:19.940 --> 03:49:21.380]   So that's what we're doing this year.
[03:49:21.380 --> 03:49:23.100]   So we have a whole team of people,
[03:49:23.100 --> 03:49:25.700]   partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale,
[03:49:25.700 --> 03:49:26.980]   and papers we've written,
[03:49:26.980 --> 03:49:30.540]   and about 30, 40,000 people regularly participating in this.
[03:49:30.540 --> 03:49:32.460]   So it's a huge social experiment,
[03:49:32.460 --> 03:49:34.220]   and we're learning an enormous amount.
[03:49:34.220 --> 03:49:35.800]   And then our goal is by the end of the year
[03:49:35.800 --> 03:49:37.540]   to have a meaningful percentage
[03:49:37.540 --> 03:49:41.340]   of the entire Cardinal population inside of it, like 40, 50%.
[03:49:41.340 --> 03:49:42.660]   Then once you're at that threshold,
[03:49:42.660 --> 03:49:46.260]   now you have democratic majority of the entire system.
[03:49:46.260 --> 03:49:48.060]   Then you can have a real conversation about,
[03:49:48.060 --> 03:49:50.300]   okay, how do we write a constitution
[03:49:50.300 --> 03:49:51.580]   for this type of a system?
[03:49:51.580 --> 03:49:54.620]   - And sorry to interrupt, but so the constitution,
[03:49:54.620 --> 03:49:57.420]   people still argue about it because natural language,
[03:49:57.420 --> 03:50:00.700]   much like poetry, lends itself to multiple interpretations.
[03:50:00.700 --> 03:50:03.900]   Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas
[03:50:03.900 --> 03:50:07.580]   that reduce the ambiguity?
[03:50:07.580 --> 03:50:09.000]   - Everything's old is new again.
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:12.140]   We were talking about Logeban back in the day, right?
[03:50:12.140 --> 03:50:15.140]   So there's definitely formal languages you can use
[03:50:15.140 --> 03:50:15.980]   to express these things.
[03:50:15.980 --> 03:50:17.820]   That's why I'm so interested in things like Idris,
[03:50:17.820 --> 03:50:20.980]   and Koch, and Agda, and theorem proving,
[03:50:20.980 --> 03:50:22.980]   'cause that's exactly what you're attempting to do
[03:50:22.980 --> 03:50:27.420]   is to express some concept, or desire, or construction
[03:50:27.420 --> 03:50:29.060]   in a language that's machine understandable
[03:50:29.060 --> 03:50:30.140]   and manipulatable.
[03:50:30.140 --> 03:50:33.300]   In particular, how does the system know its own design?
[03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:35.460]   So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?
[03:50:35.460 --> 03:50:37.140]   Usually it's a canonical code base,
[03:50:37.140 --> 03:50:40.700]   like here's Bitcoin Core, and the C++ code,
[03:50:40.700 --> 03:50:42.620]   that is the canonical code base.
[03:50:42.620 --> 03:50:43.700]   But actually that's not right.
[03:50:43.700 --> 03:50:46.380]   You should have specifications, blueprints,
[03:50:46.380 --> 03:50:47.860]   that are implementation agnostic
[03:50:47.860 --> 03:50:49.180]   as your canonical code base.
[03:50:49.180 --> 03:50:51.380]   And can your system know those specifications,
[03:50:51.380 --> 03:50:52.860]   understand those specifications,
[03:50:52.860 --> 03:50:55.500]   and can your change management system be for that,
[03:50:55.500 --> 03:50:58.000]   and then can you provide a proof that your client
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:51:00.380]   is bisimilar to that specification?
[03:51:00.380 --> 03:51:02.180]   So that's 10 years in the future,
[03:51:02.180 --> 03:51:05.260]   but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept.
[03:51:05.260 --> 03:51:07.940]   - But you're tending towards a formalism.
[03:51:08.820 --> 03:51:10.820]   - Eventually, but that's not necessary
[03:51:10.820 --> 03:51:12.300]   for the system in the short term.
[03:51:12.300 --> 03:51:14.300]   It's good enough just to have,
[03:51:14.300 --> 03:51:17.740]   I know what a winner, and say the Haskell client is that,
[03:51:17.740 --> 03:51:21.260]   and then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP,
[03:51:21.260 --> 03:51:23.280]   and then once it's approved,
[03:51:23.280 --> 03:51:24.500]   then you go and implement that,
[03:51:24.500 --> 03:51:26.540]   and there's some mechanism to trigger the update system
[03:51:26.540 --> 03:51:27.380]   to update the reference client.
[03:51:27.380 --> 03:51:29.180]   - Do you have an example of a SIP,
[03:51:29.180 --> 03:51:31.140]   a Cardano Improvement Proposal?
[03:51:31.140 --> 03:51:34.340]   - Yeah, like the CURT Benefit Pledge, SIP 007.
[03:51:34.340 --> 03:51:37.220]   So the--
[03:51:37.220 --> 03:51:38.380]   - 007.
[03:51:38.380 --> 03:51:40.900]   - Yeah, everybody loves that.
[03:51:40.900 --> 03:51:41.740]   - Yeah.
[03:51:41.740 --> 03:51:44.380]   - I'm gonna change my luggage code now, Lex.
[03:51:44.380 --> 03:51:45.220]   - What is that?
[03:51:45.220 --> 03:51:50.100]   - So, yeah, so basically it just has to do with the pledge.
[03:51:50.100 --> 03:51:52.340]   So a pledge is a certain amount of ADA
[03:51:52.340 --> 03:51:54.660]   that a stake pool operator will set aside
[03:51:54.660 --> 03:51:57.980]   and connect to his pool in order to be listed
[03:51:57.980 --> 03:52:01.580]   in the registry, and actually it's connected
[03:52:01.580 --> 03:52:03.980]   to how much income you make as a pool operator.
[03:52:03.980 --> 03:52:07.460]   So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation,
[03:52:07.460 --> 03:52:08.660]   you have lots of pools.
[03:52:08.660 --> 03:52:11.020]   If you set it too low, what'll happen is larger pools
[03:52:11.020 --> 03:52:13.780]   will tend to fragment and actually run
[03:52:13.780 --> 03:52:15.460]   multiple instances of themselves.
[03:52:15.460 --> 03:52:16.980]   And so there's this delicate parameter
[03:52:16.980 --> 03:52:18.020]   that you have to tweak.
[03:52:18.020 --> 03:52:19.940]   And so we have a formula for it,
[03:52:19.940 --> 03:52:22.020]   our formal specification that's quite involved.
[03:52:22.020 --> 03:52:23.700]   And so one of the community members came and said,
[03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:27.140]   "Well, I think we can massively simplify this design
[03:52:27.140 --> 03:52:28.580]   and actually get a better result
[03:52:28.580 --> 03:52:30.900]   for smaller stake pool operators."
[03:52:30.900 --> 03:52:33.780]   And so it's SIP 007, and there's actually a lot
[03:52:33.780 --> 03:52:35.620]   of conversation and people are thinking about it.
[03:52:35.620 --> 03:52:37.540]   And it was just stunning for me,
[03:52:37.540 --> 03:52:39.620]   'cause to understand how to write a SIP like this,
[03:52:39.620 --> 03:52:41.420]   you actually have to read like 100 pages
[03:52:41.420 --> 03:52:44.700]   of mathematical prose in the formal specification.
[03:52:44.700 --> 03:52:47.500]   So the guys who wrote it was like, "Fuck yeah,
[03:52:47.500 --> 03:52:48.340]   this is great."
[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:51.380]   But it's an example of a SIP, but that's one thing,
[03:52:51.380 --> 03:52:53.580]   but it could be as big as, "Hey, I wanna add
[03:52:53.580 --> 03:52:55.580]   like quantum resistance to this system,
[03:52:55.580 --> 03:52:57.900]   and here's how you do that, you know, like quantum VRF,
[03:52:57.900 --> 03:53:00.700]   and I wanna put XMSS and all this other stuff."
[03:53:00.700 --> 03:53:03.460]   So there's a lot you can do, and you can do it
[03:53:03.460 --> 03:53:07.460]   in, you can do it indirectly or implicitly,
[03:53:07.460 --> 03:53:10.140]   where there's some social process outside of the system
[03:53:10.140 --> 03:53:12.460]   where you eventually approve a SIP,
[03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:14.660]   or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote
[03:53:14.660 --> 03:53:16.940]   or some representative democracy,
[03:53:16.940 --> 03:53:19.260]   some group of representatives directly votes,
[03:53:19.260 --> 03:53:21.220]   and then once you've decided, it's there.
[03:53:21.220 --> 03:53:22.900]   The constitution's necessary because you need
[03:53:22.900 --> 03:53:24.740]   to know the decision threshold.
[03:53:24.740 --> 03:53:27.020]   Is it super majority or majority?
[03:53:27.020 --> 03:53:29.100]   And also the voting process.
[03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:30.820]   Like a lot of policy experts believe
[03:53:30.820 --> 03:53:32.940]   that if Brexit was a multi-stage vote,
[03:53:32.940 --> 03:53:34.460]   it would have never passed,
[03:53:34.460 --> 03:53:36.540]   because what people would have done the initial stage
[03:53:36.540 --> 03:53:37.780]   and all the horrors of Brexit
[03:53:37.780 --> 03:53:39.740]   would have been broadcast to society,
[03:53:39.740 --> 03:53:41.220]   and there would have been some reluctance
[03:53:41.220 --> 03:53:42.980]   and buyer's remorse on it,
[03:53:42.980 --> 03:53:44.620]   and then the second round would have failed
[03:53:44.620 --> 03:53:46.020]   or something like that.
[03:53:46.020 --> 03:53:47.900]   But because it was just a single-year event,
[03:53:47.900 --> 03:53:49.700]   you know, it's like they passed it,
[03:53:49.700 --> 03:53:51.860]   now British are all passive-aggressive about it.
[03:53:51.860 --> 03:53:55.740]   With no sign, "Very well, we shall remove from Europe."
[03:53:55.740 --> 03:53:58.700]   And so your voting system has a lot to do
[03:53:58.700 --> 03:53:59.900]   with the outcome you get.
[03:53:59.900 --> 03:54:01.580]   The other thing is, you know, what type of voting?
[03:54:01.580 --> 03:54:04.180]   Is it just an absolute or is it preference voting?
[03:54:04.180 --> 03:54:06.220]   So you pick your favorite SIP,
[03:54:06.220 --> 03:54:08.900]   follow your second favorite SIP or something like that.
[03:54:08.900 --> 03:54:11.100]   So Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems--
[03:54:11.100 --> 03:54:13.140]   - Are you a fan of those, like the rank-choice vote?
[03:54:13.140 --> 03:54:16.380]   - I love them so much, especially for political diversity,
[03:54:16.380 --> 03:54:18.820]   'cause this whole concept of throwing your vote away,
[03:54:18.820 --> 03:54:21.140]   if it's Alice or Bob, you're always gonna get a,
[03:54:21.140 --> 03:54:23.580]   and South Park did it best, right?
[03:54:23.580 --> 03:54:25.100]   The giant-- - Turd.
[03:54:25.100 --> 03:54:26.620]   - Yeah, yeah, you know the one.
[03:54:26.620 --> 03:54:28.060]   - Turd versus, I forget what else.
[03:54:28.060 --> 03:54:29.660]   - The douche. - Douche versus Turd.
[03:54:29.660 --> 03:54:31.820]   - Douche versus Turd, South Park.
[03:54:31.820 --> 03:54:34.540]   So if it's ranked order or preference voting,
[03:54:34.540 --> 03:54:35.660]   you never have that situation,
[03:54:35.660 --> 03:54:36.860]   'cause you always pick your favorite,
[03:54:36.860 --> 03:54:38.620]   and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot.
[03:54:38.620 --> 03:54:39.900]   But then you have Arrow's Paradox
[03:54:39.900 --> 03:54:41.860]   and all these other things that come up.
[03:54:41.860 --> 03:54:44.060]   So there's no perfect system,
[03:54:44.060 --> 03:54:46.820]   and really you have to be comfortable
[03:54:46.820 --> 03:54:48.860]   with governance in a game of inches.
[03:54:48.860 --> 03:54:51.300]   And you start by some guiding principles,
[03:54:51.300 --> 03:54:53.500]   and the guiding principles is more is better,
[03:54:53.500 --> 03:54:55.960]   and productive interactions are better
[03:54:55.960 --> 03:54:57.260]   than destructive interactions.
[03:54:57.260 --> 03:54:58.860]   And you have to be able to quantify those things.
[03:54:58.860 --> 03:55:00.060]   As long as you have an engine
[03:55:00.060 --> 03:55:02.160]   that allows you to grow in those directions,
[03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:04.100]   then you have a lot more people along for the ride
[03:55:04.100 --> 03:55:05.520]   when you actually start talking about
[03:55:05.520 --> 03:55:07.220]   these bigger and bigger things.
[03:55:07.220 --> 03:55:08.500]   The other challenge was that we had
[03:55:08.500 --> 03:55:10.580]   the decentralized development of the protocol
[03:55:10.580 --> 03:55:12.900]   and the brain of the protocol.
[03:55:12.900 --> 03:55:15.380]   We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol.
[03:55:15.380 --> 03:55:17.660]   The peer review academic process means that
[03:55:17.660 --> 03:55:19.420]   there's now an academic incentive
[03:55:19.420 --> 03:55:22.240]   for graduate students, postdocs, and professors
[03:55:22.240 --> 03:55:23.780]   to spend enormous amounts of time
[03:55:23.780 --> 03:55:25.780]   writing papers in our ecosystem,
[03:55:25.780 --> 03:55:27.420]   'cause they want tenure.
[03:55:27.420 --> 03:55:30.140]   They wanna, and we showed that you can get it.
[03:55:30.140 --> 03:55:32.060]   There's been a lot of people who've gotten
[03:55:32.060 --> 03:55:34.320]   great academic careers from working with us.
[03:55:34.320 --> 03:55:37.700]   So yeah, keep adding to that pile of 105 papers.
[03:55:37.700 --> 03:55:38.900]   This is great.
[03:55:38.900 --> 03:55:40.500]   And that doesn't need Charles Hoskinson.
[03:55:40.500 --> 03:55:42.780]   It doesn't need IOHK funding or anything like that.
[03:55:42.780 --> 03:55:43.620]   They're on.
[03:55:43.620 --> 03:55:45.100]   We're already seeing unfunded derivative work
[03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:46.620]   from people who are completely disconnected
[03:55:46.620 --> 03:55:49.580]   from us writing papers about stuff in our ecosystem.
[03:55:49.580 --> 03:55:53.020]   So just continue to develop that, but that's looking good.
[03:55:53.020 --> 03:55:55.140]   The centralized development, we're working on that as well.
[03:55:55.140 --> 03:55:57.140]   Our goal is sometime in the next few years
[03:55:57.140 --> 03:56:00.060]   to make sure there's at least three independent clients.
[03:56:00.060 --> 03:56:03.060]   So three completely independent dev teams and code bases,
[03:56:03.060 --> 03:56:06.860]   and also to get a separation of the commercial clients
[03:56:06.860 --> 03:56:09.320]   from the reference code, and turn the reference code
[03:56:09.320 --> 03:56:12.140]   into like a formal specification, a formal blueprint,
[03:56:12.140 --> 03:56:14.100]   and then have that change management
[03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:15.660]   be completely decentralized.
[03:56:15.660 --> 03:56:17.900]   The core developers are actually voted on,
[03:56:17.900 --> 03:56:21.140]   and the SIP process is used to change that,
[03:56:21.140 --> 03:56:24.020]   and then some way of proving that your client
[03:56:24.020 --> 03:56:28.180]   follows the specification as use of the protocol.
[03:56:28.180 --> 03:56:30.860]   - Is there beyond the Cardano ecosystem,
[03:56:30.860 --> 03:56:35.380]   these ideas of distributed governance,
[03:56:35.380 --> 03:56:40.380]   do you see ways it could revolutionize politics?
[03:56:40.380 --> 03:56:41.340]   - Yeah.
[03:56:41.340 --> 03:56:42.420]   - Or governments?
[03:56:42.420 --> 03:56:45.340]   - Oh yeah, like Ethiopia deal, for example.
[03:56:45.340 --> 03:56:47.220]   We have 5 million people that we brought in
[03:56:47.220 --> 03:56:49.260]   with the DID system there.
[03:56:49.260 --> 03:56:51.140]   That's gonna follow them throughout their whole life.
[03:56:51.140 --> 03:56:52.940]   Right now they're high school students,
[03:56:52.940 --> 03:56:54.380]   but when they're in their 20s, 30s,
[03:56:54.380 --> 03:56:55.900]   they're gonna wanna use that for e-voting,
[03:56:55.900 --> 03:56:57.620]   and for payments, and so forth.
[03:56:57.620 --> 03:56:59.100]   - Can you describe the Ethiopia project,
[03:56:59.100 --> 03:57:00.500]   'cause that's fascinating.
[03:57:00.500 --> 03:57:02.580]   - Yeah, so we spent four years in Ethiopia.
[03:57:02.580 --> 03:57:05.380]   I went there in 2017, and shook a lot of hands,
[03:57:05.380 --> 03:57:06.580]   kissed a lot of babies, and they said,
[03:57:06.580 --> 03:57:08.540]   "Oh yeah, we'll have it all done in six months."
[03:57:08.540 --> 03:57:10.060]   (laughing)
[03:57:10.060 --> 03:57:11.620]   Everything is a lot of fun there,
[03:57:11.620 --> 03:57:13.800]   but it takes a little bit longer than you'd think
[03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:15.780]   to get anything done, and that's okay.
[03:57:15.780 --> 03:57:19.060]   I really love Ethiopia, it's a beautiful country.
[03:57:19.060 --> 03:57:21.860]   So we spent four years, we trained a whole cohort
[03:57:21.860 --> 03:57:23.780]   of developers, and then we started a relationship
[03:57:23.780 --> 03:57:25.140]   with the Ministry of Education,
[03:57:25.140 --> 03:57:28.300]   and they care a lot about proper credentials.
[03:57:28.300 --> 03:57:30.200]   One of the biggest problems they have is,
[03:57:30.200 --> 03:57:32.260]   when someone graduates, it's really hard for them
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:34.620]   to prove the quality of the credentials that they have,
[03:57:34.620 --> 03:57:35.860]   and really hard for them to prove
[03:57:35.860 --> 03:57:37.180]   the knowledge that they have.
[03:57:37.180 --> 03:57:39.260]   So if you wanna be an ICT outsourcer,
[03:57:39.260 --> 03:57:41.940]   how does somebody know that this is a real programmer,
[03:57:41.940 --> 03:57:44.220]   or how does somebody really know that this is a real doctor,
[03:57:44.220 --> 03:57:46.220]   or whatever the hell you're outsourcing?
[03:57:46.220 --> 03:57:47.620]   So they said, "Can you come and build
[03:57:47.620 --> 03:57:50.660]   "a digital identity system for credentials?"
[03:57:50.660 --> 03:57:52.940]   So every student in the country, at some point,
[03:57:52.940 --> 03:57:55.260]   will get a DID, a decentralized identifier,
[03:57:55.260 --> 03:57:58.160]   and then you can prove all sorts of things about them,
[03:57:58.160 --> 03:58:00.960]   like GPA, or what particular diploma they hold,
[03:58:00.960 --> 03:58:02.300]   or blah, blah, blah.
[03:58:02.300 --> 03:58:04.540]   And then the beautiful thing is, the way we designed it,
[03:58:04.540 --> 03:58:07.500]   is it's extensible to include payments,
[03:58:07.500 --> 03:58:10.260]   extensible to include proofs about themselves,
[03:58:10.260 --> 03:58:12.740]   like are you over the age of 21, that kind of stuff.
[03:58:12.740 --> 03:58:14.120]   And then eventually it can be used
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:16.140]   to link into a cryptocurrency system.
[03:58:16.140 --> 03:58:18.140]   In this case, we built it for Cardano.
[03:58:18.140 --> 03:58:20.820]   So Atala Prism is the framework we're using for it.
[03:58:20.820 --> 03:58:23.100]   Every student will get one, and then those students
[03:58:23.100 --> 03:58:25.420]   will be able to use those credentials
[03:58:25.420 --> 03:58:28.060]   in the Cardano ecosystem, eventually for DeFi,
[03:58:28.060 --> 03:58:29.180]   like lending and so forth.
[03:58:29.180 --> 03:58:31.260]   So it's the largest blockchain deal of its kind,
[03:58:31.260 --> 03:58:33.940]   and it probably will grow to 20 million people
[03:58:33.940 --> 03:58:35.500]   over the next 24 months.
[03:58:35.500 --> 03:58:37.100]   The other beautiful thing about Ethiopia
[03:58:37.100 --> 03:58:38.900]   that people don't know is the prime minister
[03:58:38.900 --> 03:58:40.380]   is a cryptographer.
[03:58:40.380 --> 03:58:43.020]   He's in his 40s, 50s, a young guy,
[03:58:43.020 --> 03:58:45.300]   and he can actually read the papers we write.
[03:58:45.300 --> 03:58:46.860]   And so he's a really bright guy,
[03:58:46.860 --> 03:58:48.940]   and he's written this beautiful agenda
[03:58:48.940 --> 03:58:51.260]   called Digital Ethiopia 2025.
[03:58:51.260 --> 03:58:55.700]   And one of his things in the agenda is digital identity.
[03:58:55.700 --> 03:58:57.220]   He wants every person in the country
[03:58:57.220 --> 03:58:59.940]   to have a digital identity by 2025,
[03:58:59.940 --> 03:59:01.860]   and he wants to implement an e-voting system
[03:59:01.860 --> 03:59:03.380]   at some point for that.
[03:59:03.380 --> 03:59:04.820]   So when you ask about governance,
[03:59:04.820 --> 03:59:07.160]   all these governance tools that we're constructing
[03:59:07.160 --> 03:59:11.380]   for Cardano are completely reusable for a nation state,
[03:59:11.380 --> 03:59:13.040]   a company, and by the way, if you create
[03:59:13.040 --> 03:59:16.260]   a Cardano application, will eventually be reusable for you.
[03:59:16.260 --> 03:59:17.700]   'Cause if you have a DeFi protocol,
[03:59:17.700 --> 03:59:18.660]   you need a voting system,
[03:59:18.660 --> 03:59:20.260]   why the fuck do you have to reimplement that?
[03:59:20.260 --> 03:59:22.940]   Native multi-asset, anything that works on ADA
[03:59:22.940 --> 03:59:24.620]   works with a native multi-asset.
[03:59:24.620 --> 03:59:27.020]   You can use our voting system for your asset.
[03:59:27.020 --> 03:59:28.620]   So you get a government in a box
[03:59:28.620 --> 03:59:31.140]   that you can parametrize any way you want.
[03:59:31.140 --> 03:59:33.100]   And similarly, when a government does something
[03:59:33.100 --> 03:59:34.940]   with Cardano, not only do they get
[03:59:34.940 --> 03:59:38.220]   all this amazing infrastructure, but wait, there's more.
[03:59:38.220 --> 03:59:40.220]   They actually get this amazing voting system
[03:59:40.220 --> 03:59:43.100]   that they can use for smaller, large-scale decisions
[03:59:43.100 --> 03:59:44.180]   that they wanna do.
[03:59:44.180 --> 03:59:46.340]   On the US side, we're thinking about trying
[03:59:46.340 --> 03:59:49.100]   to roll something like this out in the state of Wyoming.
[03:59:49.100 --> 03:59:50.900]   There's been tons of laws that are passed.
[03:59:50.900 --> 03:59:52.940]   It's a very friendly crypto place.
[03:59:52.940 --> 03:59:54.780]   The very least, it'd be fun to see
[03:59:54.780 --> 03:59:57.140]   if we can do the Republican-Democrat primaries
[03:59:57.140 --> 04:00:00.380]   with preference voting and voter registration this way
[04:00:00.380 --> 04:00:03.860]   and do it completely online with an e-voting system.
[04:00:03.860 --> 04:00:06.580]   So that's something we'll be pursuing in 2022.
[04:00:06.580 --> 04:00:08.060]   - You think there's some openness to that?
[04:00:08.060 --> 04:00:09.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[04:00:09.460 --> 04:00:11.420]   That's the one good thing about the craziness of Trump.
[04:00:11.420 --> 04:00:13.560]   He made like half of America think the election system
[04:00:13.560 --> 04:00:15.660]   is completely, irreparably broken.
[04:00:15.660 --> 04:00:18.340]   So you walk in, it's like, we're gonna go kill Dominion.
[04:00:18.340 --> 04:00:20.940]   And they're like, yay, that's great, let's go do that.
[04:00:20.940 --> 04:00:23.060]   Whether you believe that or not,
[04:00:23.060 --> 04:00:24.500]   it's created a market opportunity,
[04:00:24.500 --> 04:00:26.940]   created a lack of faith and credibility in the system.
[04:00:26.940 --> 04:00:30.220]   - To improve the system. - Exactly, exactly.
[04:00:30.220 --> 04:00:32.260]   - What do you think about El Salvador
[04:00:32.260 --> 04:00:35.860]   becoming the first country to approve a cryptocurrency,
[04:00:35.860 --> 04:00:39.100]   Bitcoin in this case, as a legal currency?
[04:00:39.100 --> 04:00:40.660]   And where's this trend going?
[04:00:40.660 --> 04:00:43.100]   First of all, this event, if you mentioned
[04:00:43.100 --> 04:00:46.020]   the Bitcoin conference, the Bitcoin folks believe
[04:00:46.020 --> 04:00:47.500]   that this is a monumental event.
[04:00:47.500 --> 04:00:49.860]   Do you think this is a start of something new?
[04:00:49.860 --> 04:00:53.420]   - Well, they're both right, the critics and the pro people.
[04:00:53.420 --> 04:00:55.540]   So the critics are saying this is a nothing burger
[04:00:55.540 --> 04:00:58.220]   and it's just a publicity event for El Salvador.
[04:00:58.220 --> 04:01:00.740]   And then the people say this is the most monumental event.
[04:01:00.740 --> 04:01:02.000]   They may actually be right
[04:01:02.000 --> 04:01:04.260]   because there's reciprocal agreements.
[04:01:04.260 --> 04:01:06.060]   When a country issues a currency,
[04:01:06.060 --> 04:01:08.220]   other countries honor that usually.
[04:01:08.220 --> 04:01:09.800]   And it trades on forex exchanges.
[04:01:09.800 --> 04:01:12.860]   So if like Bitcoin becomes a recognized currency
[04:01:12.860 --> 04:01:15.460]   of a country, then it may be the case
[04:01:15.460 --> 04:01:17.460]   that United States and European Union and others
[04:01:17.460 --> 04:01:20.500]   can't actually stop them from trading on forex exchanges
[04:01:20.500 --> 04:01:22.260]   and being treated as a currency
[04:01:22.260 --> 04:01:23.620]   from a regulatory perspective.
[04:01:23.620 --> 04:01:26.180]   So it's like a really clever backdoor
[04:01:26.180 --> 04:01:28.940]   into the League of Nations.
[04:01:28.940 --> 04:01:31.940]   And actually we had this crazy harebrained idea years ago.
[04:01:31.940 --> 04:01:34.460]   We were down in Mexico at the Satoshi round table
[04:01:34.460 --> 04:01:36.640]   and we're like, hey, let's go buy a country.
[04:01:36.640 --> 04:01:39.160]   Let's go to Tuvalu and get them to do something
[04:01:39.160 --> 04:01:40.500]   with the cryptocurrency.
[04:01:40.500 --> 04:01:42.080]   'Cause they sell everything in Tuvalu,
[04:01:42.080 --> 04:01:44.780]   like the dot TV extension and their fishing rights
[04:01:44.780 --> 04:01:48.140]   and Taiwan pays them money to recognize them and so forth.
[04:01:48.140 --> 04:01:50.100]   So I'm like, man, maybe we can convince Tuvalu
[04:01:50.100 --> 04:01:51.700]   to do something with crypto.
[04:01:51.700 --> 04:01:53.460]   And that didn't work out so well.
[04:01:53.460 --> 04:01:56.460]   But now El Salvador is actually playing the game.
[04:01:56.460 --> 04:01:57.540]   And that's a real country.
[04:01:57.540 --> 04:02:00.100]   It's got like 5 million people and so forth.
[04:02:00.100 --> 04:02:01.980]   So we know the president's brother
[04:02:01.980 --> 04:02:03.780]   and we've had some conversations there.
[04:02:03.780 --> 04:02:05.620]   So maybe we'll go in the next few months
[04:02:05.620 --> 04:02:07.820]   and see what's going on there and do a state visit
[04:02:07.820 --> 04:02:09.180]   and talk to the president.
[04:02:09.180 --> 04:02:11.540]   But it's an interesting development.
[04:02:11.540 --> 04:02:14.240]   And it's one of those things that it can't quite be ignored
[04:02:14.240 --> 04:02:15.920]   'cause the nation state's doing it.
[04:02:15.920 --> 04:02:18.440]   On the other hand, you have to manage expectations.
[04:02:18.440 --> 04:02:21.040]   Is the central bank taking a position in Bitcoin?
[04:02:21.040 --> 04:02:24.800]   Are they actually switching over to a cryptocurrency
[04:02:24.800 --> 04:02:26.600]   as their unit of account?
[04:02:26.600 --> 04:02:28.280]   Are they now getting off of BIS
[04:02:28.280 --> 04:02:31.640]   and they're all using the settlement rails of central banks?
[04:02:31.640 --> 04:02:34.100]   Are they actually blockchaining the entire country
[04:02:34.100 --> 04:02:36.760]   and they have some broad, ambitious agenda
[04:02:36.760 --> 04:02:37.800]   to go and do all that?
[04:02:37.800 --> 04:02:38.840]   That remains to be seen.
[04:02:38.840 --> 04:02:40.640]   And so it really is a commitment there.
[04:02:40.640 --> 04:02:43.500]   The other thing is that if you're autocratic,
[04:02:43.500 --> 04:02:45.240]   these systems are not so good for you
[04:02:45.240 --> 04:02:47.180]   'cause the minute you adopt these types of systems,
[04:02:47.180 --> 04:02:49.540]   you're pushing a lot of power to the edges.
[04:02:49.540 --> 04:02:51.820]   So there's a world of difference between optics
[04:02:51.820 --> 04:02:53.380]   and actual commitment.
[04:02:53.380 --> 04:02:55.700]   And actual commitment is I'm prepared
[04:02:55.700 --> 04:02:58.940]   to accept the consequences that the state is going to lose
[04:02:58.940 --> 04:03:00.980]   a lot of power along the way.
[04:03:00.980 --> 04:03:02.940]   And the problem is it's not clear to me
[04:03:02.940 --> 04:03:05.580]   if some of these politicians who are pro-blockchain,
[04:03:05.580 --> 04:03:08.140]   and I'm not making a statement on El Salvador in particular,
[04:03:08.140 --> 04:03:09.660]   I'm just saying in general,
[04:03:09.660 --> 04:03:11.680]   are fully aware of that reality.
[04:03:11.680 --> 04:03:13.400]   A lot of them seem to think that somehow
[04:03:13.400 --> 04:03:16.100]   they can contain the blockchain genie in the bottle
[04:03:16.100 --> 04:03:17.620]   and blockchain their whole country,
[04:03:17.620 --> 04:03:19.780]   but stay president for life.
[04:03:19.780 --> 04:03:20.840]   That doesn't work.
[04:03:20.840 --> 04:03:23.660]   Once they have that power, they're gone.
[04:03:23.660 --> 04:03:24.880]   - So do you think once they realize
[04:03:24.880 --> 04:03:27.780]   that this is one of the failure cases,
[04:03:27.780 --> 04:03:29.380]   one of the things that people are concerned about
[04:03:29.380 --> 04:03:31.260]   is governments banning cryptocurrency?
[04:03:31.260 --> 04:03:32.520]   - Well, that's China case, right?
[04:03:32.520 --> 04:03:35.420]   They've started realizing this was a legitimate threat
[04:03:35.420 --> 04:03:37.900]   to capital controls and to the autocratic system
[04:03:37.900 --> 04:03:38.940]   that they've constructed there.
[04:03:38.940 --> 04:03:40.860]   And then suddenly China's starting to build
[04:03:40.860 --> 04:03:43.180]   its own People's Bank of China blockchain,
[04:03:43.180 --> 04:03:46.060]   and Bitcoin is now the red-headed stepchild.
[04:03:46.060 --> 04:03:47.060]   They didn't really care too much
[04:03:47.060 --> 04:03:48.140]   'cause it was great for corruption.
[04:03:48.140 --> 04:03:49.540]   You could evade capital controls
[04:03:49.540 --> 04:03:51.620]   and so all the well-connected people,
[04:03:51.620 --> 04:03:53.060]   they're like, "Oh yeah, Bitcoin's bad,"
[04:03:53.060 --> 04:03:54.660]   but then they'd have Bitcoin of their own
[04:03:54.660 --> 04:03:56.820]   and they could use it to send money around.
[04:03:56.820 --> 04:03:59.300]   But now the government's gotten very serious about it.
[04:03:59.300 --> 04:04:01.380]   They're saying like, "Okay, we want to control
[04:04:01.380 --> 04:04:02.780]   "and dominate this whole thing,
[04:04:02.780 --> 04:04:05.000]   "and it's a threat to our plan for the digital yuan
[04:04:05.000 --> 04:04:07.220]   "to become the world standard to displace the dollar."
[04:04:07.220 --> 04:04:09.140]   - But so the moment you have El Salvador
[04:04:09.140 --> 04:04:10.660]   and just more and more countries,
[04:04:10.660 --> 04:04:13.340]   say there'll be a country in Europe, for example,
[04:04:13.340 --> 04:04:18.340]   that accepts Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Cardano,
[04:04:18.340 --> 04:04:21.060]   the idea is it would put a lot of pressure on you.
[04:04:21.060 --> 04:04:23.220]   So there'll be like this kind of ripple effect
[04:04:23.220 --> 04:04:26.940]   and then the individual governments won't be able to help,
[04:04:26.940 --> 04:04:29.020]   and eventually there'll be a superpower
[04:04:29.020 --> 04:04:32.020]   like, I don't know, Russia or the United States
[04:04:32.020 --> 04:04:34.500]   and/or, I don't know, Canada.
[04:04:34.500 --> 04:04:38.460]   So do you see that sort of an inevitable trend
[04:04:38.460 --> 04:04:40.460]   where cryptocurrency takes over the world
[04:04:40.460 --> 04:04:46.020]   as a store of value and as a method of payments?
[04:04:46.020 --> 04:04:46.900]   - Yeah, probably.
[04:04:46.900 --> 04:04:48.820]   I mean, you can do just so much more
[04:04:48.820 --> 04:04:50.100]   with programmable finance.
[04:04:50.100 --> 04:04:51.900]   Transactions in general have five properties.
[04:04:51.900 --> 04:04:54.260]   You have the asset that runs on the rail.
[04:04:54.260 --> 04:04:55.700]   That's what we always think about.
[04:04:55.700 --> 04:04:56.980]   And you can transact that,
[04:04:56.980 --> 04:04:59.540]   and then you have the identity
[04:04:59.540 --> 04:05:01.980]   and you transact that either like one to one,
[04:05:01.980 --> 04:05:04.460]   one to many, many to one, or many to many.
[04:05:04.460 --> 04:05:05.380]   And then you have metadata.
[04:05:05.380 --> 04:05:07.140]   So that's the story of the transactions,
[04:05:07.140 --> 04:05:09.580]   like where did it take place, these types of things.
[04:05:09.580 --> 04:05:12.260]   And then you have the contractual relationship.
[04:05:12.260 --> 04:05:13.620]   So that's the smart contract component.
[04:05:13.620 --> 04:05:15.260]   And then you embed that within regulation.
[04:05:15.260 --> 04:05:18.260]   So transactions always live within jurisdictions.
[04:05:18.260 --> 04:05:19.700]   This is relevant to the conversation,
[04:05:19.700 --> 04:05:21.460]   will digital currencies take over?
[04:05:21.460 --> 04:05:25.780]   Because those things are right now done separately
[04:05:25.780 --> 04:05:27.940]   in a very fragmented and fractured way,
[04:05:27.940 --> 04:05:29.980]   and they're not completely globalized.
[04:05:29.980 --> 04:05:33.020]   And it's a super expensive to hoist up this entire system
[04:05:33.020 --> 04:05:35.220]   and automate things like compliance.
[04:05:35.220 --> 04:05:39.340]   It's usually a huge part of every bank's balance sheet.
[04:05:39.340 --> 04:05:42.300]   So when you look at the concept of a digital currency,
[04:05:42.300 --> 04:05:44.940]   you're saying all five of those things are programmable.
[04:05:44.940 --> 04:05:47.260]   And so they could be like library driven.
[04:05:47.260 --> 04:05:50.140]   You say, oh, I wanna be in compliance with Eritrea.
[04:05:50.140 --> 04:05:51.860]   Okay, pull up the Eritrean library.
[04:05:51.860 --> 04:05:54.460]   Now you are, it's built into the transaction.
[04:05:54.460 --> 04:05:56.740]   Previously, it's like, go hire some lawyers
[04:05:56.740 --> 04:05:58.740]   and go figure out the entire code
[04:05:58.740 --> 04:06:01.220]   and translate some things and rah, rah, rah.
[04:06:01.220 --> 04:06:02.780]   It's crazy.
[04:06:02.780 --> 04:06:07.500]   So just the orders of magnitude efficiency gains
[04:06:07.500 --> 04:06:10.180]   that you get and the increased liquidity you get
[04:06:10.180 --> 04:06:12.980]   and the fact that you can now represent all assets
[04:06:12.980 --> 04:06:15.700]   with a universal way, that financial stem cell,
[04:06:15.700 --> 04:06:18.660]   there's an inevitability to the victory of our industry.
[04:06:18.660 --> 04:06:21.260]   The challenge is how do we deal with this
[04:06:21.260 --> 04:06:23.180]   with the squabbling of superpowers?
[04:06:23.180 --> 04:06:25.780]   China wants to be the new world standard.
[04:06:25.780 --> 04:06:27.220]   America wants to preserve that.
[04:06:27.220 --> 04:06:29.160]   And the rest of the world is trying to figure out
[04:06:29.160 --> 04:06:30.140]   how do we create something
[04:06:30.140 --> 04:06:32.220]   that's a bit more fair and balanced?
[04:06:32.220 --> 04:06:35.380]   And so crypto comes in and it potentially is
[04:06:35.380 --> 04:06:38.060]   both an ally and a competitor to those desires.
[04:06:38.060 --> 04:06:40.140]   'Cause if you do too much crypto,
[04:06:40.140 --> 04:06:42.220]   you don't need a nation state anymore.
[04:06:42.220 --> 04:06:44.180]   If you do too little crypto, well,
[04:06:44.180 --> 04:06:45.820]   it's China or America.
[04:06:45.820 --> 04:06:47.860]   So what's that sweet spot?
[04:06:47.860 --> 04:06:52.340]   - Do you hope that in the process of cryptocurrency
[04:06:52.340 --> 04:06:55.420]   pushing power to the edges, to the people,
[04:06:55.420 --> 04:06:57.380]   that we would be able to alleviate
[04:06:57.380 --> 04:06:58.920]   some of the suffering in the world
[04:06:58.920 --> 04:07:01.660]   caused by centralized power and the abuses of power
[04:07:01.660 --> 04:07:03.340]   and corruption, all those kinds of things?
[04:07:03.340 --> 04:07:04.160]   - 100%.
[04:07:04.160 --> 04:07:06.020]   I made a very angry video months ago.
[04:07:06.020 --> 04:07:07.300]   (Lex laughing)
[04:07:07.300 --> 04:07:08.820]   I make angry videos.
[04:07:08.820 --> 04:07:10.020]   I should drink, Lex.
[04:07:10.020 --> 04:07:10.860]   I really should.
[04:07:10.860 --> 04:07:11.680]   (Lex laughing)
[04:07:11.680 --> 04:07:12.520]   - Maybe you should drink more.
[04:07:12.520 --> 04:07:13.360]   - Yeah, I know, right?
[04:07:13.360 --> 04:07:14.540]   It depends on who you ask.
[04:07:14.540 --> 04:07:15.700]   I made a video a little while.
[04:07:15.700 --> 04:07:17.980]   I said, you know, our industry is an industry of frustration.
[04:07:17.980 --> 04:07:21.100]   It exists because we weren't the industry
[04:07:21.100 --> 04:07:23.740]   that charged 85% interest to the poorest people
[04:07:23.740 --> 04:07:24.740]   in the world for loans.
[04:07:24.740 --> 04:07:27.820]   We weren't the industry that charged 15% to move money
[04:07:27.820 --> 04:07:31.180]   for a maid sending money home to mom in Manila.
[04:07:31.780 --> 04:07:33.140]   You know, we weren't the industry
[04:07:33.140 --> 04:07:35.220]   that laundered hundreds of billions of dollars
[04:07:35.220 --> 04:07:38.100]   of drug money and funded arms dealers in Africa
[04:07:38.100 --> 04:07:40.460]   and all these things or permitted oil for food
[04:07:40.460 --> 04:07:42.860]   to exist and so forth.
[04:07:42.860 --> 04:07:44.860]   And the people who did these things aren't in jail.
[04:07:44.860 --> 04:07:45.700]   They're rich.
[04:07:45.700 --> 04:07:46.520]   They're billionaires.
[04:07:46.520 --> 04:07:48.220]   They fly private jets.
[04:07:48.220 --> 04:07:51.540]   So our industry is the antidote to these types of things.
[04:07:51.540 --> 04:07:54.780]   We say, guys, we want a system that's fair.
[04:07:54.780 --> 04:07:56.260]   That's it.
[04:07:56.260 --> 04:07:58.960]   And we want everybody to be treated equally.
[04:07:58.960 --> 04:08:00.980]   That doesn't mean everybody's gonna win.
[04:08:00.980 --> 04:08:03.140]   It doesn't mean that when you lose, you know,
[04:08:03.140 --> 04:08:05.860]   somebody's gonna come on a white horse and bail you out.
[04:08:05.860 --> 04:08:08.060]   You're gonna have winners and losers, but it's fair.
[04:08:08.060 --> 04:08:09.020]   That's all we want.
[04:08:09.020 --> 04:08:10.600]   That's all we've ever wanted.
[04:08:10.600 --> 04:08:12.580]   There's no coincidence that Bitcoin was created
[04:08:12.580 --> 04:08:16.060]   right around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis.
[04:08:16.060 --> 04:08:17.880]   It's not like these were just unrelated events.
[04:08:17.880 --> 04:08:20.180]   They're highly correlated to each other, okay?
[04:08:20.180 --> 04:08:21.660]   I'd say perhaps even causal.
[04:08:21.660 --> 04:08:23.100]   Go figure.
[04:08:23.100 --> 04:08:26.020]   And everything we've done as an industry
[04:08:26.020 --> 04:08:28.740]   from that moment to today and beyond
[04:08:28.740 --> 04:08:32.740]   has been about that endless, relentless desire
[04:08:32.740 --> 04:08:35.380]   to make things a little bit less corrupt,
[04:08:35.380 --> 04:08:38.900]   a little bit less nepotistic, and a bit more open.
[04:08:38.900 --> 04:08:41.980]   And it's gotten so insane
[04:08:41.980 --> 04:08:44.340]   that you have these things in Wyoming called speedy banks,
[04:08:44.340 --> 04:08:45.640]   where you're full reserve banks.
[04:08:45.640 --> 04:08:49.720]   They have 100% of their balance sheet is accounted for.
[04:08:49.720 --> 04:08:51.060]   They don't lend.
[04:08:51.060 --> 04:08:53.560]   And then you have the people in the banking community saying,
[04:08:53.560 --> 04:08:55.260]   well, those are a risk to banking.
[04:08:56.220 --> 04:08:59.660]   We're scared that these speedy banks are gonna default.
[04:08:59.660 --> 04:09:02.220]   It's like, what world are you living in?
[04:09:02.220 --> 04:09:03.460]   You have fractional reserve,
[04:09:03.460 --> 04:09:06.240]   sometimes like 2% assets on the balance sheet,
[04:09:06.240 --> 04:09:07.620]   and then you're worried that the guys
[04:09:07.620 --> 04:09:09.540]   who actually have a dollar for every dollar
[04:09:09.540 --> 04:09:12.500]   they say they have are the ones that are gonna collapse.
[04:09:12.500 --> 04:09:15.060]   It's like the 1984 level doublespeak
[04:09:15.060 --> 04:09:17.060]   when you see the system and negative interest rates
[04:09:17.060 --> 04:09:17.940]   and all these other things.
[04:09:17.940 --> 04:09:20.820]   And so I absolutely believe the direction and course
[04:09:20.820 --> 04:09:24.180]   of this industry is to make things more honest and fair,
[04:09:24.180 --> 04:09:26.460]   and also by its very existence,
[04:09:26.460 --> 04:09:30.460]   it exposes double standards, hypocrisy, and corruption.
[04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:32.160]   Just the fact that it's there,
[04:09:32.160 --> 04:09:33.940]   because it's one thing to say that,
[04:09:33.940 --> 04:09:35.900]   well, it just can't be because of the nature
[04:09:35.900 --> 04:09:36.740]   of global finance.
[04:09:36.740 --> 04:09:38.380]   There's no way to do it otherwise.
[04:09:38.380 --> 04:09:41.740]   It's another thing to see it there as an example,
[04:09:41.740 --> 04:09:43.380]   and say, well, that thing is doing it.
[04:09:43.380 --> 04:09:45.300]   Why can't you guys be this way?
[04:09:45.300 --> 04:09:46.860]   That's why I'm so passionate about Africa,
[04:09:46.860 --> 04:09:48.780]   'cause they don't like the systems they have,
[04:09:48.780 --> 04:09:50.340]   and everybody's really young,
[04:09:50.340 --> 04:09:52.500]   and they are gonna throw all the systems out
[04:09:52.500 --> 04:09:53.520]   in the next 20 years,
[04:09:53.520 --> 04:09:55.460]   and they're gonna replace them with something else.
[04:09:55.460 --> 04:09:57.340]   If we get this stuff into Africa,
[04:09:57.340 --> 04:09:59.380]   1.2 billion people will be living
[04:09:59.380 --> 04:10:02.260]   in a considerably better system than the rest of the world.
[04:10:02.260 --> 04:10:03.860]   And then everybody else will look at that and say,
[04:10:03.860 --> 04:10:05.660]   why the hell are those guys so rich?
[04:10:05.660 --> 04:10:07.020]   Why are those guys making the money?
[04:10:07.020 --> 04:10:08.820]   Why are those guys doing so well?
[04:10:08.820 --> 04:10:10.060]   And it's not satisfying to hear,
[04:10:10.060 --> 04:10:13.320]   well, Africa's just better.
[04:10:13.320 --> 04:10:14.460]   No one's gonna say that.
[04:10:14.460 --> 04:10:16.300]   They're gonna say, okay, yeah,
[04:10:16.300 --> 04:10:19.180]   it's nepotism and corruption and lack of transparency
[04:10:19.180 --> 04:10:20.020]   and these types of things.
[04:10:20.020 --> 04:10:22.120]   So I think absolutely it has the potential
[04:10:22.120 --> 04:10:23.720]   to improve the human condition,
[04:10:23.720 --> 04:10:26.200]   but humans have to get out of the way.
[04:10:26.200 --> 04:10:29.020]   Humans have ingrained in themselves selfishness,
[04:10:29.020 --> 04:10:31.980]   and it is a desire to maximize for themselves
[04:10:31.980 --> 04:10:34.500]   and their family, and not think in systems.
[04:10:34.500 --> 04:10:38.180]   And so we have to evolve capitalism at the same time.
[04:10:38.180 --> 04:10:39.540]   And what I mean by that is right now,
[04:10:39.540 --> 04:10:41.200]   you're trying to maximize the amount
[04:10:41.200 --> 04:10:42.580]   of resources you get today.
[04:10:42.580 --> 04:10:44.600]   What we need to do is start thinking about
[04:10:44.600 --> 04:10:47.940]   how do we create future versions of ourselves in 2100
[04:10:47.940 --> 04:10:50.220]   and create a resource for that time period,
[04:10:50.220 --> 04:10:51.620]   and then the name of the game
[04:10:51.620 --> 04:10:54.380]   is to maximize that or balance that
[04:10:54.380 --> 04:10:55.780]   with what you get in the short term.
[04:10:55.780 --> 04:10:57.420]   And then suddenly you're saying to yourself,
[04:10:57.420 --> 04:11:00.140]   well, if I'm doing things that are good for me today,
[04:11:00.140 --> 04:11:02.740]   but compromising then, I make less money.
[04:11:02.740 --> 04:11:05.580]   So capitalism as an engine is okay.
[04:11:05.580 --> 04:11:07.580]   The problem is it's misparameterized.
[04:11:07.580 --> 04:11:10.060]   - Right, almost like inject long-term incentives
[04:11:10.060 --> 04:11:10.900]   into the capitalist system.
[04:11:10.900 --> 04:11:12.500]   - Exactly, and cryptocurrency space
[04:11:12.500 --> 04:11:15.640]   is the only economic system where that's actually possible.
[04:11:15.640 --> 04:11:17.220]   You can create a tokenomics scheme
[04:11:17.220 --> 04:11:19.180]   where doing things that are beneficial for people
[04:11:19.180 --> 04:11:21.700]   you'll never meet 'cause you're long dead
[04:11:21.700 --> 04:11:23.380]   actually makes you money today.
[04:11:23.380 --> 04:11:26.460]   You can't do that in a legacy financial system and so forth.
[04:11:26.460 --> 04:11:29.400]   So I think that that's the real impact capital conversation
[04:11:29.400 --> 04:11:32.060]   that has to be had as you explore these things
[04:11:32.060 --> 04:11:34.020]   is you have to talk to people and say,
[04:11:34.020 --> 04:11:35.540]   look, it's not about communism
[04:11:35.540 --> 04:11:37.540]   or socialism versus capitalism.
[04:11:37.540 --> 04:11:40.500]   It's not about, hey, let's donate and save the world
[04:11:40.500 --> 04:11:43.120]   or try to be charity and make things better.
[04:11:43.120 --> 04:11:44.780]   It's all about how do you use the fact
[04:11:44.780 --> 04:11:48.140]   that we have a better toolkit to create a different system,
[04:11:48.140 --> 04:11:49.700]   a different incentive model,
[04:11:49.700 --> 04:11:51.700]   where the default configuration of the system
[04:11:51.700 --> 04:11:53.140]   is long-term thinking.
[04:11:53.140 --> 04:11:54.700]   And the default consideration of the system
[04:11:54.700 --> 04:11:56.620]   is get rid of all these negative externalities
[04:11:56.620 --> 04:11:59.900]   that marketplaces have and judge the success of society
[04:11:59.900 --> 04:12:02.420]   not by how the greatest of society are doing
[04:12:02.420 --> 04:12:04.660]   but by how the least of society are doing.
[04:12:04.660 --> 04:12:07.180]   You know, HDI, not GDP, this kind of thinking.
[04:12:07.180 --> 04:12:09.860]   And I think crypto can actually be the vanguard
[04:12:09.860 --> 04:12:10.700]   that kind of pushes us there.
[04:12:10.700 --> 04:12:12.900]   And the first countries to adopt that
[04:12:12.900 --> 04:12:16.020]   are gonna be just significantly better places to live.
[04:12:16.020 --> 04:12:17.260]   And the people who envy them
[04:12:17.260 --> 04:12:19.140]   will force the other countries to change.
[04:12:19.140 --> 04:12:20.020]   - That'd be a ripple effect.
[04:12:20.020 --> 04:12:21.620]   So when you wake up in the morning
[04:12:21.620 --> 04:12:23.120]   or as you sleep like a baby,
[04:12:23.120 --> 04:12:25.620]   wake up multiple times in the middle of the night,
[04:12:25.620 --> 04:12:31.660]   do you feel the burden of this kind of future
[04:12:31.660 --> 04:12:34.460]   that's in your hands and not to mess it up?
[04:12:34.460 --> 04:12:36.380]   Like, what is it, Big Lebowski?
[04:12:36.380 --> 04:12:38.680]   Her life is in your hands, dude.
[04:12:38.680 --> 04:12:41.060]   (both laughing)
[04:12:41.060 --> 04:12:42.980]   - Don't worry about them, they're nihilists, Donny.
[04:12:42.980 --> 04:12:45.420]   (both laughing)
[04:12:45.420 --> 04:12:46.780]   - Do you feel the burden of like,
[04:12:46.780 --> 04:12:49.500]   'cause we're talking about all these 100 plus papers
[04:12:49.500 --> 04:12:52.180]   and the academic beauty of the algorithms
[04:12:52.180 --> 04:12:53.940]   we're talking about, but then there's millions
[04:12:53.940 --> 04:12:55.420]   of human lives at stake here.
[04:12:55.420 --> 04:12:57.900]   - I mean, you always feel the burden,
[04:12:57.900 --> 04:12:59.060]   especially in my own company.
[04:12:59.060 --> 04:13:00.660]   I mean, I have all these people who work for me
[04:13:00.660 --> 04:13:03.220]   and they eat because I pay them, right?
[04:13:03.220 --> 04:13:06.300]   So if I can't pay them, then that's my fault.
[04:13:06.300 --> 04:13:09.340]   So you have to, as a leader,
[04:13:09.340 --> 04:13:10.600]   you always have to be cognizant
[04:13:10.600 --> 04:13:12.060]   that there's all these people who've signed up
[04:13:12.060 --> 04:13:13.540]   for your crazy vision,
[04:13:13.540 --> 04:13:15.740]   and you have to be larger than life.
[04:13:15.740 --> 04:13:18.260]   You always have to be good.
[04:13:18.260 --> 04:13:20.460]   You're not allowed to have a bad day.
[04:13:20.460 --> 04:13:21.780]   You're not allowed to feel like shit.
[04:13:21.780 --> 04:13:23.080]   You always have to show up.
[04:13:23.080 --> 04:13:24.980]   You always have to be pushing forward.
[04:13:24.980 --> 04:13:28.080]   And so that's a huge burden in many respects,
[04:13:28.080 --> 04:13:29.540]   'cause there's Charles the person,
[04:13:29.540 --> 04:13:31.860]   and then Charles the CEO,
[04:13:31.860 --> 04:13:33.620]   and these are very different things
[04:13:33.620 --> 04:13:37.180]   in terms of expectations, at the very least.
[04:13:37.180 --> 04:13:39.900]   And so it's heavy in that respect.
[04:13:39.900 --> 04:13:41.460]   That said, what gives you solace
[04:13:41.460 --> 04:13:43.540]   is that you're not in it alone.
[04:13:43.540 --> 04:13:45.240]   It's lonely, but you're not alone.
[04:13:45.240 --> 04:13:47.700]   You have so many amazing people around you
[04:13:47.700 --> 04:13:48.700]   that are willing to help
[04:13:48.700 --> 04:13:50.060]   and actually take some of that burden.
[04:13:50.060 --> 04:13:53.220]   And my life has gotten considerably better
[04:13:53.220 --> 04:13:55.680]   when I learned how to delegate and trust,
[04:13:55.680 --> 04:13:57.940]   and even if people screw up and fail,
[04:13:57.940 --> 04:13:59.920]   it's worth the risk,
[04:13:59.920 --> 04:14:02.360]   'cause ultimately you're amplifying yourself.
[04:14:02.360 --> 04:14:06.140]   The other thing is that it's okay not to get all the way.
[04:14:06.140 --> 04:14:07.820]   You want to, you wanna push there,
[04:14:07.820 --> 04:14:10.180]   but make sure whatever the hell you do,
[04:14:10.180 --> 04:14:11.980]   you leave something for somebody else
[04:14:11.980 --> 04:14:13.860]   to pick up and carry on.
[04:14:13.860 --> 04:14:16.880]   That's why we care so much about the publication process
[04:14:16.880 --> 04:14:19.360]   and open source, 'cause we'll never file a patent
[04:14:19.360 --> 04:14:20.480]   in our entire history,
[04:14:20.480 --> 04:14:23.820]   'cause whatever we do, it's yours as much as it is mine.
[04:14:23.820 --> 04:14:26.280]   And maybe I can only get you 70% of the way,
[04:14:26.280 --> 04:14:28.220]   and I'll plop over dead from a heart attack
[04:14:28.220 --> 04:14:30.600]   or get killed by an eagle or something like that.
[04:14:30.600 --> 04:14:32.440]   Maybe somebody brings the-- - Eagle?
[04:14:32.440 --> 04:14:34.240]   - Maybe somebody brings the Hasteagle back
[04:14:34.240 --> 04:14:35.200]   and it kills me, you know?
[04:14:35.200 --> 04:14:36.280]   So it could happen.
[04:14:36.280 --> 04:14:37.600]   They're bringing the woolly mammoth back.
[04:14:37.600 --> 04:14:39.880]   Talk to George Church about that.
[04:14:39.880 --> 04:14:40.720]   - It's a good way to go. - Yeah, I know.
[04:14:40.720 --> 04:14:42.680]   - Either the eagle or the mammoth.
[04:14:42.680 --> 04:14:44.080]   I'd rather be crushed by a mammoth,
[04:14:44.080 --> 04:14:47.180]   'cause eagles actually fly you up and drop you.
[04:14:47.180 --> 04:14:48.020]   - Oh, so you won't die.
[04:14:48.020 --> 04:14:49.960]   It'll be a slow death and they'll probably peck at you.
[04:14:49.960 --> 04:14:52.720]   - Exactly, you'll just be grievously wounded on the ground
[04:14:52.720 --> 04:14:55.080]   and the eagle's slowly devouring you.
[04:14:55.080 --> 04:14:56.800]   Yeah, don't go down that way.
[04:14:56.800 --> 04:14:57.880]   I've lost my train of thought.
[04:14:57.880 --> 04:15:01.020]   (both laughing)
[04:15:01.020 --> 04:15:03.320]   - The point is you feel deeply grateful
[04:15:03.320 --> 04:15:04.160]   there's a bunch of people around you.
[04:15:04.160 --> 04:15:06.280]   - Yeah, there we go. - And then you give--
[04:15:06.280 --> 04:15:07.800]   - Yeah, you delegate, you delegate.
[04:15:07.800 --> 04:15:09.600]   And somebody fights the eagle
[04:15:09.600 --> 04:15:11.560]   and another people takes care of that and this, that,
[04:15:11.560 --> 04:15:13.240]   and the other, you just do the best you can.
[04:15:13.240 --> 04:15:15.240]   You're in the arena, you fight as hard as you can.
[04:15:15.240 --> 04:15:19.120]   You leave nothing for home.
[04:15:19.120 --> 04:15:20.720]   You put it all on the field.
[04:15:20.720 --> 04:15:22.360]   And then when you go home, you have pride
[04:15:22.360 --> 04:15:23.960]   in what you've done and you know
[04:15:23.960 --> 04:15:26.000]   that you've at least made a slight difference.
[04:15:26.000 --> 04:15:28.280]   You know, one person can make a huge difference.
[04:15:28.280 --> 04:15:30.240]   Look at Norman Borlaug.
[04:15:30.240 --> 04:15:31.400]   I mean, just went around the whole world
[04:15:31.400 --> 04:15:32.920]   teaching people how to grow crops.
[04:15:32.920 --> 04:15:35.560]   He saved a billion lives over the course of his life.
[04:15:35.560 --> 04:15:38.720]   Billion people didn't starve to death because of one guy.
[04:15:38.720 --> 04:15:40.920]   It's amazing the asymmetry and the returns
[04:15:40.920 --> 04:15:41.760]   on that type of a thing,
[04:15:41.760 --> 04:15:44.080]   just for the knowledge transfer of all things.
[04:15:44.080 --> 04:15:46.080]   And yet, not a household name.
[04:15:46.080 --> 04:15:48.880]   So that's the other side of it, of the burdens.
[04:15:48.880 --> 04:15:51.560]   You know, people always want something for something.
[04:15:51.560 --> 04:15:53.240]   So they say, oh, if I endure all these burdens,
[04:15:53.240 --> 04:15:54.720]   I should be given something.
[04:15:54.720 --> 04:15:57.120]   I entered into this space fully expecting
[04:15:57.120 --> 04:16:00.320]   that probably the most likely outcome was jail.
[04:16:00.320 --> 04:16:02.480]   That's what my dad told me and other people told me.
[04:16:02.480 --> 04:16:04.880]   And it was because it's like, look at where we came from.
[04:16:04.880 --> 04:16:07.040]   The Liberty Dollar, Eagle, all these things.
[04:16:07.040 --> 04:16:09.520]   Anybody tries to innovate the monetary system,
[04:16:09.520 --> 04:16:12.040]   they either end up like Gaddafi or they end up in prison
[04:16:12.040 --> 04:16:15.080]   or they end up like nepotistic or a banker
[04:16:15.080 --> 04:16:16.480]   or something like that.
[04:16:16.480 --> 04:16:19.760]   And so, you know, the financial regulations
[04:16:19.760 --> 04:16:22.280]   are not built for rapid innovation.
[04:16:22.280 --> 04:16:24.040]   They're not built for Bitcoin.
[04:16:24.040 --> 04:16:26.040]   There's a reason Satoshi was anonymous.
[04:16:26.040 --> 04:16:28.480]   It wasn't 'cause he enjoyed the anonymity.
[04:16:28.480 --> 04:16:30.840]   There was legitimate criminal risk
[04:16:30.840 --> 04:16:32.360]   for this type of activity.
[04:16:32.360 --> 04:16:34.320]   So the fact that I've gotten this far
[04:16:34.320 --> 04:16:37.000]   and I'm doing pretty good, that's a win.
[04:16:37.000 --> 04:16:38.000]   You know, you take that.
[04:16:38.000 --> 04:16:38.960]   Life is good.
[04:16:39.960 --> 04:16:41.160]   - What is a productive day
[04:16:41.160 --> 04:16:43.720]   in the life of Charles Hoskinson look like?
[04:16:43.720 --> 04:16:46.040]   Now we're getting to the details here.
[04:16:46.040 --> 04:16:49.320]   Diet, like fasting or not, maybe.
[04:16:49.320 --> 04:16:54.120]   Coffee, non-coffee, exercise, sleep,
[04:16:54.120 --> 04:16:57.600]   scheduling, like periods of deep work, programming.
[04:16:57.600 --> 04:16:59.840]   Then the social media stuff that you do.
[04:16:59.840 --> 04:17:01.600]   You clearly enjoy being on social media
[04:17:01.600 --> 04:17:04.280]   and also live streaming, educating, inspiring the world
[04:17:04.280 --> 04:17:07.880]   or getting drunk and ranting at the computer.
[04:17:07.880 --> 04:17:10.240]   - Well, first off, you do a wet year and a dry year.
[04:17:10.240 --> 04:17:12.360]   That's what prevents you from becoming an alcoholic.
[04:17:12.360 --> 04:17:14.960]   So unfortunately, the way that schedule worked,
[04:17:14.960 --> 04:17:17.000]   2020 was my dry year.
[04:17:17.000 --> 04:17:18.760]   Like I didn't drink the entire year.
[04:17:18.760 --> 04:17:20.160]   Not a single sip of alcohol.
[04:17:20.160 --> 04:17:21.440]   It was the worst. - On purpose.
[04:17:21.440 --> 04:17:23.560]   - Yeah, you do a dry year and then you do a wet year.
[04:17:23.560 --> 04:17:26.240]   - Oh, so this is one of your ideas about life
[04:17:26.240 --> 04:17:27.280]   is you alternate.
[04:17:27.280 --> 04:17:28.720]   - Yeah, you have to alternate.
[04:17:28.720 --> 04:17:30.440]   Never do too much of any one thing.
[04:17:30.440 --> 04:17:31.680]   - Well, Churchill never alternated.
[04:17:31.680 --> 04:17:32.960]   He just kept drinking throughout his life.
[04:17:32.960 --> 04:17:33.800]   He did pretty good.
[04:17:33.800 --> 04:17:34.920]   (Luke laughs)
[04:17:35.720 --> 04:17:37.800]   Just to push back against you.
[04:17:37.800 --> 04:17:39.400]   - Yeah, him and Alfred North Whitehead.
[04:17:39.400 --> 04:17:41.000]   Although, didn't Churchill get kicked out
[04:17:41.000 --> 04:17:42.240]   as prime minister at some point?
[04:17:42.240 --> 04:17:44.120]   - So maybe he took one dry year.
[04:17:44.120 --> 04:17:47.120]   - Yeah, he was a sober, happy, in shape Churchill.
[04:17:47.120 --> 04:17:49.120]   He would have led Britain for 30 fucking years.
[04:17:49.120 --> 04:17:51.400]   (Luke laughs)
[04:17:51.400 --> 04:17:55.080]   See, Lex, that's why we can't have nice things.
[04:17:55.080 --> 04:17:57.000]   - Conor S. Thompson, maybe you're onto something.
[04:17:57.000 --> 04:17:58.960]   - Oh, you know, it's really crazy if you go to Aspen
[04:17:58.960 --> 04:18:00.840]   and see the bar he used to go to.
[04:18:00.840 --> 04:18:02.680]   I actually met a waitress who knew him really well
[04:18:02.680 --> 04:18:05.360]   and he'd go in there like two, three times a day.
[04:18:05.360 --> 04:18:07.160]   And she's like, "Yeah, he'd do cocaine
[04:18:07.160 --> 04:18:08.260]   "right here on the table."
[04:18:08.260 --> 04:18:10.280]   And he'd come in with lots of pills
[04:18:10.280 --> 04:18:12.320]   and just put them all out on the table
[04:18:12.320 --> 04:18:13.880]   and be taking them at different hours.
[04:18:13.880 --> 04:18:15.760]   And they were all clearly illegal substances.
[04:18:15.760 --> 04:18:18.320]   But we'd just give him coffee or whatever he wanted.
[04:18:18.320 --> 04:18:19.340]   He's a great guy.
[04:18:19.340 --> 04:18:20.800]   But anyway, that's the day in the life of Charles.
[04:18:20.800 --> 04:18:21.620]   I fast.
[04:18:21.620 --> 04:18:23.920]   I tried to do intermittent fasting, 16/8.
[04:18:23.920 --> 04:18:26.200]   The longest fast I ever did for a long-term fast
[04:18:26.200 --> 04:18:28.120]   was two weeks, which was just crazy.
[04:18:28.120 --> 04:18:28.960]   - Wow.
[04:18:28.960 --> 04:18:30.200]   - Oh my God, I was--
[04:18:30.200 --> 04:18:33.160]   Can you take me through the journey of philosophically
[04:18:33.160 --> 04:18:34.720]   what was going on in your mind?
[04:18:34.720 --> 04:18:37.120]   - Well, so normally when I do an extended fast,
[04:18:37.120 --> 04:18:38.680]   it's about three, four days,
[04:18:38.680 --> 04:18:39.880]   'cause that's the sweet spot
[04:18:39.880 --> 04:18:41.540]   before you start losing muscle mass
[04:18:41.540 --> 04:18:42.840]   and other things start happening.
[04:18:42.840 --> 04:18:45.780]   And people know so much more about this than I do.
[04:18:45.780 --> 04:18:47.060]   But I just feel pretty good.
[04:18:47.060 --> 04:18:49.320]   And you kind of get addicted to the fast high.
[04:18:49.320 --> 04:18:50.520]   You don't have to eat.
[04:18:50.520 --> 04:18:52.240]   You have no downtime.
[04:18:52.240 --> 04:18:53.400]   You're just going.
[04:18:53.400 --> 04:18:54.640]   Your energy never dips.
[04:18:54.640 --> 04:18:58.180]   And so I used to do three, five days.
[04:18:58.180 --> 04:19:00.780]   Maybe three, four was the sweet spot.
[04:19:00.780 --> 04:19:02.620]   But then after about a week, I was like,
[04:19:02.620 --> 04:19:04.500]   how long can I make this go?
[04:19:04.500 --> 04:19:05.740]   And so I started talking to some people.
[04:19:05.740 --> 04:19:09.840]   They said, well, Angus Barber did 384 days.
[04:19:09.840 --> 04:19:11.220]   Of course, I'm not as fat as Angus.
[04:19:11.220 --> 04:19:13.060]   So I said, oh, I can do two weeks.
[04:19:13.060 --> 04:19:15.420]   So I just kept going and kept going and kept going
[04:19:15.420 --> 04:19:16.260]   and kept going.
[04:19:16.260 --> 04:19:19.220]   And right around the two-week mark,
[04:19:19.220 --> 04:19:21.620]   I fainted for a little bit in a chair.
[04:19:21.620 --> 04:19:24.900]   And I was like, okay, maybe I should start eating again.
[04:19:24.900 --> 04:19:26.140]   But then I was legitimately worried
[04:19:26.140 --> 04:19:28.020]   about refeeding syndrome and this stuff.
[04:19:28.020 --> 04:19:30.020]   Like, okay, how do I take care of that?
[04:19:30.020 --> 04:19:32.180]   So my brother's a doctor and I called him and I said,
[04:19:32.180 --> 04:19:34.340]   hey, Willie, I haven't eaten in two weeks.
[04:19:34.340 --> 04:19:36.460]   How do I start eating again?
[04:19:36.460 --> 04:19:37.820]   And he's like, what?
[04:19:37.820 --> 04:19:40.020]   (laughing)
[04:19:40.020 --> 04:19:40.860]   - Slowly.
[04:19:40.860 --> 04:19:41.680]   - Slowly, yeah.
[04:19:41.680 --> 04:19:43.780]   So in the usual routine, intermittent fasting,
[04:19:43.780 --> 04:19:46.040]   although I haven't been as good about it as I should be
[04:19:46.040 --> 04:19:48.740]   and I used to work out, I don't do as much as that,
[04:19:48.740 --> 04:19:52.780]   the stress and the work-life balance has been horrible
[04:19:52.780 --> 04:19:53.940]   the last 24 months.
[04:19:53.940 --> 04:19:55.940]   And I've gained a lot of weight and all that stuff.
[04:19:55.940 --> 04:19:57.060]   But I'll fix that.
[04:19:57.060 --> 04:19:58.180]   But I do try a lot of things.
[04:19:58.180 --> 04:20:00.300]   Like I use the Calm app and I do meditation.
[04:20:00.300 --> 04:20:02.740]   Recently I started doing photo biomodulation.
[04:20:02.740 --> 04:20:03.660]   You ever heard of that?
[04:20:03.660 --> 04:20:04.500]   - No.
[04:20:04.500 --> 04:20:06.020]   - It's a crazy headset called a V-Light.
[04:20:06.020 --> 04:20:08.120]   You saw that picture of me with like the weird thing
[04:20:08.120 --> 04:20:09.420]   with the red lights on?
[04:20:09.420 --> 04:20:10.940]   Actually, it shoots lights into your brain.
[04:20:10.940 --> 04:20:12.220]   It's really cool stuff.
[04:20:12.220 --> 04:20:13.260]   But it improves blood flow.
[04:20:13.260 --> 04:20:15.340]   And actually, there's some peer-reviewed studies
[04:20:15.340 --> 04:20:17.260]   that show that it does neurogenesis.
[04:20:17.260 --> 04:20:19.900]   So you actually generate new neurons and things like that.
[04:20:19.900 --> 04:20:21.220]   It's really cool stuff.
[04:20:21.220 --> 04:20:24.020]   So I do that and it actually helps a lot.
[04:20:24.020 --> 04:20:26.180]   And every day's a little different.
[04:20:26.180 --> 04:20:31.340]   - Do you get a few hours of alone time to work, to think?
[04:20:31.340 --> 04:20:33.640]   - Yeah, deep work is so important.
[04:20:33.640 --> 04:20:36.820]   There's even a book on that, like Deep Work.
[04:20:36.820 --> 04:20:38.100]   - Yeah, by Cal Newport.
[04:20:38.100 --> 04:20:39.220]   - I think you interviewed him, didn't you?
[04:20:39.220 --> 04:20:41.540]   - Yeah, everyone should listen to his podcast,
[04:20:41.540 --> 04:20:43.340]   Deep Questions, he's awesome.
[04:20:43.340 --> 04:20:46.780]   He's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist.
[04:20:46.780 --> 04:20:49.540]   So those guys really need their time alone to really think.
[04:20:49.540 --> 04:20:51.340]   - That's the one thing I deeply miss.
[04:20:51.340 --> 04:20:54.860]   When you're a CEO, you're the master of the five-minute deal.
[04:20:54.860 --> 04:20:57.180]   You come in, you talk to people, you make a decision,
[04:20:57.180 --> 04:20:59.020]   you move on to the next thing, you move on to the next thing.
[04:20:59.020 --> 04:21:01.280]   And I used to be used to really deep focus.
[04:21:01.280 --> 04:21:02.700]   You'd sit down and think about something
[04:21:02.700 --> 04:21:05.080]   for 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours.
[04:21:05.080 --> 04:21:05.920]   And that's that.
[04:21:05.920 --> 04:21:06.740]   And I enjoyed it.
[04:21:06.740 --> 04:21:09.820]   It was just so beautiful to get lost into something
[04:21:09.820 --> 04:21:11.820]   and just go and go and go.
[04:21:11.820 --> 04:21:13.060]   And then you become a CEO,
[04:21:13.060 --> 04:21:14.380]   and it's like you never can go and go.
[04:21:14.380 --> 04:21:16.380]   You're lucky if you read a four-page thing
[04:21:16.380 --> 04:21:18.140]   'cause there's something else that comes up.
[04:21:18.140 --> 04:21:19.760]   You have to travel, you have to do that.
[04:21:19.760 --> 04:21:21.620]   So I've been trying lately to have,
[04:21:21.620 --> 04:21:23.740]   and actually our chief of staff recommended,
[04:21:23.740 --> 04:21:26.220]   it's like Fridays is Do Not Disturb Day.
[04:21:26.220 --> 04:21:27.860]   So it's for deep work.
[04:21:27.860 --> 04:21:29.700]   You don't have meetings, any of these things.
[04:21:29.700 --> 04:21:32.040]   And so far I have not committed to that,
[04:21:32.040 --> 04:21:33.340]   but everybody else in the organization
[04:21:33.340 --> 04:21:34.220]   has started to move there.
[04:21:34.220 --> 04:21:35.660]   But my hope is next month
[04:21:35.660 --> 04:21:37.580]   that I can actually get serious about that.
[04:21:37.580 --> 04:21:39.260]   The other time I'm lost in thought is
[04:21:39.260 --> 04:21:40.740]   I do a lot of float tanks.
[04:21:40.740 --> 04:21:42.380]   Have you ever done isolation tanks?
[04:21:42.380 --> 04:21:43.820]   - But I really want to.
[04:21:43.820 --> 04:21:46.260]   - It's one of the most amazing things you can do.
[04:21:46.260 --> 04:21:48.020]   You come out on the other side,
[04:21:48.020 --> 04:21:51.220]   and all your stress worries, they're just gone.
[04:21:51.220 --> 04:21:53.860]   And you have so much productivity and clarity.
[04:21:53.860 --> 04:21:57.140]   If you combine that with daily naps, that's the way to go.
[04:21:57.140 --> 04:21:58.540]   - Yeah, I'm a huge fan of naps.
[04:21:58.540 --> 04:22:01.520]   So what about the social media stuff
[04:22:01.520 --> 04:22:04.540]   and you doing the live streams?
[04:22:04.540 --> 04:22:06.660]   Do you ever dread those?
[04:22:06.660 --> 04:22:08.980]   Are you energized by those?
[04:22:08.980 --> 04:22:10.300]   Because you're exceptionally good
[04:22:10.300 --> 04:22:12.260]   at communicating all the different kinds of ideas
[04:22:12.260 --> 04:22:13.980]   and being very transparent with the community,
[04:22:13.980 --> 04:22:14.820]   all those kinds of things.
[04:22:14.820 --> 04:22:16.820]   - I really enjoy the live streams.
[04:22:16.820 --> 04:22:20.540]   It's fun, it's never been a chore, because it's for them.
[04:22:20.540 --> 04:22:22.220]   It's a chance for people in the community
[04:22:22.220 --> 04:22:23.580]   who've been loyal, and they really love it,
[04:22:23.580 --> 04:22:25.580]   to actually just be there, ask some questions.
[04:22:25.580 --> 04:22:28.300]   And I try to make it as entertaining as possible.
[04:22:28.300 --> 04:22:32.140]   And you have your trolls, and you have your love.
[04:22:32.140 --> 04:22:34.700]   And it's actually nice to have a mixture of the two,
[04:22:34.700 --> 04:22:37.060]   'cause sometimes you can beat down trolls just for fun.
[04:22:37.060 --> 04:22:37.940]   You know, that kind of stuff.
[04:22:37.940 --> 04:22:40.460]   And it's grown to a cult following.
[04:22:40.460 --> 04:22:42.500]   I think there's like 40, 50,000 people.
[04:22:42.500 --> 04:22:45.380]   And it's almost like Fight Club in a certain respect.
[04:22:45.380 --> 04:22:47.420]   So I was in Vancouver years ago,
[04:22:47.420 --> 04:22:49.340]   and I was at Air Canada checking in,
[04:22:49.340 --> 04:22:50.940]   just about to fly back to Colorado.
[04:22:50.940 --> 04:22:52.580]   And I was getting this weird vibe
[04:22:52.580 --> 04:22:53.980]   from the guy that was checking me in.
[04:22:53.980 --> 04:22:55.980]   And then right after he takes my bag,
[04:22:55.980 --> 04:22:59.060]   he kind of leans over to me, he's like, "I love ADA."
[04:22:59.060 --> 04:23:00.300]   You know, and I was like, "Really?"
[04:23:00.300 --> 04:23:02.500]   He's like, "Yeah, I watch your live streams."
[04:23:02.500 --> 04:23:04.020]   And then I was flying into London.
[04:23:04.020 --> 04:23:05.460]   I was at London Heathrow Airport,
[04:23:05.460 --> 04:23:07.300]   and the passport control guy was there.
[04:23:07.300 --> 04:23:09.100]   And I was just about to take my passport out,
[04:23:09.100 --> 04:23:11.420]   and he says, "Welcome to London, Mr. Hoskinson."
[04:23:11.420 --> 04:23:13.140]   (Luke laughs)
[04:23:13.140 --> 04:23:15.060]   I was like, "Oh God, am I going to jail in London?
[04:23:15.060 --> 04:23:17.460]   "Why does the border patrol guy know who I am?
[04:23:17.460 --> 04:23:19.380]   "This is a bad deal for me."
[04:23:19.380 --> 04:23:22.020]   And it turned out he watched my live streams.
[04:23:22.020 --> 04:23:25.740]   And so there's a lot of that, and that's so much fun.
[04:23:25.740 --> 04:23:27.140]   In fact, here in Austin,
[04:23:27.140 --> 04:23:29.040]   there's a Mexican restaurant just down,
[04:23:29.040 --> 04:23:31.380]   close to this place.
[04:23:31.380 --> 04:23:32.340]   And while eating there,
[04:23:32.340 --> 04:23:33.940]   two different people recognized me,
[04:23:33.940 --> 04:23:35.380]   and I took a picture with one of them.
[04:23:35.380 --> 04:23:37.260]   And again, they watched the live streams.
[04:23:37.260 --> 04:23:38.540]   So that's-- - Well, if it's anything
[04:23:38.540 --> 04:23:39.940]   like Fight Club, you have to wonder
[04:23:39.940 --> 04:23:41.520]   if some of those people or all of them
[04:23:41.520 --> 04:23:43.500]   are just figments of your imagination.
[04:23:43.500 --> 04:23:46.180]   - Right, I would, (laughs)
[04:23:46.180 --> 04:23:47.780]   I don't have an answer for that.
[04:23:47.780 --> 04:23:51.180]   - I could be a figment of your imagination,
[04:23:51.180 --> 04:23:52.020]   which just proves that you're insane.
[04:23:52.020 --> 04:23:52.860]   - Yeah, but honestly,
[04:23:52.860 --> 04:23:54.660]   if I was capable of that level of delusion,
[04:23:54.660 --> 04:23:56.380]   why the hell don't I look like Brad Pitt?
[04:23:56.380 --> 04:23:57.220]   - Good point.
[04:23:57.220 --> 04:24:01.100]   Okay, so on this topic, let me ask you about mushrooms.
[04:24:01.100 --> 04:24:05.580]   You're interested in mushrooms, growing mushrooms.
[04:24:05.580 --> 04:24:08.260]   I believe you are also interested
[04:24:08.260 --> 04:24:11.300]   in the mind-expanding capabilities of psychedelics.
[04:24:11.300 --> 04:24:14.260]   At least you mentioned kind of the interesting place
[04:24:14.260 --> 04:24:17.500]   where your interest in non-psychedelic mushrooms might go.
[04:24:17.500 --> 04:24:21.100]   Can you explain the nature of your interest in mushrooms?
[04:24:21.100 --> 04:24:24.140]   Is it personal, is it business, is it both?
[04:24:24.140 --> 04:24:25.780]   - Well, it's a little bit of everything.
[04:24:25.780 --> 04:24:29.900]   It's just an underexplored area of science and botany
[04:24:29.900 --> 04:24:31.180]   that ought to be explored,
[04:24:31.180 --> 04:24:34.580]   because there's so much cool, interesting stuff there.
[04:24:34.580 --> 04:24:37.320]   Mushrooms do so much.
[04:24:37.320 --> 04:24:39.380]   Like, they have these things called cordyceps,
[04:24:39.380 --> 04:24:43.700]   and they are like a zombie fungus that infects insects,
[04:24:43.700 --> 04:24:46.340]   takes them over, and then it will have them
[04:24:46.340 --> 04:24:47.740]   kind of get to other insects,
[04:24:47.740 --> 04:24:50.180]   and then burst out of their head like an alien,
[04:24:50.180 --> 04:24:52.260]   and spray spores on them, and repeat the process.
[04:24:52.260 --> 04:24:53.900]   I mean, they even made a damn game about this,
[04:24:53.900 --> 04:24:55.820]   The Last of Us, or something like that.
[04:24:55.820 --> 04:24:56.860]   And this is a real thing.
[04:24:56.860 --> 04:24:59.020]   Like, you Google it, and see these dead ants
[04:24:59.020 --> 04:25:01.460]   with these fungal stabs coming out of them.
[04:25:01.460 --> 04:25:03.860]   It's like, holy God, this is crazy.
[04:25:03.860 --> 04:25:08.260]   And in the same topic,
[04:25:08.260 --> 04:25:09.740]   you go all the way to Lion's Mane,
[04:25:09.740 --> 04:25:11.780]   and it could actually help treat Alzheimer's,
[04:25:11.780 --> 04:25:14.500]   and treat depression, and Parkinson's,
[04:25:14.500 --> 04:25:16.740]   and regrow nerves, and so forth.
[04:25:16.740 --> 04:25:19.660]   Other things, they've shown some effectiveness
[04:25:19.660 --> 04:25:20.860]   against COVID.
[04:25:20.860 --> 04:25:24.220]   It's just so crazy, the diversity in the mushroom kingdom,
[04:25:24.220 --> 04:25:29.220]   of the medicinal applications, the pesticide applications.
[04:25:29.220 --> 04:25:32.340]   You can use it a lot to kind of save hay and trees.
[04:25:32.340 --> 04:25:33.620]   There's a lot of things you can do
[04:25:33.620 --> 04:25:37.340]   that combat all kinds of invasive species.
[04:25:37.340 --> 04:25:39.620]   And it's true, there's a lot of cool stuff
[04:25:39.620 --> 04:25:41.260]   with psychedelic mushrooms.
[04:25:41.260 --> 04:25:43.500]   And there's a great book from Michael Pollan,
[04:25:43.500 --> 04:25:44.900]   "How to Change Your Mind,"
[04:25:44.900 --> 04:25:46.340]   where he was really the first journalist
[04:25:46.340 --> 04:25:48.740]   in a long time to go and roll in crystals,
[04:25:48.740 --> 04:25:50.980]   work his way through the Johns Hopkins studies.
[04:25:50.980 --> 04:25:52.980]   But the long and short for me, when I read that book,
[04:25:52.980 --> 04:25:54.880]   like, okay, mind expansion is great,
[04:25:54.880 --> 04:25:59.300]   but look at the effectiveness of psychedelics,
[04:25:59.300 --> 04:26:02.180]   psilocybin mushrooms with SSRIs,
[04:26:02.180 --> 04:26:03.980]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[04:26:03.980 --> 04:26:05.540]   for the treatment of depression.
[04:26:05.540 --> 04:26:07.820]   They showed in the Johns Hopkins studies
[04:26:07.820 --> 04:26:10.540]   that they're equal or better in effectiveness in many cases.
[04:26:10.540 --> 04:26:12.100]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[04:26:12.100 --> 04:26:13.700]   - For the treatment of depression
[04:26:13.700 --> 04:26:16.660]   than a drug that you have to take forever.
[04:26:16.660 --> 04:26:18.540]   And this is just one or two treatments,
[04:26:18.540 --> 04:26:20.500]   and then you desist from it.
[04:26:20.500 --> 04:26:22.620]   That's a miracle, 'cause there's so many people
[04:26:22.620 --> 04:26:26.740]   suffer from severe depression, and it's a lifetime ailment.
[04:26:26.740 --> 04:26:29.020]   And the fact that we have something in the toolbox
[04:26:29.020 --> 04:26:32.380]   that we've underexplored is a very powerful thing.
[04:26:32.380 --> 04:26:34.500]   The other thing was end of life issues.
[04:26:34.500 --> 04:26:35.820]   A lot of people get cancer.
[04:26:35.820 --> 04:26:38.220]   I've lost people in the family from cancer.
[04:26:38.220 --> 04:26:41.100]   And it's so hard those last two, three months,
[04:26:41.100 --> 04:26:44.660]   'cause they kind of have this, they're in horrific pain,
[04:26:44.660 --> 04:26:45.660]   they're trying to find meaning,
[04:26:45.660 --> 04:26:47.500]   and why is this happening to me?
[04:26:47.500 --> 04:26:49.160]   And if you can just give them a substance
[04:26:49.160 --> 04:26:50.260]   that on the other side of it,
[04:26:50.260 --> 04:26:52.020]   there's a good chance they can come to peace
[04:26:52.020 --> 04:26:54.420]   with everything and die with a lot more dignity
[04:26:54.420 --> 04:26:57.820]   and happiness, that alone justifies
[04:26:57.820 --> 04:26:59.420]   an enormous amount of study.
[04:26:59.420 --> 04:27:01.500]   And the fact that these things are super cheap
[04:27:01.500 --> 04:27:03.900]   and they grow pretty much anywhere, it's pretty cool.
[04:27:03.900 --> 04:27:04.860]   Now on the commercial side,
[04:27:04.860 --> 04:27:06.980]   you can make a lot of money from mushrooms.
[04:27:06.980 --> 04:27:09.180]   I'm working with a company called Farmbox Foods,
[04:27:09.180 --> 04:27:12.140]   and it's one of the, they do both vertical
[04:27:12.140 --> 04:27:15.580]   hydroponic farming, they also do mushroom,
[04:27:15.580 --> 04:27:20.060]   and they put these amazing labs and shipping containers
[04:27:20.060 --> 04:27:22.060]   that are kind of like controlled environments.
[04:27:22.060 --> 04:27:24.220]   You can grow 400 pounds of gourmet mushrooms
[04:27:24.220 --> 04:27:26.100]   a single week off of that.
[04:27:26.100 --> 04:27:28.460]   And your margins can be up to 30% per year.
[04:27:28.460 --> 04:27:31.320]   If you're just selling them for food consumption,
[04:27:31.320 --> 04:27:32.240]   if you're doing supplements,
[04:27:32.240 --> 04:27:34.380]   they can be even higher than that.
[04:27:34.380 --> 04:27:35.460]   So it just kind of made sense
[04:27:35.460 --> 04:27:37.300]   from a diversification of assets to say,
[04:27:37.300 --> 04:27:38.940]   hey, let's do some stuff in hydroponics
[04:27:38.940 --> 04:27:40.880]   and aquaponics and in mushrooms.
[04:27:40.880 --> 04:27:43.220]   But the more I do, the more I learn that community,
[04:27:43.220 --> 04:27:45.380]   just the cooler that community is.
[04:27:45.380 --> 04:27:47.220]   Like I went to this beautiful mushroom festival
[04:27:47.220 --> 04:27:49.820]   in Cape Springs down in Georgia,
[04:27:49.820 --> 04:27:52.900]   and I met this guy named Bill Yule.
[04:27:52.900 --> 04:27:55.020]   And he just looks like a druid.
[04:27:55.020 --> 04:27:56.620]   You know, it's just like he lives in a tree
[04:27:56.620 --> 04:27:58.620]   and he opens up the tree and goes out and everything.
[04:27:58.620 --> 04:27:59.820]   And I was like, Bill, what do you do?
[04:27:59.820 --> 04:28:03.440]   He said, I go and I try to study beetles and boletes
[04:28:03.440 --> 04:28:05.080]   and a very particular type of beetle.
[04:28:05.080 --> 04:28:07.600]   And they mate in the most crazy way.
[04:28:07.600 --> 04:28:10.480]   It's like this beetle will fuse on top of another beetle
[04:28:10.480 --> 04:28:11.640]   and they'll vibrate.
[04:28:11.640 --> 04:28:12.840]   And if they make the right harmony,
[04:28:12.840 --> 04:28:13.680]   she'll mate with them.
[04:28:13.680 --> 04:28:14.920]   Otherwise, they'll kick her off.
[04:28:14.920 --> 04:28:16.280]   And you can only make the harmony
[04:28:16.280 --> 04:28:18.800]   while you're on a specific type of bolete mushroom.
[04:28:18.800 --> 04:28:20.480]   If it's anywhere else, the harmony.
[04:28:20.480 --> 04:28:21.960]   It's like, who the fuck does this?
[04:28:21.960 --> 04:28:22.800]   (laughing)
[04:28:22.800 --> 04:28:24.880]   It was like 20 years, 30 years,
[04:28:24.880 --> 04:28:27.860]   just thinking about goddamn beetles and bolete mushrooms.
[04:28:27.860 --> 04:28:29.000]   But that's that community.
[04:28:29.000 --> 04:28:31.560]   And they're the happiest people you'll ever meet.
[04:28:31.560 --> 04:28:33.240]   And they're just so much fun to talk to.
[04:28:33.240 --> 04:28:36.480]   And there's just so much lore there that's not discovered.
[04:28:36.480 --> 04:28:39.760]   The other thing is there's a ton of undiscovered mushrooms.
[04:28:39.760 --> 04:28:42.080]   So, you know, you go to my ranch up in Wyoming,
[04:28:42.080 --> 04:28:43.680]   go out that national forest next to it,
[04:28:43.680 --> 04:28:46.040]   you'll probably discover six or seven new species
[04:28:46.040 --> 04:28:48.960]   just doing some gene sequencing and things like that.
[04:28:48.960 --> 04:28:52.600]   So there's like a gold rush for new things to discover,
[04:28:52.600 --> 04:28:53.880]   to treat all kinds of things.
[04:28:53.880 --> 04:28:55.600]   So love mushrooms, love that community.
[04:28:55.600 --> 04:28:57.800]   I think there's a lot of wonderful medicinal properties
[04:28:57.800 --> 04:29:00.800]   and everybody there is just a lot of fun to hang out with.
[04:29:00.800 --> 04:29:03.040]   The other passion is aquaponics and hydroponics.
[04:29:03.040 --> 04:29:06.060]   And I got a lot more serious after COVID.
[04:29:06.060 --> 04:29:08.600]   I go to the supermarket, all the store shelves are barren.
[04:29:08.600 --> 04:29:12.080]   I say, guys, can you imagine if like we had a real big thing
[04:29:12.080 --> 04:29:13.440]   what this would be like?
[04:29:13.440 --> 04:29:15.520]   We need to have domestic food production.
[04:29:15.520 --> 04:29:18.000]   We need to have resilience at the community level.
[04:29:18.000 --> 04:29:21.240]   So let's go build a $40, $50 million aquaponics facility
[04:29:21.240 --> 04:29:23.420]   next to every major city.
[04:29:23.420 --> 04:29:26.320]   So at least you have some local production of food
[04:29:26.320 --> 04:29:27.880]   and people won't starve to death.
[04:29:27.880 --> 04:29:29.640]   Otherwise it's very bad.
[04:29:29.640 --> 04:29:31.280]   And again, the margins are phenomenal.
[04:29:31.280 --> 04:29:34.160]   They're 20%, 30% if you actually do it right
[04:29:34.160 --> 04:29:36.400]   and alternate your crops properly and so forth.
[04:29:36.400 --> 04:29:38.920]   And you create a lot of high paying jobs with it as well.
[04:29:38.920 --> 04:29:41.740]   - And so you kind of draw a lot of value
[04:29:41.740 --> 04:29:44.240]   from staying close to nature and all of these kinds of ways.
[04:29:44.240 --> 04:29:45.560]   They're keeping you humble.
[04:29:45.560 --> 04:29:46.680]   Like you said, what is it?
[04:29:46.680 --> 04:29:49.160]   The goat is still gonna crap on you.
[04:29:49.160 --> 04:29:50.720]   - Oh yeah, the donkeys will shit on you,
[04:29:50.720 --> 04:29:53.180]   whether you're broke or a billionaire.
[04:29:53.180 --> 04:29:54.020]   - That's a good line.
[04:29:54.020 --> 04:29:56.520]   That's the one like, (laughs)
[04:29:56.520 --> 04:29:59.380]   that'll be the line you'll be remembered for.
[04:29:59.380 --> 04:30:00.220]   - Right.
[04:30:00.220 --> 04:30:01.380]   - If the universe has a sense of humor.
[04:30:01.380 --> 04:30:03.620]   - Yes, it's a Neo Yogi Berra.
[04:30:03.620 --> 04:30:07.780]   - So I think mushrooms is a good place to ask
[04:30:07.780 --> 04:30:11.180]   about my friend, Joe Rogan.
[04:30:11.180 --> 04:30:13.300]   So I keep focusing on the Cardano community,
[04:30:13.300 --> 04:30:15.900]   kept saying, keep saying things like,
[04:30:15.900 --> 04:30:19.620]   likes podcast first, then Joe Rogan experience.
[04:30:19.620 --> 04:30:22.940]   I guess I'm the moon and Joe's Mars in this metaphor.
[04:30:23.980 --> 04:30:26.380]   Since I'm a CS person, I can talk a little bit
[04:30:26.380 --> 04:30:29.140]   more fluently about cryptocurrency
[04:30:29.140 --> 04:30:33.060]   'cause fundamentally cryptocurrency is a computational idea.
[04:30:33.060 --> 04:30:34.780]   But then there's somebody like Joe,
[04:30:34.780 --> 04:30:36.260]   who's more like an everyman.
[04:30:36.260 --> 04:30:39.340]   He does not necessarily know the technical intricacies
[04:30:39.340 --> 04:30:40.720]   of cryptocurrencies.
[04:30:40.720 --> 04:30:43.260]   What kind of, and I don't think he's had
[04:30:43.260 --> 04:30:45.140]   a cryptocurrency person on.
[04:30:45.140 --> 04:30:47.480]   - Didn't he interview Andreas on Tenopolis?
[04:30:47.480 --> 04:30:48.320]   - Oh, he did.
[04:30:48.320 --> 04:30:49.380]   That's right, a long, long time ago.
[04:30:49.380 --> 04:30:50.620]   But that was almost like,
[04:30:52.380 --> 04:30:54.860]   the cryptocurrency space goes through phases.
[04:30:54.860 --> 04:30:57.620]   And I think we're in a new era of some kind.
[04:30:57.620 --> 04:31:01.860]   And how do you talk to Joe about Cardano?
[04:31:01.860 --> 04:31:04.900]   How do you talk to Joe about what the heck?
[04:31:04.900 --> 04:31:06.220]   I remember somebody tried to explain to him
[04:31:06.220 --> 04:31:07.940]   what Dogecoin is.
[04:31:07.940 --> 04:31:10.980]   How do you explain this whole space of what Bitcoin is,
[04:31:10.980 --> 04:31:13.820]   of where Ethereum is, of where Cardano and smart contracts
[04:31:13.820 --> 04:31:15.220]   and some of this proof of work,
[04:31:15.220 --> 04:31:18.500]   what this proof of stake ideas that we've been talking about?
[04:31:18.500 --> 04:31:19.340]   - You don't.
[04:31:19.340 --> 04:31:20.880]   What you do is you start with applications
[04:31:20.880 --> 04:31:21.820]   that they're interested in.
[04:31:21.820 --> 04:31:22.940]   So he's an elk hunter.
[04:31:22.940 --> 04:31:25.820]   And so he's probably interested in elk tags, right?
[04:31:25.820 --> 04:31:26.660]   So you start there.
[04:31:26.660 --> 04:31:29.180]   And you say that whole system can be put on a blockchain
[04:31:29.180 --> 04:31:31.740]   and here's how it's gonna be better for you.
[04:31:31.740 --> 04:31:32.580]   You say that's what you do.
[04:31:32.580 --> 04:31:35.100]   You always connect it to something they know and love.
[04:31:35.100 --> 04:31:36.540]   And then once they get that, they say,
[04:31:36.540 --> 04:31:37.860]   "Oh, that's really cool."
[04:31:37.860 --> 04:31:39.620]   And then they ask, "What else can you do with it?
[04:31:39.620 --> 04:31:41.180]   "What else can you sell me on it?"
[04:31:41.180 --> 04:31:43.140]   And you kind of work your way outwards there.
[04:31:43.140 --> 04:31:45.500]   Problem technologists make is they're so damn in love
[04:31:45.500 --> 04:31:46.440]   with the technology.
[04:31:46.440 --> 04:31:48.180]   They have that tail wagging the dog
[04:31:48.180 --> 04:31:50.420]   where they just want to talk about the technology
[04:31:50.420 --> 04:31:51.980]   and how incredibly cool it is.
[04:31:51.980 --> 04:31:52.820]   And that's fun.
[04:31:52.820 --> 04:31:53.740]   It's like talking about math.
[04:31:53.740 --> 04:31:55.820]   Oh God, let's talk about corbordisms.
[04:31:55.820 --> 04:31:58.100]   That's fun, all right, yeah.
[04:31:58.100 --> 04:31:59.540]   Everybody's eyes glows over.
[04:31:59.540 --> 04:32:01.380]   No, you always have to connect it
[04:32:01.380 --> 04:32:03.500]   to the interest of the particular person
[04:32:03.500 --> 04:32:04.820]   and what they care about, what they love,
[04:32:04.820 --> 04:32:05.660]   what they need.
[04:32:05.660 --> 04:32:07.140]   Royalty payments.
[04:32:07.140 --> 04:32:08.060]   He's a big guy.
[04:32:08.060 --> 04:32:09.420]   He's got the Spotify thing.
[04:32:09.420 --> 04:32:10.980]   He's got all these things going on.
[04:32:10.980 --> 04:32:13.120]   Intellectual property is probably pretty important, Joe,
[04:32:13.120 --> 04:32:14.380]   at some juncture.
[04:32:14.380 --> 04:32:15.500]   So NFTs.
[04:32:15.500 --> 04:32:18.520]   We can talk about this concept of perpetual royalties.
[04:32:18.520 --> 04:32:21.460]   So for example, let's say that you create a piece of art.
[04:32:21.460 --> 04:32:25.340]   You can build into the token itself a perpetual royalty
[04:32:25.340 --> 04:32:26.680]   to something you care about.
[04:32:26.680 --> 04:32:29.640]   Maybe every time it sells, it pays it back to you.
[04:32:29.640 --> 04:32:31.420]   Or maybe every time it sells,
[04:32:31.420 --> 04:32:33.300]   it donates to some clean water charity
[04:32:33.300 --> 04:32:34.620]   or something like that.
[04:32:34.620 --> 04:32:37.620]   The point is that the actual acquisition of the NFT
[04:32:37.620 --> 04:32:40.180]   requires adherence to that smart contract.
[04:32:40.180 --> 04:32:42.220]   So people can't deviate from your desire
[04:32:42.220 --> 04:32:43.820]   even after you die.
[04:32:43.820 --> 04:32:46.940]   So stuff from Andy Warhol or from Picasso,
[04:32:46.940 --> 04:32:49.480]   that can still be generating some donation
[04:32:49.480 --> 04:32:52.120]   every time a Picasso sells to something else.
[04:32:52.120 --> 04:32:54.160]   You can do that with NFTs.
[04:32:54.160 --> 04:32:56.000]   And so he starts thinking, God, what else can I do?
[04:32:56.000 --> 04:32:56.940]   I do shows.
[04:32:56.940 --> 04:32:59.080]   Maybe I can do my tickets with these types of things.
[04:32:59.080 --> 04:33:01.320]   Maybe I can do loyalty points for my fans.
[04:33:01.320 --> 04:33:02.680]   So now you've got him engaged
[04:33:02.680 --> 04:33:04.840]   and he's thinking of all the opportunities for him
[04:33:04.840 --> 04:33:07.200]   and it gives him an incentive to anchor
[04:33:07.200 --> 04:33:08.880]   and connect to those concepts.
[04:33:08.880 --> 04:33:11.200]   And then over time, he starts asking questions.
[04:33:11.200 --> 04:33:12.960]   Well, how do we know it's secure?
[04:33:12.960 --> 04:33:15.400]   Then we can talk about proof of work or proof of stake
[04:33:15.400 --> 04:33:16.320]   or these types of things.
[04:33:16.320 --> 04:33:18.200]   Well, so this is how it stays secure
[04:33:18.200 --> 04:33:19.480]   if you're really interested.
[04:33:19.480 --> 04:33:22.840]   And there's an incentive to have the attention span
[04:33:22.840 --> 04:33:25.000]   necessary to do the homework, eat the broccoli
[04:33:25.000 --> 04:33:25.920]   and get over that hill.
[04:33:25.920 --> 04:33:27.880]   - But it's also an opportunity, at least it was for me,
[04:33:27.880 --> 04:33:30.440]   especially with Bitcoin a while ago,
[04:33:30.440 --> 04:33:34.000]   is to take another look at the monetary system.
[04:33:34.000 --> 04:33:36.400]   Even look at the, you know, I've been looking quite a bit
[04:33:36.400 --> 04:33:38.120]   at the history of the 20th century
[04:33:38.120 --> 04:33:39.960]   and sort of look at that history
[04:33:39.960 --> 04:33:42.240]   through the perspective of the monetary system,
[04:33:42.240 --> 04:33:44.080]   or the gold standard and all those kinds of things.
[04:33:44.400 --> 04:33:47.400]   Just add that little layer of consideration
[04:33:47.400 --> 04:33:51.360]   of how much money, of how money can be used
[04:33:51.360 --> 04:33:55.400]   by people in power to control the populace.
[04:33:55.400 --> 04:33:59.980]   And it's fascinating to look at the history
[04:33:59.980 --> 04:34:00.960]   from that perspective.
[04:34:00.960 --> 04:34:03.360]   And then that allows you to look at the future
[04:34:03.360 --> 04:34:06.720]   of how we can change that in order to empower people.
[04:34:06.720 --> 04:34:09.800]   And then of course, the governance thing
[04:34:09.800 --> 04:34:12.840]   that you're working on is fascinating because,
[04:34:12.840 --> 04:34:14.520]   I mean, I don't know, but it seems like
[04:34:14.520 --> 04:34:16.880]   a deeply broken aspect of our government
[04:34:16.880 --> 04:34:18.800]   is just the voting system.
[04:34:18.800 --> 04:34:21.760]   And discussing how that could be revolutionized
[04:34:21.760 --> 04:34:24.000]   is fascinating because a lot of conversations
[04:34:24.000 --> 04:34:29.000]   end up being on the internet about like number go up,
[04:34:29.000 --> 04:34:30.960]   which is like financial side.
[04:34:30.960 --> 04:34:32.960]   And to me personally, at least,
[04:34:32.960 --> 04:34:36.760]   I think that's the same for Joe, that's just boring.
[04:34:36.760 --> 04:34:40.140]   Like it's the investing, the financial side of it,
[04:34:40.140 --> 04:34:42.680]   I know it has a lot of impact, but it's kind of boring.
[04:34:42.680 --> 04:34:43.520]   - Right.
[04:34:43.520 --> 04:34:45.080]   - 'Cause long-term is not gonna have any impact.
[04:34:45.080 --> 04:34:47.840]   If the ideas are strong, long-term is going to win.
[04:34:47.840 --> 04:34:49.040]   - Right. - If the ideas are weak,
[04:34:49.040 --> 04:34:50.400]   long-term is gonna lose.
[04:34:50.400 --> 04:34:52.800]   The ups and downs of the short-term don't matter.
[04:34:52.800 --> 04:34:57.160]   That's just like casino games that you play.
[04:34:57.160 --> 04:35:00.240]   Speaking of games, video games,
[04:35:00.240 --> 04:35:01.320]   gotta ask you about those.
[04:35:01.320 --> 04:35:02.160]   - Okay.
[04:35:02.160 --> 04:35:04.200]   - You mentioned Diablo, maybe you're a fan of Diablo.
[04:35:04.200 --> 04:35:06.200]   - Well, yeah, Diablo 2 was great.
[04:35:06.200 --> 04:35:07.280]   - Do you like Skyrim?
[04:35:07.280 --> 04:35:09.400]   - Skyrim was great too, like the Elder Scrolls.
[04:35:09.400 --> 04:35:11.280]   I actually bought the game that the Elder Scrolls
[04:35:11.280 --> 04:35:13.000]   was based on, do you know that?
[04:35:13.000 --> 04:35:16.320]   So way back in the day, the Elder Scrolls series
[04:35:16.320 --> 04:35:18.600]   was inspired by a game called Legends of Valor
[04:35:18.600 --> 04:35:20.100]   that I played when I was a little kid,
[04:35:20.100 --> 04:35:22.040]   and it doesn't actually have an ending.
[04:35:22.040 --> 04:35:23.640]   They ran out of money before they finished it,
[04:35:23.640 --> 04:35:25.680]   so they just kind of like put this little thing on
[04:35:25.680 --> 04:35:27.440]   and said, "Okay, but you never finish it."
[04:35:27.440 --> 04:35:29.680]   So I actually bought all the intellectual property
[04:35:29.680 --> 04:35:30.760]   from the game. - Yeah, I saw that.
[04:35:30.760 --> 04:35:32.000]   I didn't know there was a connection
[04:35:32.000 --> 04:35:33.960]   between Legends of Valor and Arena.
[04:35:33.960 --> 04:35:34.960]   - I forget the name of the guy,
[04:35:34.960 --> 04:35:37.640]   was it Todd something at Bethesda?
[04:35:37.640 --> 04:35:40.240]   He played it and he was inspired by it,
[04:35:40.240 --> 04:35:42.520]   and then he created Arena right after playing it.
[04:35:42.520 --> 04:35:45.240]   - That was such a good game, Arena, Daggerfall.
[04:35:45.240 --> 04:35:47.040]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[04:35:47.040 --> 04:35:48.920]   - I had a copy of Daggerfall when I was a kid,
[04:35:48.920 --> 04:35:50.960]   but it had a bug in, so when you left the dungeon,
[04:35:50.960 --> 04:35:53.080]   it would crash, and this was before,
[04:35:53.080 --> 04:35:54.840]   like you can get an easy patch for it,
[04:35:54.840 --> 04:35:56.880]   so I never actually played Daggerfall.
[04:35:56.880 --> 04:35:58.580]   I entered in through Morrowind.
[04:35:58.580 --> 04:36:02.880]   - Yeah, no, the Daggerfall was the fascinating thing,
[04:36:02.880 --> 04:36:03.960]   which is jumping all over,
[04:36:03.960 --> 04:36:05.440]   but we'll return to Legends of Valor
[04:36:05.440 --> 04:36:06.400]   'cause I wanna ask you about that,
[04:36:06.400 --> 04:36:08.800]   but Daggerfall was fascinating 'cause I think
[04:36:08.800 --> 04:36:11.080]   of all of the Elder Scroll games,
[04:36:11.080 --> 04:36:15.240]   it was like the largest because it was randomly generated.
[04:36:15.240 --> 04:36:16.640]   - Right. - It would randomly generate
[04:36:16.640 --> 04:36:18.680]   the worlds, the dungeons and so on,
[04:36:18.680 --> 04:36:20.320]   which is fascinating to think about,
[04:36:20.320 --> 04:36:22.200]   like how big can you make the world,
[04:36:22.200 --> 04:36:27.320]   both in actuality and feel.
[04:36:27.320 --> 04:36:29.760]   It's incredible to have a video game,
[04:36:29.760 --> 04:36:32.180]   I don't know how many video games do this well,
[04:36:32.180 --> 04:36:35.880]   where the feeling is you can be lost here forever,
[04:36:35.880 --> 04:36:38.480]   you can live here,
[04:36:38.480 --> 04:36:40.800]   'cause most video games have a bottom
[04:36:40.800 --> 04:36:42.600]   that feels like you can run out of stuff,
[04:36:42.600 --> 04:36:45.800]   where Daggerfall was like, I can just keep doing this.
[04:36:45.800 --> 04:36:47.200]   At least that's what I felt at the time,
[04:36:47.200 --> 04:36:50.200]   but yeah, what the heck, Legends of Valor,
[04:36:50.200 --> 04:36:51.800]   what's the idea there?
[04:36:51.800 --> 04:36:54.680]   - Well, there's really nothing about it
[04:36:54.680 --> 04:36:56.240]   that's super compelling today.
[04:36:56.240 --> 04:36:59.360]   I mean, there's a nostalgia of youth that's there,
[04:36:59.360 --> 04:37:02.120]   but it doesn't even have a class system, a level system,
[04:37:02.120 --> 04:37:04.320]   the combat system is terrible, there's no journal,
[04:37:04.320 --> 04:37:06.220]   the magic system is terrible and so forth,
[04:37:06.220 --> 04:37:08.120]   and so I just wanted to start somewhere,
[04:37:08.120 --> 04:37:09.160]   and I felt like that would be
[04:37:09.160 --> 04:37:11.080]   an incredibly fun overhaul project.
[04:37:11.080 --> 04:37:13.120]   I kind of got the idea from Beamdog Studios
[04:37:13.120 --> 04:37:15.160]   when they did another one of my favorite games,
[04:37:15.160 --> 04:37:16.920]   remember Baldur's Gate?
[04:37:16.920 --> 04:37:17.760]   Yeah, and they did the--
[04:37:17.760 --> 04:37:18.760]   - I love that, Baldur's Gate 2.
[04:37:18.760 --> 04:37:20.960]   - Oh yeah, the enhanced edition was great.
[04:37:20.960 --> 04:37:22.840]   They should have never just done Throne of Baal,
[04:37:22.840 --> 04:37:25.320]   they should have done an actual proper sequel,
[04:37:25.320 --> 04:37:27.480]   God, down that whole road.
[04:37:27.480 --> 04:37:29.880]   But anyway, I got the idea there,
[04:37:29.880 --> 04:37:32.440]   I said, well, take some old piece of IP,
[04:37:32.440 --> 04:37:34.920]   and then you can kind of retrofit it and clean it up,
[04:37:34.920 --> 04:37:36.400]   and what's nice about Legends of Valor
[04:37:36.400 --> 04:37:37.400]   is it's a blank slate.
[04:37:37.400 --> 04:37:39.240]   You can do your own Elder Scrolls,
[04:37:39.240 --> 04:37:40.520]   you can create your own class system
[04:37:40.520 --> 04:37:42.520]   and level system and so forth.
[04:37:42.520 --> 04:37:43.800]   You could write some beautiful,
[04:37:43.800 --> 04:37:46.200]   exciting, fun narratives for that,
[04:37:46.200 --> 04:37:48.280]   and also it gives me a chance to explore
[04:37:48.280 --> 04:37:49.600]   a lot of things I think should be
[04:37:49.600 --> 04:37:50.840]   dragged into game development,
[04:37:50.840 --> 04:37:53.680]   like algorithmically generated music is one example.
[04:37:53.680 --> 04:37:55.880]   The problem with sound in games, as you mentioned,
[04:37:55.880 --> 04:37:57.920]   you play lots and lots of hours,
[04:37:57.920 --> 04:38:00.000]   but your sound content is much smaller,
[04:38:00.000 --> 04:38:02.580]   so you have tons of repetition in the soundtrack.
[04:38:02.580 --> 04:38:05.000]   So what if you could connect the music
[04:38:05.000 --> 04:38:06.680]   to the state of the game world,
[04:38:06.680 --> 04:38:08.680]   and it automatically, through some process,
[04:38:08.680 --> 04:38:09.520]   will generate music?
[04:38:09.520 --> 04:38:11.760]   And there's actually people who study this.
[04:38:11.760 --> 04:38:12.920]   And so that's one dimension.
[04:38:12.920 --> 04:38:15.120]   The other thing is you have things like GPT-3 and so forth.
[04:38:15.120 --> 04:38:18.280]   There was a great game, Event Zero,
[04:38:18.280 --> 04:38:20.120]   and it came out in 2016,
[04:38:20.120 --> 04:38:23.920]   where you could actually have a dialogue with an AI,
[04:38:23.920 --> 04:38:25.640]   and you're like a marooned astronaut
[04:38:25.640 --> 04:38:28.000]   on a space station that's abandoned,
[04:38:28.000 --> 04:38:30.560]   and you have to somehow work with this AI
[04:38:30.560 --> 04:38:32.000]   through communicating with it
[04:38:32.000 --> 04:38:34.760]   to convince you to take you home.
[04:38:34.760 --> 04:38:37.000]   But the AI is a bit duplicitous,
[04:38:37.000 --> 04:38:38.800]   and I don't want to spoil the plot of the game,
[04:38:38.800 --> 04:38:39.980]   because it's such a cool game,
[04:38:39.980 --> 04:38:41.800]   but it's actually like a paint by never.
[04:38:41.800 --> 04:38:43.000]   It's almost like Zork,
[04:38:43.000 --> 04:38:46.520]   where you don't have pre-selected dialogue.
[04:38:46.520 --> 04:38:48.280]   You actually type in the terminal,
[04:38:48.280 --> 04:38:50.360]   and the AI will reply to you back and forth.
[04:38:50.360 --> 04:38:51.600]   And this was 2016,
[04:38:51.600 --> 04:38:54.120]   and it's like things have gotten an order of magnitude better.
[04:38:54.120 --> 04:38:55.660]   So the evolution of that tech,
[04:38:55.660 --> 04:38:57.280]   I think within the next five years,
[04:38:57.280 --> 04:38:58.240]   brought into video games,
[04:38:58.240 --> 04:39:00.920]   could give you incredibly cool dialogue
[04:39:00.920 --> 04:39:02.880]   inside the game.
[04:39:02.880 --> 04:39:04.520]   So algorithmically generated music,
[04:39:04.520 --> 04:39:06.480]   better dialogue, better gameplay mechanics.
[04:39:06.480 --> 04:39:10.680]   Also, I'd love to explore alternative physics systems,
[04:39:10.680 --> 04:39:11.920]   alternative geometries,
[04:39:11.920 --> 04:39:15.560]   like hyperbolic geometry or these types of things.
[04:39:15.560 --> 04:39:19.040]   And there's actually Hyperbolica is a game that does that.
[04:39:19.040 --> 04:39:21.480]   And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well,
[04:39:21.480 --> 04:39:23.680]   and bring those elements into a game design.
[04:39:23.680 --> 04:39:25.160]   And that's what we'll do is Legends of Valor.
[04:39:25.160 --> 04:39:26.600]   So it'll be kind of like Skyrim,
[04:39:26.600 --> 04:39:28.560]   but with a lot of really cool new shit.
[04:39:28.560 --> 04:39:30.920]   It's kind of like, I saw Aerosmith years ago,
[04:39:30.920 --> 04:39:31.760]   and he was out there, he's like,
[04:39:31.760 --> 04:39:32.760]   "Do you like the old shit?
[04:39:32.760 --> 04:39:34.240]   Do you like new shit?"
[04:39:34.240 --> 04:39:35.240]   Kind of middle shit.
[04:39:35.240 --> 04:39:36.080]   (laughing)
[04:39:36.080 --> 04:39:36.920]   You know, so.
[04:39:36.920 --> 04:39:38.040]   - So you're going for the middle.
[04:39:38.040 --> 04:39:39.880]   - Yeah, I'm gonna try to do some of the old
[04:39:39.880 --> 04:39:41.680]   and some of the new, and bring it in.
[04:39:41.680 --> 04:39:43.480]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[04:39:43.480 --> 04:39:45.960]   And what's nice about it is that
[04:39:45.960 --> 04:39:51.800]   there is a lot of new play in the market
[04:39:51.800 --> 04:39:54.440]   because of the Microsoft acquisition of Bethesda.
[04:39:54.440 --> 04:39:56.480]   They've been losing employees like crazy,
[04:39:56.480 --> 04:39:58.400]   and there's a lot of belief that Elder Scrolls VI
[04:39:58.400 --> 04:40:00.240]   will not live up to expectations
[04:40:00.240 --> 04:40:01.320]   because Microsoft will kill it.
[04:40:01.320 --> 04:40:03.760]   - I will tweet, okay, listen to me.
[04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:07.920]   I will go into, I'm all about love on the internet,
[04:40:07.920 --> 04:40:09.800]   but I will go hard at you, Microsoft,
[04:40:09.800 --> 04:40:11.400]   if you screw up Elder Scrolls.
[04:40:11.400 --> 04:40:14.120]   - Well, we might have to do a spiritual successor, right?
[04:40:14.120 --> 04:40:16.120]   And it might have to happen with Legends of Valor.
[04:40:16.120 --> 04:40:17.440]   You never know.
[04:40:17.440 --> 04:40:20.320]   But it's a passion project, so I have no time for it at all.
[04:40:20.320 --> 04:40:22.080]   It's like so low on my list of things to do.
[04:40:22.080 --> 04:40:24.640]   So I'll probably do it in 2022, 2023,
[04:40:24.640 --> 04:40:27.440]   and we'll build a nice crew, and we'll do it in Wyoming,
[04:40:27.440 --> 04:40:29.520]   probably in Wheatland or some really small town,
[04:40:29.520 --> 04:40:31.280]   and we'll import everybody,
[04:40:31.280 --> 04:40:32.960]   and then we'll have to build the whole city up
[04:40:32.960 --> 04:40:34.760]   like Elon is doing here in Texas.
[04:40:34.760 --> 04:40:36.720]   It'll be a fun project.
[04:40:36.720 --> 04:40:38.560]   - Well, I like programmatically generated music.
[04:40:38.560 --> 04:40:40.440]   You mentioned Baldur's Gate.
[04:40:40.440 --> 04:40:41.920]   - By the way, Haskell Frameworks for that.
[04:40:41.920 --> 04:40:43.000]   Utopia is one.
[04:40:43.000 --> 04:40:44.000]   - For generating music?
[04:40:44.000 --> 04:40:45.480]   - Yeah, for doing it.
[04:40:45.480 --> 04:40:46.720]   - I wonder how successful that could be,
[04:40:46.720 --> 04:40:49.120]   'cause I remember Baldur's Gate was the first game
[04:40:49.120 --> 04:40:52.200]   where I realized music is so important to the game.
[04:40:52.200 --> 04:40:54.160]   It was the thing I remembered about the game.
[04:40:54.160 --> 04:40:57.520]   It was the reason, it was the thing I thought about
[04:40:57.520 --> 04:40:59.480]   when I was away from the game,
[04:40:59.480 --> 04:41:02.760]   is the feeling it created, that music.
[04:41:02.760 --> 04:41:04.600]   I don't even remember the music anymore,
[04:41:04.600 --> 04:41:05.840]   but I remember the music.
[04:41:05.840 --> 04:41:08.160]   (Jerry humming)
[04:41:08.160 --> 04:41:10.440]   - Jeremy Soule, I think, was the composer.
[04:41:10.440 --> 04:41:11.960]   - Yeah. - It was great.
[04:41:11.960 --> 04:41:13.960]   And actually getting like Rahman Jawadi
[04:41:13.960 --> 04:41:16.920]   or Bear McCready in to do that, it would be so cool.
[04:41:16.920 --> 04:41:18.120]   (Jerry laughing)
[04:41:18.120 --> 04:41:19.600]   - Okay, this is awesome.
[04:41:19.600 --> 04:41:20.520]   Ridiculous question.
[04:41:20.520 --> 04:41:22.640]   What's the, maybe let's say,
[04:41:22.640 --> 04:41:25.080]   top three greatest video games of all time?
[04:41:25.080 --> 04:41:28.360]   - Yeah, Baldur's Gate's definitely in the top three.
[04:41:28.360 --> 04:41:30.280]   Arcanum is my favorite game.
[04:41:30.280 --> 04:41:34.480]   And Arcanum was, Troika Games was just this amazing studio
[04:41:34.480 --> 04:41:37.920]   where they took the time to build
[04:41:37.920 --> 04:41:40.480]   probably the most compelling game worlds.
[04:41:40.480 --> 04:41:42.160]   In the case of Arcanum, it takes place
[04:41:42.160 --> 04:41:44.960]   in kind of like a 19th century Victorian England play,
[04:41:44.960 --> 04:41:46.320]   so it's steampunk,
[04:41:46.320 --> 04:41:48.640]   but then there's also magic inside this game world.
[04:41:48.640 --> 04:41:50.680]   And there's this crazy juxtaposition
[04:41:50.680 --> 04:41:52.040]   between magic and technology.
[04:41:52.040 --> 04:41:54.720]   And the more technology you have, magic stops working.
[04:41:54.720 --> 04:41:57.160]   The more magic you have, it disrupts technology.
[04:41:57.160 --> 04:41:58.600]   So all the people on the magic side
[04:41:58.600 --> 04:42:00.760]   hate the technology people and vice versa.
[04:42:00.760 --> 04:42:03.320]   And so you're just this character in this game world
[04:42:03.320 --> 04:42:06.120]   and you're just trying to figure out like where do you fit?
[04:42:06.120 --> 04:42:08.760]   And it has this incredible plot
[04:42:08.760 --> 04:42:11.680]   where you're kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin
[04:42:11.680 --> 04:42:15.580]   that gets shot down and you get dragged into this conspiracy
[04:42:15.580 --> 04:42:17.640]   and you have to kind of figure out the conspiracy
[04:42:17.640 --> 04:42:18.920]   as you go through the whole game world.
[04:42:18.920 --> 04:42:20.200]   And you meet all these different races
[04:42:20.200 --> 04:42:21.960]   like the elves and the dwarves and so forth.
[04:42:21.960 --> 04:42:24.280]   And they've all been impacted by the proliferation
[04:42:24.280 --> 04:42:25.640]   of technology in different ways.
[04:42:25.640 --> 04:42:28.480]   Like the humans use steam engines to clear cut
[04:42:28.480 --> 04:42:30.760]   all the forest and it caused a lot of problems.
[04:42:30.760 --> 04:42:33.480]   The dwarves leaked that technology to the humans
[04:42:33.480 --> 04:42:36.080]   and so they kind of got exiled for it and so forth.
[04:42:36.080 --> 04:42:38.120]   And you have to decide like where do you fit all this?
[04:42:38.120 --> 04:42:40.000]   And you have a lot of choices as a player.
[04:42:40.000 --> 04:42:41.320]   You can be on the magic side,
[04:42:41.320 --> 04:42:43.680]   the technology side kind of be neutral.
[04:42:43.680 --> 04:42:46.140]   There's like 40 different endings for the game.
[04:42:46.140 --> 04:42:47.400]   It's just incredible.
[04:42:47.400 --> 04:42:48.840]   This is all like 2000.
[04:42:48.840 --> 04:42:51.200]   And you talk about a procedurally generated world,
[04:42:51.200 --> 04:42:53.080]   you have a quick travel, but if you want,
[04:42:53.080 --> 04:42:55.040]   you just walk and the world randomly generates.
[04:42:55.040 --> 04:42:56.120]   But it's not like Daggerfall
[04:42:56.120 --> 04:42:58.040]   where there was interesting things along the way.
[04:42:58.040 --> 04:42:59.820]   So it was really ahead of its time
[04:42:59.820 --> 04:43:03.360]   and it was kind of the last of a generation of games.
[04:43:03.360 --> 04:43:05.400]   It was based on the same framework
[04:43:05.400 --> 04:43:07.320]   that Interplay used for Fallout,
[04:43:07.320 --> 04:43:09.440]   the original Fallout and Fallout 2.
[04:43:09.440 --> 04:43:10.880]   So that was really a cool setup.
[04:43:10.880 --> 04:43:12.280]   - So how were the graphics?
[04:43:12.280 --> 04:43:13.120]   They were not as interesting.
[04:43:13.120 --> 04:43:15.700]   - Oh, it's isometric three, top down.
[04:43:15.700 --> 04:43:17.960]   So yeah, kind of like the Fallout look.
[04:43:17.960 --> 04:43:21.560]   And so it doesn't hold up super well today,
[04:43:21.560 --> 04:43:22.920]   but that was never the point.
[04:43:22.920 --> 04:43:24.960]   It was a more of a story driven game.
[04:43:24.960 --> 04:43:26.760]   But it was one of the very few games
[04:43:26.760 --> 04:43:27.840]   where at the very end of the game,
[04:43:27.840 --> 04:43:31.040]   you could actually talk the villain into killing himself
[04:43:31.040 --> 04:43:33.520]   instead of fighting you.
[04:43:33.520 --> 04:43:35.560]   If you, and you had to really work at it.
[04:43:35.560 --> 04:43:37.380]   You had to become a master of persuasion
[04:43:37.380 --> 04:43:39.320]   and get your charisma score maxed out
[04:43:39.320 --> 04:43:40.920]   and learn all this stuff along the way.
[04:43:40.920 --> 04:43:42.520]   And you have this philosophical debate
[04:43:42.520 --> 04:43:44.120]   over the nature of life and death with him.
[04:43:44.120 --> 04:43:44.940]   - That's amazing.
[04:43:44.940 --> 04:43:45.920]   - Yeah, and then you're just like,
[04:43:45.920 --> 04:43:47.520]   by the way, you're wrong and here's why.
[04:43:47.520 --> 04:43:48.760]   And he's like, oh yeah, you got a point.
[04:43:48.760 --> 04:43:50.000]   I'm just gonna kill myself.
[04:43:50.000 --> 04:43:51.600]   (both laughing)
[04:43:51.600 --> 04:43:52.980]   I was like, wow, this is great.
[04:43:52.980 --> 04:43:54.900]   Planescape Torment is the other one.
[04:43:54.900 --> 04:43:56.120]   I think is probably the greatest.
[04:43:56.120 --> 04:43:56.960]   - What's it called?
[04:43:56.960 --> 04:43:57.780]   Planescape?
[04:43:57.780 --> 04:43:59.400]   - Yeah, it's another one on the Infinity Engine,
[04:43:59.400 --> 04:44:01.280]   which was what was used for Baldur's Gate.
[04:44:01.280 --> 04:44:02.760]   So it looks like Baldur's Gate.
[04:44:02.760 --> 04:44:05.960]   And God, that was such an incredibly well-written game.
[04:44:05.960 --> 04:44:07.680]   You play this character called the Nameless One,
[04:44:07.680 --> 04:44:10.040]   this little blue guy, and you wake up in a morgue.
[04:44:10.040 --> 04:44:11.880]   And it turns out that you're immortal.
[04:44:11.880 --> 04:44:14.180]   And every time you die, you lose all your memories.
[04:44:14.180 --> 04:44:17.360]   And so you've just been apparently living this life
[04:44:17.360 --> 04:44:18.600]   for a very long time.
[04:44:18.600 --> 04:44:19.960]   And you meet all these people
[04:44:19.960 --> 04:44:22.320]   in this crazy city called Sigil who know you,
[04:44:22.320 --> 04:44:23.640]   but you don't know yourself.
[04:44:23.640 --> 04:44:25.680]   And you're trying to figure out your name, your identity,
[04:44:25.680 --> 04:44:28.720]   and why do you have this curse where you live forever,
[04:44:28.720 --> 04:44:31.120]   but you keep forgetting every time you get killed.
[04:44:31.120 --> 04:44:33.600]   And it turns out you weren't such a nice person
[04:44:33.600 --> 04:44:35.080]   throughout this entire game world.
[04:44:35.080 --> 04:44:36.560]   But then again, there's this question of,
[04:44:36.560 --> 04:44:40.320]   well, if you can start over and you lose all your memories,
[04:44:40.320 --> 04:44:42.680]   do you have a chance for redemption or not?
[04:44:42.680 --> 04:44:45.080]   So it's an incredible game, Planescape Torment.
[04:44:45.080 --> 04:44:46.520]   And it's actually another one of those games
[04:44:46.520 --> 04:44:48.920]   where you can never actually have a fight.
[04:44:48.920 --> 04:44:50.800]   You can just kind of talk your way out of everything.
[04:44:50.800 --> 04:44:53.640]   And there's probably like a thousand pages of dialogue
[04:44:53.640 --> 04:44:54.480]   inside the game.
[04:44:54.480 --> 04:44:56.400]   Those guys had a lot of fun and a lot of drugs
[04:44:56.400 --> 04:44:57.840]   making that game.
[04:44:57.840 --> 04:45:00.440]   - Do you think these three games are the kinds
[04:45:00.440 --> 04:45:02.360]   that would still be okay to play today?
[04:45:02.360 --> 04:45:03.880]   Or are they forever lost in time
[04:45:03.880 --> 04:45:08.880]   because we sort of got desensitized to the richness
[04:45:08.880 --> 04:45:11.360]   of computer graphics and all those kinds of things
[04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:12.360]   in modern games?
[04:45:12.360 --> 04:45:13.960]   - I think you can enhance these games
[04:45:13.960 --> 04:45:17.440]   because your storytelling medium is so much more engaging.
[04:45:17.440 --> 04:45:19.400]   You know, I was at the movie theater before COVID
[04:45:19.400 --> 04:45:21.160]   and the person to the left of me
[04:45:21.160 --> 04:45:23.040]   was looking at their cell phone during the movie.
[04:45:23.040 --> 04:45:24.000]   And the person to the right of me
[04:45:24.000 --> 04:45:25.080]   was looking at their cell phone.
[04:45:25.080 --> 04:45:26.320]   They're just not engaged anymore.
[04:45:26.320 --> 04:45:28.560]   Everybody's attention starved.
[04:45:28.560 --> 04:45:30.600]   And the video game is one of the last mediums
[04:45:30.600 --> 04:45:33.160]   where you have undivided attention of people.
[04:45:33.160 --> 04:45:34.640]   They're really into it.
[04:45:34.640 --> 04:45:35.960]   They're all into that thing.
[04:45:35.960 --> 04:45:39.080]   And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR
[04:45:39.080 --> 04:45:42.480]   and enhanced graphics and all these new gameplay mechanics,
[04:45:42.480 --> 04:45:44.920]   it's a value add instead of a value negative.
[04:45:44.920 --> 04:45:46.040]   Because ultimately, what are you doing?
[04:45:46.040 --> 04:45:47.720]   You're telling stories
[04:45:47.720 --> 04:45:49.760]   and you're trying to connect people to something.
[04:45:49.760 --> 04:45:52.040]   Maybe it's the nature of life and death
[04:45:52.040 --> 04:45:53.520]   or are we truly real?
[04:45:53.520 --> 04:45:55.080]   Are we in a simulation or not?
[04:45:55.080 --> 04:45:57.040]   Or something like, it'd be great to do 13th floor
[04:45:57.040 --> 04:45:59.320]   as a game or something like that.
[04:45:59.320 --> 04:46:02.160]   And the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell?
[04:46:02.160 --> 04:46:04.120]   Well, you're constrained by your storytelling tools
[04:46:04.120 --> 04:46:05.240]   and technology.
[04:46:05.240 --> 04:46:07.720]   The fact that games are so much more advanced now
[04:46:07.720 --> 04:46:10.200]   means that you now have many more dimensions
[04:46:10.200 --> 04:46:12.160]   of storytelling available to you.
[04:46:12.160 --> 04:46:14.200]   And actually with AI now coming in
[04:46:14.200 --> 04:46:17.500]   and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years,
[04:46:17.500 --> 04:46:20.060]   your storytelling is not static anymore.
[04:46:20.060 --> 04:46:22.880]   The person can actually majorly participate
[04:46:22.880 --> 04:46:24.360]   and change the outcome in ways
[04:46:24.360 --> 04:46:26.280]   that were previously unpredictable.
[04:46:26.280 --> 04:46:27.720]   The other thing is they're still educational.
[04:46:27.720 --> 04:46:30.560]   You can teach people concepts that they never knew before.
[04:46:30.560 --> 04:46:32.200]   And it's like, if you wanna teach people
[04:46:32.200 --> 04:46:35.280]   about bizarre geometries or like Minecraft
[04:46:35.280 --> 04:46:36.760]   is a great example.
[04:46:36.760 --> 04:46:40.180]   A lot of people learned how computers work from Redstone.
[04:46:40.180 --> 04:46:41.800]   Think about that.
[04:46:41.800 --> 04:46:42.640]   It's true.
[04:46:42.640 --> 04:46:43.960]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[04:46:43.960 --> 04:46:45.880]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah, as we said,
[04:46:45.880 --> 04:46:47.440]   we're more and more going to be living
[04:46:47.440 --> 04:46:50.240]   in the video game worlds might as well,
[04:46:50.240 --> 04:46:52.900]   sort of as opposed to just make it fun,
[04:46:52.900 --> 04:46:57.120]   also expand our knowledge, expand our ability to think,
[04:46:57.120 --> 04:47:02.280]   explore different ideas and do education broadly defined
[04:47:02.280 --> 04:47:03.700]   within those video game worlds.
[04:47:03.700 --> 04:47:05.040]   So we do the entirety,
[04:47:05.040 --> 04:47:08.160]   the entirety of life in the video game worlds.
[04:47:08.160 --> 04:47:11.200]   Hopefully it doesn't look like Minecraft, but we'll see.
[04:47:11.200 --> 04:47:13.600]   Do you have advice for young people today,
[04:47:13.600 --> 04:47:15.600]   aside from playing lots of video games,
[04:47:15.600 --> 04:47:19.040]   high schoolers, college students,
[04:47:19.040 --> 04:47:22.040]   thinking about their career, thinking about life?
[04:47:22.040 --> 04:47:24.680]   - Well, we no longer live in a world
[04:47:24.680 --> 04:47:25.800]   where you get one skill set,
[04:47:25.800 --> 04:47:28.280]   you do it for 40 years and retire.
[04:47:28.280 --> 04:47:30.360]   I mean, that ship has sailed a long time ago.
[04:47:30.360 --> 04:47:33.320]   So learn how to learn and learn an appreciation
[04:47:33.320 --> 04:47:34.600]   and love for learning.
[04:47:34.600 --> 04:47:36.080]   So that's the first thing.
[04:47:36.080 --> 04:47:37.720]   Josh Waitzkins wrote this beautiful book,
[04:47:37.720 --> 04:47:39.880]   "The Art of Learning" if you ever read it.
[04:47:39.880 --> 04:47:41.440]   Stuff like that.
[04:47:41.520 --> 04:47:44.760]   So good study skills, slip box notes, these things,
[04:47:44.760 --> 04:47:48.080]   what was it, Zettelkasten or whatever it is.
[04:47:48.080 --> 04:47:49.480]   Yeah, there's a lot of little techniques
[04:47:49.480 --> 04:47:50.920]   that you can pick up along the way.
[04:47:50.920 --> 04:47:52.640]   And basically they teach you how to process
[04:47:52.640 --> 04:47:55.240]   lots of information very quickly, retain it,
[04:47:55.240 --> 04:47:58.320]   and then decide what's useful to you for that moment.
[04:47:58.320 --> 04:48:00.600]   The second thing is do not undervalue EQ,
[04:48:00.600 --> 04:48:01.780]   emotional intelligence.
[04:48:01.780 --> 04:48:03.880]   We've lived for a long time in a society
[04:48:03.880 --> 04:48:06.000]   where IQ was dominant.
[04:48:06.000 --> 04:48:08.920]   It's like how smart you are excuses everything else.
[04:48:08.920 --> 04:48:10.640]   You could be a horrible human being,
[04:48:10.640 --> 04:48:12.600]   but he's a really bright guy, right?
[04:48:12.600 --> 04:48:15.320]   The asshole mathematician or physicist.
[04:48:15.320 --> 04:48:17.200]   We now live in a world where the balance
[04:48:17.200 --> 04:48:18.600]   is far more important.
[04:48:18.600 --> 04:48:21.620]   You have to be smart, but you also have to be a nice guy.
[04:48:21.620 --> 04:48:22.960]   And don't undervalue that.
[04:48:22.960 --> 04:48:25.040]   So learn things like closed circuit communication
[04:48:25.040 --> 04:48:26.440]   and active listening.
[04:48:26.440 --> 04:48:29.960]   These skill sets will always pay enormous dividends
[04:48:29.960 --> 04:48:31.400]   along the way.
[04:48:31.400 --> 04:48:33.280]   Third, remember that you're judged for the things
[04:48:33.280 --> 04:48:35.240]   that you have and what you do with those things.
[04:48:35.240 --> 04:48:36.720]   You know, if you have very little,
[04:48:36.720 --> 04:48:37.800]   you still have to do something.
[04:48:37.800 --> 04:48:39.640]   When you have a lot, you have to do even more.
[04:48:39.640 --> 04:48:43.200]   So learn how to give and do that early on.
[04:48:43.200 --> 04:48:45.960]   Learn how to give back, volunteerism, charity,
[04:48:45.960 --> 04:48:48.120]   mentoring, these types of things.
[04:48:48.120 --> 04:48:51.300]   Those are so incredibly valuable to a person's development.
[04:48:51.300 --> 04:48:53.360]   The people that you mentored in the academic world,
[04:48:53.360 --> 04:48:55.340]   you learn this, you have graduate students.
[04:48:55.340 --> 04:48:58.160]   They one day will be professors.
[04:48:58.160 --> 04:49:00.680]   And it might just so happen they might eclipse you.
[04:49:00.680 --> 04:49:02.980]   Remember, Gauss had a doctoral advisor.
[04:49:02.980 --> 04:49:05.120]   Never forget that.
[04:49:05.120 --> 04:49:08.100]   And so did Feynman.
[04:49:08.100 --> 04:49:10.440]   Make sure that you mentor people, you give back,
[04:49:10.440 --> 04:49:12.680]   and you learn how to learn, and you learn how to teach.
[04:49:12.680 --> 04:49:15.120]   Super important for your development as a person.
[04:49:15.120 --> 04:49:16.980]   Now you'll notice all those things are agnostic
[04:49:16.980 --> 04:49:19.080]   to whatever domain you happen to have chosen.
[04:49:19.080 --> 04:49:21.200]   You could be in medicine or law or technology,
[04:49:21.200 --> 04:49:22.760]   whatever, that's your fancy,
[04:49:22.760 --> 04:49:24.920]   whatever your passion happens to be.
[04:49:24.920 --> 04:49:27.800]   And don't conflate your earning and your career.
[04:49:27.800 --> 04:49:30.760]   If people try to keep putting these things together,
[04:49:30.760 --> 04:49:32.760]   they're increasingly becoming decoupled.
[04:49:32.760 --> 04:49:34.800]   There's a lot of cases where people do their passions
[04:49:34.800 --> 04:49:37.780]   and they do it for free or for sustenance,
[04:49:37.780 --> 04:49:39.560]   but then they have something else they do on the side
[04:49:39.560 --> 04:49:41.800]   to also augment or supplement their income.
[04:49:41.800 --> 04:49:43.520]   Probably best that way.
[04:49:43.520 --> 04:49:44.820]   When you conflate the two,
[04:49:44.820 --> 04:49:46.600]   you tend to get burnt out terribly.
[04:49:46.600 --> 04:49:49.120]   You see this a lot with musicians or other people.
[04:49:49.120 --> 04:49:50.480]   They just, they wanna make music,
[04:49:50.480 --> 04:49:51.800]   but they have to tour or whatever
[04:49:51.800 --> 04:49:53.280]   'cause they gotta pay bills.
[04:49:53.280 --> 04:49:54.920]   Stuff like that happens.
[04:49:54.920 --> 04:49:57.280]   Other than that, I mean, I'm not a guru.
[04:49:57.280 --> 04:49:59.200]   I'm not in any particular position.
[04:49:59.200 --> 04:50:00.320]   - You showed up in a robe,
[04:50:00.320 --> 04:50:01.760]   which I thought was kinda weird.
[04:50:01.760 --> 04:50:04.280]   And you had a crown and you kept calling yourself king.
[04:50:04.280 --> 04:50:06.400]   - (laughs) King of the rats.
[04:50:06.400 --> 04:50:08.300]   And that wasn't a robe, that was a yukata.
[04:50:08.300 --> 04:50:09.940]   - Okay, thank you for clarifying.
[04:50:09.940 --> 04:50:11.580]   - Wait, audience, he's joking.
[04:50:11.580 --> 04:50:12.580]   (Lex laughs)
[04:50:12.580 --> 04:50:13.420]   Reddit.
[04:50:13.420 --> 04:50:14.980]   (Lex laughs)
[04:50:14.980 --> 04:50:17.540]   - I heard somebody's gonna write blog posts.
[04:50:17.540 --> 04:50:20.060]   Charles Hoskinson walks around with a crown.
[04:50:20.060 --> 04:50:23.460]   Let me ask you a ridiculously big
[04:50:23.460 --> 04:50:24.860]   and the most important question.
[04:50:24.860 --> 04:50:28.140]   What's the meaning of this whole thing of life?
[04:50:28.140 --> 04:50:29.300]   - Well, I got a story for that.
[04:50:29.300 --> 04:50:31.620]   (Lex laughs)
[04:50:31.620 --> 04:50:33.860]   - Does this have something to do with a farm?
[04:50:33.860 --> 04:50:34.700]   - Well, no, no, no.
[04:50:34.700 --> 04:50:35.520]   It's from Japan.
[04:50:35.520 --> 04:50:36.360]   I used to live in Japan.
[04:50:36.360 --> 04:50:38.860]   In Osaka, right next to Namba.
[04:50:38.860 --> 04:50:39.700]   Beautiful area.
[04:50:39.700 --> 04:50:41.340]   It's like, if you're gonna live anywhere in Japan,
[04:50:41.340 --> 04:50:42.180]   live in Osaka.
[04:50:42.180 --> 04:50:43.220]   You live anywhere in Osaka,
[04:50:43.220 --> 04:50:44.580]   live next to the restaurant district.
[04:50:44.580 --> 04:50:47.220]   At four o'clock in the morning, you can get good ramen.
[04:50:47.220 --> 04:50:50.620]   These are the things in life that make you who you are.
[04:50:50.620 --> 04:50:54.340]   So there was a shogun and he was kind of a badass.
[04:50:54.340 --> 04:50:55.900]   He was really good killing people,
[04:50:55.900 --> 04:50:57.300]   really good at running his empire.
[04:50:57.300 --> 04:50:59.940]   And then he got a bit disgruntled in his late 40s.
[04:50:59.940 --> 04:51:02.220]   And he said, "You know, I'm just gonna give it all
[04:51:02.220 --> 04:51:04.760]   "to my son and I'm gonna wander around Japan
[04:51:04.760 --> 04:51:07.100]   "until I find the perfect cherry blossom.
[04:51:07.100 --> 04:51:08.460]   "That's what I'm gonna do."
[04:51:08.460 --> 04:51:09.740]   Everybody thought he went crazy.
[04:51:09.740 --> 04:51:11.100]   He said, "No, no, no, that's what I'm gonna do."
[04:51:11.100 --> 04:51:12.620]   And he took his whole entourage with him.
[04:51:12.620 --> 04:51:14.700]   And so his son is now the shogun.
[04:51:14.700 --> 04:51:16.700]   And then he's just wandering throughout Japan
[04:51:16.700 --> 04:51:18.980]   and having all these incredible, crazy adventures
[04:51:18.980 --> 04:51:20.300]   as he's wandering throughout Japan.
[04:51:20.300 --> 04:51:21.700]   You know, fighting bandits
[04:51:21.700 --> 04:51:24.260]   and loving beautiful women and so forth.
[04:51:24.260 --> 04:51:26.860]   And then 30 years later,
[04:51:26.860 --> 04:51:28.860]   he's passing these two geisha gals
[04:51:28.860 --> 04:51:31.060]   and one of them turns around
[04:51:31.060 --> 04:51:33.940]   and they notice him slumped over next to a cherry tree.
[04:51:33.940 --> 04:51:37.740]   And so she goes over to try to rouse him and he's dead.
[04:51:37.740 --> 04:51:40.440]   And in his hands is a wilted cherry blossom.
[04:51:40.440 --> 04:51:43.880]   So that's a very Japanese story, right?
[04:51:43.880 --> 04:51:47.460]   The point is that it's not the actual blossom
[04:51:47.460 --> 04:51:49.340]   finding the perfection that matters.
[04:51:49.340 --> 04:51:52.000]   It's the things you do on a day-to-day basis.
[04:51:52.000 --> 04:51:53.560]   The places you go, the people you meet,
[04:51:53.560 --> 04:51:55.700]   the experiences you have, and the joy you take
[04:51:55.700 --> 04:51:58.460]   in the things that you do here in the moment now.
[04:51:58.460 --> 04:51:59.860]   You have to get there.
[04:51:59.860 --> 04:52:02.020]   You know, if you look at Jiro Dreams of Sushi,
[04:52:02.020 --> 04:52:03.860]   there's this guy, 70 years of his life,
[04:52:03.860 --> 04:52:05.620]   making the same damn piece of sushi
[04:52:05.620 --> 04:52:06.820]   again and again and again.
[04:52:06.820 --> 04:52:08.600]   He's the happiest guy around.
[04:52:08.600 --> 04:52:11.140]   Albert Camus in his story of Sisyphus.
[04:52:11.140 --> 04:52:12.780]   You know, Sisyphus should be miserable.
[04:52:12.780 --> 04:52:13.700]   It's the Greek curse.
[04:52:13.700 --> 04:52:15.060]   No, he's happy.
[04:52:15.060 --> 04:52:17.120]   He has total clarity of purpose.
[04:52:17.120 --> 04:52:19.820]   And every day he gets to basically roll that stone
[04:52:19.820 --> 04:52:21.660]   just a little bit better than the day before,
[04:52:21.660 --> 04:52:23.660]   a different way than the day before.
[04:52:23.660 --> 04:52:25.620]   And it's not the destination.
[04:52:25.620 --> 04:52:27.860]   It isn't getting the stone up at the top of the hill
[04:52:27.860 --> 04:52:28.700]   that matters.
[04:52:28.700 --> 04:52:31.340]   It's the fact that the act, you find that joy
[04:52:31.340 --> 04:52:33.400]   in that act, that ikigai, that way of life,
[04:52:33.400 --> 04:52:35.180]   that purpose of life.
[04:52:35.180 --> 04:52:38.060]   That I think is the closest thing a human can get
[04:52:38.060 --> 04:52:38.940]   to a meaning.
[04:52:38.940 --> 04:52:40.940]   You're a blip.
[04:52:40.940 --> 04:52:43.660]   You know, you didn't exist.
[04:52:43.660 --> 04:52:44.860]   You're dead.
[04:52:44.860 --> 04:52:47.780]   And if you compare it to the size of the universe
[04:52:47.780 --> 04:52:49.700]   in that time, it's just a little blip.
[04:52:49.700 --> 04:52:51.840]   So all you can do with what you have
[04:52:51.840 --> 04:52:53.620]   is just find meaning in the things that you do
[04:52:53.620 --> 04:52:54.580]   on a daily basis.
[04:52:54.580 --> 04:52:56.460]   And you can't predict the macro.
[04:52:56.460 --> 04:52:58.380]   We have all this wealth and power in America.
[04:52:58.380 --> 04:52:59.980]   What if a world war breaks out?
[04:52:59.980 --> 04:53:02.700]   We could be destitute, like Weimar Germany.
[04:53:02.700 --> 04:53:04.740]   And so you could be a big guy.
[04:53:04.740 --> 04:53:07.120]   You could be now living on the street side.
[04:53:07.120 --> 04:53:08.540]   Would you be miserable?
[04:53:08.540 --> 04:53:10.240]   The point of life is getting to a point
[04:53:10.240 --> 04:53:11.740]   that no matter what comes your way,
[04:53:11.740 --> 04:53:13.720]   what misfortune comes your way,
[04:53:13.720 --> 04:53:16.120]   you're in a position where you can find a modicum
[04:53:16.120 --> 04:53:19.680]   of happiness and love and empathy for others
[04:53:19.680 --> 04:53:21.460]   in that moment.
[04:53:21.460 --> 04:53:23.180]   And then the highest pursuit of life
[04:53:23.180 --> 04:53:25.920]   is the ability to share that mindset with other people
[04:53:25.920 --> 04:53:27.760]   and give it to them somehow.
[04:53:27.760 --> 04:53:29.560]   And that's really hard, you know,
[04:53:29.560 --> 04:53:30.920]   'cause everybody comes to you, they're always,
[04:53:30.920 --> 04:53:33.180]   "Oh, doom and gloom and cynical,
[04:53:33.180 --> 04:53:35.600]   "but this and that, a reputation this and that."
[04:53:35.600 --> 04:53:37.280]   You have to somehow transcend all of it and say,
[04:53:37.280 --> 04:53:38.780]   "You know, that doesn't matter.
[04:53:38.780 --> 04:53:40.160]   "Look at the cherry blossoms.
[04:53:40.160 --> 04:53:41.420]   "Aren't they beautiful today?
[04:53:41.420 --> 04:53:43.360]   "And let's find a better one tomorrow."
[04:53:43.360 --> 04:53:48.440]   - See, you're also a fan of fishing, I read somewhere.
[04:53:48.440 --> 04:53:51.160]   And one of my favorite books is "Old Man and the Sea,"
[04:53:51.160 --> 04:53:57.360]   where there's an old man sort of battling a big fish
[04:53:58.360 --> 04:54:01.520]   and basically closing out the last chapter of his life
[04:54:01.520 --> 04:54:02.900]   in this battle.
[04:54:02.900 --> 04:54:06.120]   So I think another aspect of life with this boulder,
[04:54:06.120 --> 04:54:08.000]   it feels like the boulder gets bigger and bigger
[04:54:08.000 --> 04:54:11.000]   as we get closer to death.
[04:54:11.000 --> 04:54:15.280]   And you find yourself married to a particular struggle
[04:54:15.280 --> 04:54:20.840]   in life that eventually just kind of overtakes
[04:54:20.840 --> 04:54:23.680]   the entirety of meaning of your existence.
[04:54:23.680 --> 04:54:26.280]   Do you think, I know what it is for me,
[04:54:26.280 --> 04:54:27.880]   do you have something like that?
[04:54:28.560 --> 04:54:32.480]   The broader vision that unites your work with Cardano
[04:54:32.480 --> 04:54:34.200]   and everything you've done in life,
[04:54:34.200 --> 04:54:36.640]   the big fish that you're going to end up
[04:54:36.640 --> 04:54:40.120]   in the dark of night struggling with
[04:54:40.120 --> 04:54:42.240]   at the end, the last chapter of your life,
[04:54:42.240 --> 04:54:44.140]   like the big problem you're taking on?
[04:54:44.140 --> 04:54:48.040]   - Well, in mathematics, it was the Goldbach conjecture.
[04:54:48.040 --> 04:54:48.880]   I'd like to prove that.
[04:54:48.880 --> 04:54:50.680]   (laughing)
[04:54:50.680 --> 04:54:51.520]   That's probably not gonna happen.
[04:54:51.520 --> 04:54:53.200]   - That's a really big fish.
[04:54:53.200 --> 04:54:54.920]   So do you still have a love for mathematics?
[04:54:54.920 --> 04:54:57.040]   - Oh God, yeah, of course I do.
[04:54:57.040 --> 04:54:58.800]   You never lose that, you never lose it.
[04:54:58.800 --> 04:55:00.880]   You lose the ability to do deep work
[04:55:00.880 --> 04:55:04.080]   and you don't have the creativity and the raw inspiration.
[04:55:04.080 --> 04:55:06.040]   This is why I've gotten to automated theorem proving
[04:55:06.040 --> 04:55:08.600]   'cause what I lack in, 'cause I'm getting older,
[04:55:08.600 --> 04:55:10.120]   I can now have computers understand it
[04:55:10.120 --> 04:55:11.820]   and use AI to just solve this stuff.
[04:55:11.820 --> 04:55:13.960]   It's like the cheat codes for math.
[04:55:13.960 --> 04:55:16.520]   Fuck those guys, we'll still do that.
[04:55:16.520 --> 04:55:19.080]   But yeah, mathematics still has those last passions
[04:55:19.080 --> 04:55:20.800]   and there's all kinds of cool things
[04:55:20.800 --> 04:55:22.280]   that I'd like to see done.
[04:55:22.280 --> 04:55:24.880]   Like quota complexes allow you to unify topology
[04:55:24.880 --> 04:55:26.600]   and number theory in really novel ways
[04:55:26.600 --> 04:55:29.040]   and there are all kinds of cool things, but who cares?
[04:55:29.040 --> 04:55:31.300]   (laughing)
[04:55:31.300 --> 04:55:34.400]   Everybody has those white whales.
[04:55:34.400 --> 04:55:37.040]   Another thing I love to do is bring back the woolly mammoth.
[04:55:37.040 --> 04:55:39.240]   You know, that's George Church's hidden pleasure.
[04:55:39.240 --> 04:55:41.200]   In five to 10 years, it's actually gonna happen.
[04:55:41.200 --> 04:55:42.760]   And I have this beautiful ranch in Wyoming
[04:55:42.760 --> 04:55:44.440]   and I gotta find a way to convince George
[04:55:44.440 --> 04:55:47.600]   to let me raise his clone mammoth fence on my ranch.
[04:55:47.600 --> 04:55:48.420]   - Among the bison.
[04:55:48.420 --> 04:55:50.800]   - Among the bison, they'd probably get along really well.
[04:55:50.800 --> 04:55:52.440]   And then I have to learn all these cool things
[04:55:52.440 --> 04:55:54.600]   about woolly mammoths, like do you shave them
[04:55:54.600 --> 04:55:56.320]   in the summertime and let them get shaggy
[04:55:56.320 --> 04:55:58.080]   during the winter or do you just let that coat go
[04:55:58.080 --> 04:56:00.320]   and then fall, who knows?
[04:56:00.320 --> 04:56:02.040]   It's an undiscovered country.
[04:56:02.040 --> 04:56:05.000]   - I just had the image of Charles Hoskinson alone
[04:56:05.000 --> 04:56:09.600]   on a bison farm trying to raise a woolly mammoth.
[04:56:09.600 --> 04:56:10.800]   - Just start wearing a white suit
[04:56:10.800 --> 04:56:13.080]   and say, "Welcome to Hoskinson's Ranch."
[04:56:13.080 --> 04:56:14.640]   I'll have a cane with amber on it.
[04:56:14.640 --> 04:56:17.120]   - Yeah, with a chalkboard that you keep scrambling on
[04:56:17.120 --> 04:56:20.000]   like the beautiful mind in the movie
[04:56:20.000 --> 04:56:20.840]   and you'll have voices talking to you.
[04:56:20.840 --> 04:56:22.480]   - Oh, the schizophrenia's already come.
[04:56:22.480 --> 04:56:25.440]   You guys are all figments of my imagination anyway.
[04:56:25.440 --> 04:56:27.960]   Now, one of my goals though, I love catfish
[04:56:27.960 --> 04:56:28.940]   and they live a long time.
[04:56:28.940 --> 04:56:31.040]   They get really damn big if you see those guys.
[04:56:31.040 --> 04:56:33.560]   I'd love to catch one now and be in my 60s
[04:56:33.560 --> 04:56:36.560]   and catch the same fish twice and recognize it.
[04:56:36.560 --> 04:56:38.240]   Maybe I'll lift a scar or something.
[04:56:38.240 --> 04:56:41.080]   That'd be really cool, going back to the fish thing.
[04:56:41.080 --> 04:56:42.880]   'Cause both the fish has gone through a lot,
[04:56:42.880 --> 04:56:44.840]   I've gone through a lot, we can just be like old friends.
[04:56:44.840 --> 04:56:45.680]   - Reminisce.
[04:56:45.680 --> 04:56:47.360]   - Exactly, exactly.
[04:56:47.360 --> 04:56:50.240]   And then I'll die of a heart attack
[04:56:50.240 --> 04:56:51.640]   and my mammoths will eat me.
[04:56:51.640 --> 04:56:53.440]   - That's something to look forward to.
[04:56:53.440 --> 04:56:56.320]   Charles, this was one of the most amazing conversations
[04:56:56.320 --> 04:56:57.160]   I've ever had.
[04:56:57.160 --> 04:56:59.680]   It's truly an honor that you would spend
[04:56:59.680 --> 04:57:01.360]   your valuable time with me.
[04:57:01.360 --> 04:57:03.560]   And I'm glad you exist in the cryptocurrency
[04:57:03.560 --> 04:57:04.680]   and the technology space.
[04:57:04.680 --> 04:57:06.840]   And I can see your love for mathematics
[04:57:06.840 --> 04:57:08.480]   and your love for life just radiate
[04:57:08.480 --> 04:57:09.320]   through everything you do.
[04:57:09.320 --> 04:57:11.040]   So thank you for being you
[04:57:11.040 --> 04:57:12.880]   and thank you for talking to me today.
[04:57:12.880 --> 04:57:13.720]   - This was a lot of fun.
[04:57:13.720 --> 04:57:15.640]   Thank you so much, Lex.
[04:57:15.640 --> 04:57:17.080]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:57:17.080 --> 04:57:18.320]   with Charles Hoskinson.
[04:57:18.320 --> 04:57:23.320]   And thank you to Gala Games, Allform, Indeed, ExpressVPN,
[04:57:23.560 --> 04:57:25.000]   and Aidsleep.
[04:57:25.000 --> 04:57:28.520]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[04:57:28.520 --> 04:57:30.800]   And now let me leave you with some words
[04:57:30.800 --> 04:57:32.640]   from William Faulkner.
[04:57:32.640 --> 04:57:35.280]   "You cannot swim for new horizons
[04:57:35.280 --> 04:57:39.240]   "until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore."
[04:57:39.240 --> 04:57:42.000]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[04:57:42.000 --> 04:57:44.580]   (upbeat music)
[04:57:44.580 --> 04:57:47.160]   (upbeat music)
[04:57:47.160 --> 04:57:57.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
