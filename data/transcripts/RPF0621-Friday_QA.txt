[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance. It's live Q&A.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.160]   The show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show we do live Q&A.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:09.640]   I
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:25.600]   answer,,,,aren
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:03.400]   beyond
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.660]   was a double

[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.340]   a company here. They, what they do is they distress
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340]   mortgage notes. They, you know, they're, they have their
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.340]   own funds, a good return somewhere about 10 to 14%
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.340]   annually. But when I asked them if they have a Roth account,
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.340]   they said that they don't have a custodial. And, and my
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.340]   question to you is that, you know, if you know, if you know
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.360]   that you're going to have a custodial account, what would
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   be the best way to do that?
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   You know, I think that's a good question. I think that's
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   the best way to do that. I think that's a good question.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   You know, I think that's a good question. I think that's
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   the best way to do that. I think that's a good question.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   You know, I think that's a good question. I think that's

[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:16.480]   Summit I have taken the tour. I have a business that you have. You have a sweep.

[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:24.400]   I'm pretty sure there's wiring fees involved, but other than that, is there, are they all pretty much the same?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:45.480]   No, they're not pretty much the same. So you will need to research the fees and definitely there will be fees. They're not going to work for free. Nobody works for free and they shouldn't work for free. And if anyone tells you they're working for free, run away because they're not. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. I've heard economists say you can figure out any about anything you need to know by asking someone if they believe
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   They're such a thing as a free lunch.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:07:14.460]  , but what's the acronym they like? Panstaffel. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. So you just need to understand what those fees are and how they're going to be charged and assessed. And the fees will range from sales fees, commissions, they're selling the notes on a specific flat rate or a spread of some kind. The fees will range to all of the account fees. So what are they going to charge you for account custodianship? What are they going to charge you for wiring fees?
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.460]   You'll also pay fees to your custodianship.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.460]   You'll also pay fees to your custodianship.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.460]   You'll also pay fees to your custodianship.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.500]   So you'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   You'll pay fees for their servicing on the bank accounts that are associated with it.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   You'll pay fees for their servicing on the bank accounts that are associated with it.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   So yes, you will pay fees.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   You will pay fees.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   You just need to calculate those fees, understand what they are, and then make sure that you are still going to have a higher expected rate of return even when those fees are calculated in compared to your alternative investments.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   You will pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.500]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:08:10.540]  , you'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.540]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.540]   You'll pay fees for them to hold the Roth IRA with them.

[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.140]   yeah
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.260]   care get Gud
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.000]   about, and,,,,, have Ï„Î¿ Traditionalricia
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:39.560]   Pro
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:09:10.500]  asons to get to the top of the list. So I am, you know, mid thirties, I have MBAs and I have slight desire. Well, I was teeter totter between if I should pursue a CFA. I have, like I said, I have an MBA, but it'd be more just for my own. I don't have any desire to get into asset management necessarily. My actual more interest is probably more on the like personal finance side of this investing kind of thing.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:30.580]   saving and more of the fire community, but I do like understanding the investments. And so I just thought I'd get your opinion on on taking something like that on. I know, obviously, it takes a lot of hours and a lot of money as well. So I don't know any any thoughts.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:39.480]   Could you ever see yourself using it? Meaning would this be a backup career for you in case you lost your your existing career? Could you ever see any
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   professional use for the career?
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   could you ever see any professional use for the career?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:10:08.460]  , I mean, there's some scenarios where maybe it plays out, but I guess yeah, when I say that at the moment, I don't have any any desire right now to go run into asset management or any change it would be but if given my background and things that I've done in the past with being in a corporate development role and stuff like that, I could see myself maybe leveraging that in the future if the opportunity arose.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:08.460]   But I think I would say that I would be a good opportunity to take that and I would take that as well as well as well as I can.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:19.280]   Without if you are doing just engaging in self study without pursuing a specific degree, are you effective at teaching yourself the knowledge that you want to learn?
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   Or do you need the structure of a degree program to keep you accountable?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.360]   That's that's part of the problem.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:33.440]   I think I think it is helpful to have a degree program or I kind of get a little bit of, you know, what's the point sort of thing.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   So having the targets and stuff like that, that's a good thing.

[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   The other thing is that you would have to have enough in your investment portfolio that your earnings from that portfolio are in excess of your earned income and that's hard to do.

[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:37.920]  ,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   So that's my argument, you know, without the numbers behind it.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   So that's my argument, you know, without the numbers behind it.

[00:33:37.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   I think they're common sense arguments,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   I think they're common sense arguments,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   I think they're common sense arguments,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   which means that in general,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   I think it's a mistake for people who have the option
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   to contribute to a Roth 401k.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   And I think it's better for them to contribute to a traditional 401k.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   And if they want to do after they've done traditional 401k contributions,
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:37.960]   I think it's better for them to contribute to a traditional 401k contribution
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   because then you get the benefits of it actually being on the IRA,
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   not in the 401k.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   Okay, great.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   Good question.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   Anything else you want to add, David?
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   No, I think that takes care of me. Thank you.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   My pleasure.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   Before I go on to another question, just one more example for you. I know that my own commentary is often inflammatory because if you believe what politicians say, if you believe they're serious about it, then probably my commentary is often inflammatory because if you believe what politicians say, if you believe they're serious about it, then probably my commentary is often inflammatory because if you believe they're serious about it, then probably my commentary is often inflammatory because if you believe they're serious about it,
