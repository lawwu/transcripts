[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   J Cal looks like he's going to a night at the Roxbury.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.680]   Absolutely.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.680]   He looks like Joe Pesci.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.640]   Here we go.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.000]   He's like Joe Pesci.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   Is it Joe Pesci?
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.680]   I'm a joke?
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.520]   Sorry, my life's skipped.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.360]   I mean, you look horrible.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.080]   Thank you.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.680]   Absolutely fucking horrible.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.560]   Okay, appreciate it.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.000]   Is that your MC outfit or what?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.480]   Here we go.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.640]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.520]   Rain Man, David Sack.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400]   And instead, we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.880]   Love you guys.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   I'm the queen of kinwa.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.920]   Thanks for coming.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.320]   This is the Production Board Symposium 2021.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.360]   Tell us just a little bit about why we're here, David, and what this is and what it
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.960]   represents for the Production Board.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   The Production Board Symposium, second ever.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.480]   Thank you all for being here.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.440]   We're excited.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.760]   We have an amazing group of...
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   Science, scientists, engineers, folks from academia, from business, from the investing
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.400]   community, some of our investors.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.760]   We're excited to share thoughts and ideas over the next couple days and thought we would
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.560]   chase half of you away by hosting the All In Pod tonight.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.480]   Here we go.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.360]   Great.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   Okay, so first up in the news, Rolling Stone amplifies false ivermectin story.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560]   You were following this, Chamath.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.040]   What do you think this ivermectin...
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.040]   ...controversy and...
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.680]   Do you want to give a little summary of what the issue is before we talk about the
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.560]   hypocrisy of it?
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.480]   Well, on September 1st, Oklahoma news station K4 ran a story and published an article
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.200]   on ivermectin overdoses backing up rural hospitals.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.240]   The article was titled Patients Overdosing on Ivermectin Backing Up Rural Oklahoma Hospital,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.800]   Hospitals and Ambulances.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   First line of the article, quote, "A rural hospital is a rural hospital.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.040]   A rural Oklahoma doctor said patients who are taking the home dewormer medication, ivermectin,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.160]   to fight COVID-19 are causing emergency rooms and ambulances to back up."
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.680]   On September 3rd, Rolling Stone amplified the story in its own article.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.320]   The only problem was they treated...
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.080]   They tweeted it with a picture that featured people lined up in the cold.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.560]   It turns out the picture was people waiting for vaccine shots back in January, not gunshot,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   and they were waiting for the vaccine shots to be delivered.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.600]   The story is totally false.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.480]   You understand that, right?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.800]   Well, I didn't want to say fake news, but I know...
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.520]   No, it was beyond fake news.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.400]   This was basically a doctored-up, conjured article by some person trying to incite a
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   moral mania at Rolling Stone.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.600]   Look, you tell me if the science of this is wrong.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.920]   The whole premise is ridiculous.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.440]   So, ivermectin basically, as far as we know, because we don't know that much, acts on a
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.000]   handful of...
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.240]   Specific characteristics.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   One we know to be glutamate, which we don't really express in the same way as like fucking
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.800]   worms.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.680]   So, yes, technically it can be used as a dewormer, but there are four or five other ways in which
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.360]   it acts, which we don't know anything about because we haven't taken the time to do a
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.040]   broad-based, double-blind study.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   I think the fairest thing to say about ivermectin is we don't know what it is.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.160]   Neither the people that propose to use it as a solution for COVID, nor the people that
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.440]   rail against it aren't really...
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.600]   Really starting from the basis of fact.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.920]   But then what happens is you have these folks who basically are so turned off by the idea
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.880]   that people aren't getting vaccines, they're going to use this other thing.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.720]   They basically doctor it up an article.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.360]   That wouldn't be so bad because nobody reads Rolling Stone.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960]   It's kind of a...
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.280]   It's an ancient brand.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.360]   It's an ancient brand.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.000]   Nobody's going there for medical news.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.200]   Nobody reads it.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   But then the problem is you get a handful of these folks who think they're really, really
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.840]   smart who amplify it.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.200]   Rachel Maddow amplifies it.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.380]   Jimmy Kimmel does it on a comedy series.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.720]   And then all of a sudden there's this enormous outrage.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.120]   But the problem is you can't put the genie back in the bottle when it turns out to be
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.720]   a completely fabricated lie.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.840]   And then all the people that are purporting to basically push this lie who now have been
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.720]   outed have no consequences because they're on the left screaming at the right.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.200]   And what happened when it was the other way around, we basically started to put people
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.760]   in boxes.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.560]   We basically kicked them off these platforms.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.760]   And again, so you have this compounding building double standard.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.120]   That to me is the worst part about it.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.640]   David, when we look at the Ivermectin story, we also saw Joe Rogan got COVID. That was a big
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.600]   "ha-ha" moment for a lot of people. And he took Ivermectin as part of his treatment,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   and then people started amplifying that he was taking a worm drug for horses.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.320]   Dewormer.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.840]   Dewormer. Andâ€”
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.680]   It's, at best, an antimicrobial.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.000]   Right. And it's used for both situations,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.320]   and a doctor prescribed it to him. He's thinking of suing some folks for treating this. What does
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.640]   this overall say about the state of communications around this pandemic?
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.320]   Yeah, I mean, look, this is really a media story. You had Rolling Stone publish this article based
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.280]   on a single source. You have this one crank basically saying that emergency rooms are
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.560]   turning away gunshot victims and people having heart attacks, okay? And all they had to do,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.720]   all Rolling Stone had to do was call up any one of these several hospitals, they immediately would
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.080]   have refuted the source. But they didn't do that. They also could have simply Googled
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   the name of the hospital. They could have simply Googled the name of the hospital.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   They could have simply Googled the name of the hospital. They could have simply Googled the
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   name of the hospital. They could have simply Googled the name of the hospital. They could have simply
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   Googled the name of the hospital. They could have simply Googled the name of the hospital. They could
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.280]   the number of toxic ivermectin cases to find out if it was even plausible statistically
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.560]   that you could have ivermectin overdoses flooding oklahoma hospitals but they didn't do that either
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.200]   why didn't they confirm the sources because the article was too perfect it confirmed all of their
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.880]   priors their first prior was about ivermectin they've been waging this war on ivermectin
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.400]   claiming it's a horse dewormer when it's actually that is one of its purposes but it's not the only
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.920]   one it was a it was a drug designed for humans and it's used against parasites now as jamas said
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.880]   we don't know whether it's effective against covid they got to do the double blind studies
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.360]   and we'll find out but that was sort of their first prior and let's face it the second prior
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.520]   was that this is in oklahoma right and so rolling stone wants to believe you have
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.720]   all these mega idiots out in oklahoma eating horse paste okay and that's why
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.600]   they love this story so much and that's why rachel maddow loved the story so much and she then starts
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.880]   spreading it okay and after she gets called out including by say glenn greenwald as of last night
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.240]   she had not taken it down now why because she knows there are no consequences for misinformation
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.760]   and lying why because twitter and facebook do not punish people on the left for misinformation
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.640]   that is sub penalty they only meter out for people who disagree with their cultural and
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.200]   political biases she's not part of the secret cabal that gets the get out of jail free card
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.520]   i don't i don't even think it's secret i just think these people all are part of the same
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.440]   cultural sort of milieu they all have the same political and cultural biases and there is never
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.200]   look where is the twitter warning the twitter label on the rachel maddow post even now saying
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   that this tweet this article is misinformation uh it doesn't exist because it's inconvenient
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.440]   freebird let's talk about the science of i think i would pay 40 for all in podcast live it's dynamic
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   it works yeah by the way you're on the show so okay i'm here too um tell me the live
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.880]   live is the last time we heard a news story that didn't have bias to it what was the last general
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.680]   thing that was reported that we didn't feel had the angle that then elicited emotion either love
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.800]   or hate or alignment or not um you can have that reaction to facts there was an article in the
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.760]   wall street journal just now about like the the democrats proposal on taxes i have an emotional
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.640]   reaction to it but it's fact-based i've got a hundred is it really was it my reaction or no the
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.360]   story
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.640]   yeah they just said that they the the house proposal now is to move the cap gains rate to
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.840]   from 20 to 25 the corporate tax rate from whatever it was to 26 and a half but it's it my point is
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.280]   there are articles written by folks who just want to get the facts across and let you judge whether
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.600]   it's good or bad who knows time will tell then there are folks that basically manufacture because
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.280]   again i think and i think it's matt taibi that said this because it creates moral mania and they want
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.840]   to drive drives the narrative drive the emotion but it's the last grasp of power of journalism
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.320]   that's all they have left at this point is just to basically make it a complete free-for-all
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.480]   and in it they still have some kind of relevancy i have these old new york times
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.600]   uh newspapers like the whole year printed from like 1936 through 1944 it's cool it's like in
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.560]   this huge book and you know but you must have been out all the time but you didn't have time
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   to read those yeah i mean but you flip through these things they're like they are they are just
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.600]   like old like ticker stories you know it had absolutely no like narrative attached to it
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.080]   there was no like these are the people almost the implicit right and wrong right the implicit
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.760]   morality of every decision that's being made of everything that's being reported on i have a
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.200]   feeling the only thing that's going to be left in like 10 years is the economist and then like
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.360]   the mob rule in the metaverse and that's kind of well i mean you also have podcasts where people
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:16.560]   can discuss these things and maybe a more um honest there's so few great podcasts like that
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.480]   mr mr anti-facebook what do you think of the podcast you're doing right now i'm not sure if
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.360]   you're doing it right now i'm not sure if you're doing it in the future but i'm not sure if you're
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.840]   doing it right now i'm not sure if you're doing it in the future but i'm not sure if you're doing it
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.240]   in the future but i'm not sure if you're doing it in the future but i'm not sure if you're doing it in the future
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.400]   a secret cabal that basically gets to get out of jail free card on facebook and nobody else does
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.480]   millions of people though that said right yeah that's a lot you work there it's exactly the
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.720]   point i've been making right which is that there's two sets of rules if you are part of the in crowd
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.920]   if you share the cultural biases if you're part of the same class whether it's you know
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.720]   socioeconomic or political or whatever that of the people who are doing the content moderation
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   doing the censorship you get a a lot of people who are part of the in crowd who are part of the in
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:48.640]   crowd who are part of the in crowd who are part of the in crowd who are part of the in crowd who are
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.520]   get out jail free card the rules are different for you you can be rachel maddow and post an article
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.120]   that's complete and even after the entire twitter sphere calls you out you don't post a correction
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.200]   but you don't get labeled you don't get censored but if you're on a different part of the political
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.120]   spectrum you do i mean there's two sets of rules yeah i mean i think i think it's insane i mean
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   this is exactly what i think people have been saying for a long time when people say oh you
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.040]   know it's algorithmic it's not really human controlled there's there's no real intervention
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.320]   and then you find out there's actually
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.680]   a lot of people who are like oh yeah you know there's a lot of people who are like oh yeah you're
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.080]   right there's no real intervention and then you find out there's actually literally something
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.120]   called cross check which its definition is check the hue you know check the algorithm and override
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.960]   it with my own bias that's the that's the definition of what the feature is well i mean it
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.400]   whenever we start down this censorship route like who gets to decide and then what is their
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.480]   motivation even if they have pure motivation there's no way to you know not but assume the
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.240]   platforms die assume everything deplatforms and decentralizes and then like all media is through
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.680]   or through other kind of media decentralized uh crypto based exactly and so twitter there's no
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.520]   longer a platform there's no longer a sensor model what's going to end up happening people are going
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.320]   to click on the stuff that they want to hear confirmation bias it's going to become more
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.480]   extreme it's going to become you know even more heated there's going to be splintering of media
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   creation as there is right now that we see today right every every element of the spectrum will
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.600]   be kind of produced and you're going to end up clicking on the stuff that creates the greatest
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.160]   emotional response because that's what people like to consume how does a citizen who wants to inoculate
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.680]   themselves from fake news bias how do you recommend they go after science and how do they
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.520]   have to learn this stuff for themselves they have to try to become an expert themselves yeah it's
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.120]   hard like anything that's hard right i mean there's got to be a will i don't think that that's
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.920]   really um it's it's not to be discouraging i just think that it's a lot easier to not do that right
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.880]   so it's a lot easier to consume ice cream all the time it's a lot more fun to consume ice cream all
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   the time and to kind of plan your diet eat healthy and work out and all this sort of stuff and i
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.080]   think that's really where you know media is going to be able to do that right so i think that's really
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.920]   where you know media is going to be able to do that right so i think that's really where you know media like a lot of things it's headed
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.000]   media like a lot of things it's headed as we create these kind of feedback loops that are
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   as we create these kind of feedback loops that are
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.440]   as we create these kind of feedback loops that are all because everything's digital everything ends
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:53.440]   all because everything's digital everything ends
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.280]   all because everything's digital everything ends up becoming its feedback i bet you
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   up becoming its feedback i bet you
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.040]   up becoming its feedback i bet you i bet you if you look inside because like now
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   i bet you i bet you if you look inside because like now
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.720]   i bet you i bet you if you look inside because like now some rabid politician will get a hold of
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   some rabid politician will get a hold of
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.200]   some rabid politician will get a hold of this facebook crosscheck thing i bet you
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   this facebook crosscheck thing i bet you
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.240]   this facebook crosscheck thing i bet you um if you look and graph the number of
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   um if you look and graph the number of
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.840]   um if you look and graph the number of people that were essentially white
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   people that were essentially white
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.360]   people that were essentially white listed from being able to say whatever
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   listed from being able to say whatever
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.800]   listed from being able to say whatever the hell they want
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   the hell they want
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   the hell they want versus what was popular on facebook
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   versus what was popular on facebook
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.160]   versus what was popular on facebook you'd see a left versus right
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   you'd see a left versus right
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.000]   you'd see a left versus right distribution very clearly
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   distribution very clearly
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.600]   distribution very clearly you'd basically see it because if you
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   you'd basically see it because if you
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.440]   you'd basically see it because if you look at it now i think there's a
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   look at it now i think there's a
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.120]   look at it now i think there's a i can't remember his name but he's a he's
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   i can't remember his name but he's a he's
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.560]   i can't remember his name but he's a he's a former new york times reporter
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   a former new york times reporter
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.320]   a former new york times reporter that tweets out every day
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   that tweets out every day
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.480]   that tweets out every day um the top 10 links that are shared on
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   um the top 10 links that are shared on
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.320]   um the top 10 links that are shared on facebook and it's like a
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   facebook and it's like a
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.960]   facebook and it's like a train wreck it's like one normal
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   train wreck it's like one normal
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.440]   train wreck it's like one normal article and then it's like nine like
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:33.440]   article and then it's like nine like
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.560]   article and then it's like nine like right-wing info wars ben shapiro
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   right-wing info wars ben shapiro
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   It's a train wreck every day. So if you're a hipster sitting in East Menlo Park,
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   at some point the cuffs in your jeans are rolled up too tight. The fucking shirt cuffs are rolled
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.640]   up too tight. You're just freaking out. Then you're like, "We need to create something.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.600]   What do we call it?" And we're like, "Cross check." And then all of a sudden what happens
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.480]   is you just start introducing people hoping that then the list that gets published every day on
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.080]   Twitter changes. But then what happens actually is you find the exact opposite thing happens.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   That people are so like they sniff out the bullshit. They're like, "What is going on here?"
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.000]   But then they double down. And the next thing you know, Ben Shapiro's eight of the 10 top
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.080]   stories every day on Facebook and that's how you have Donald Trump and everything else.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.200]   Next topic.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.880]   Go ahead.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.640]   Well, it's going to, I mean, I don't want to believe her.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.360]   They did it to themselves.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.400]   Yeah, look. I think
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.420]   you're right. I think they did it to themselves.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:32.440]   Yeah. I think they did it to themselves.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:32.480]   Yeah. I think they did it to themselves.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.920]   I think both sides are capable of, both sides of the political spectrum are capable of spreading
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   misinformation and bullshit. And you have to vary your information diet, right? I mean,
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.720]   if all you do is participate in the right wing or left wing echo chamber, you're going to buy into
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.040]   the Ivermectin hoax. You're going to be storing here from Rolling Stone or whatever it is. So,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.280]   you have to make an effort to, again, to vary your information diet.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.680]   Or masks.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.560]   But.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.600]   Or the
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.440]   lab leak theory.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.880]   The lab leak theory, exactly.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.440]   We now have five of these during the pandemic alone, right?
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.240]   Right. But see, what I object to is the fact that the censorship rules only seem to apply
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.040]   to one side of the spectrum. Look, both sides are capable of spreading misinformation,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.240]   but only one side is being censored. Why? Because the people running these powerful tech companies
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   agree. They're like, you know, 90 plus percent of that political persuasion. That is not healthy.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.440]   Can we survey the audience and see if they agree?
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:31.760]   Sure.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.600]   Raise your hand if you agree with Sachs.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.360]   How many people agree with Sachs that Trump should be reinstated on all platforms?
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:45.520]   All right, there you go. How many people agree that the tech platforms have a political bias?
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.320]   How many disagree with that statement?
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.680]   Nobody.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.080]   Interesting.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.640]   So, tell.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.760]   Phil Doit's wife is a chief business officer at Facebook. Thanks, Phil.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.080]   Tell us. Let us check you with Phil after the next vesting date.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.120]   Requisite hand wrote.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.680]   Super.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.280]   For the viewers at home who couldn't see that, because I don't know. Do we have the audience on
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:05.760]   the camera?
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.000]   No.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.560]   No.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:06.880]   Go ahead.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.400]   So, it was 99 percent.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.920]   No, everyone.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.520]   Everyone except for Phil Doit.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.480]   Well, and these are Silicon, best described as Silicon Valley.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.280]   He needs to go home to Barney, so that's why he had to raise his hand.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.720]   No, but to be clear for people listening.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.760]   Phil's wife works at Facebook.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   100 percent.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.120]   He's got it. He's got to say no. It's okay. It's okay.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.600]   99 percent.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.960]   But everybody else here agreed with that, and these are all people who are in the tech industry.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.520]   They know.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.480]   They know.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.800]   They know.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   How many of us are Democrats? I mean, we're all mostly Democrats, I would guess.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.880]   How many people voted Democrat in the last election?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.000]   How many are not Democrats?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.560]   How many people voted for Trump? Raise your hand nice and high.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.040]   No, nobody.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.840]   Raise your hand.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.800]   Nobody? No, literally, there's only... That's very interesting.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.240]   Seriously, take everyone out of here.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.600]   Here's a question I have. Okay, so we are firmly going down, because I think it's pretty clear to
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:59.360]   me, I'd be willing to make the bet, that the media is on the side of vaccine mandates. They want the
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.320]   top-down control and the sense of theoretical safety that a vaccine mandate gives them in their
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:13.280]   own little bubble, and so that's why I think they support this. I think blowing up ivermectin was a
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.080]   method of many that they've undertaken to do that, whether we believe in vaccine mandates or not.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.640]   But now it's coming. It's coming in the LA school district. Biden is trying to push this thing
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.960]   through the BLS. This is going to be a very, very big deal. What do you guys think is the right thing
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.520]   to do on vaccine mandates? What do you think is the right thing to do on vaccine mandates?
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.440]   Irrespective of all we're going to hear over the next...
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.080]   Government or private employer mandates, or both?
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.520]   Well, let's walk through it.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.160]   You're saying both?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.600]   For the government employees, let's start with that.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.520]   Well, the government mandate. No, it goes through the BLS. It says any company,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.320]   public or private, that is 100 employees or more.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.560]   Well, I mean, I think we all agree that people in the military or people in healthcare,
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.160]   they should all be vaccinated or they shouldn't come to work, correct?
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:06.240]   Well, that's also not even enforceable. Andrew Ross Sorkin tweeted out he had to take his kid to
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.040]   the urgent care. And he walked in and the doctors weren't wearing masks or something.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.840]   Yeah, I read that.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.600]   And said something about not being vaccinated, it doesn't matter, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.080]   And he like-
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.680]   Well, that goes to enforcement, but I mean-
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.400]   Moral, liberal outrage-
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.080]   The military has said you have to be-
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.440]   And I thought, wait, you brought your kid to the fucking urgent care. Don't you first need
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.760]   to know what's wrong with the kid? You can't prosecute this person's opinion on masks and
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.600]   vaccines before you figure out what's wrong with your kid.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.720]   Well, what do you think, Sachs? Military-
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.600]   Parenting, but you're not-
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   Military, healthcare, teachers.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.480]   I think the crux of the issue is whether employers should be able to require that. Well,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.280]   there's two issues. One is whether employers should be allowed to require it, which I think
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.480]   everybody agrees, not everyone, but most people I think agree that private employers,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.040]   and you could lump the government in with this, should be allowed to
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.280]   test their employees or require their employees to be vaccinated if
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.120]   they want to. Or at least I would support that part of it, is let private enterprises
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.880]   require vaccination if they want. If they decide, hey, in order to come back to the office,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.800]   you got to be vaccinated. It's for everyone's safety. They can impose those rules.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.080]   Now, the question is, do we need to go beyond that to have a federal mandate?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.240]   And it's not that I'm anti-vaccine. I just think that's like an awfully authoritarian thing to do.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.000]   And it raises a bunch of questions. So for example,
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.440]   I have a friend who owns a chain of dry cleaners. He's got over 100 employees,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.520]   mostly minimum wage in a bunch of different locations. About 20% of his employees-
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.640]   What is his ethnicity?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.600]   What does that have to do with anything?
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.160]   Just curious.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.960]   He's Sri Lankan. Anyway, so-
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.240]   He's the third most famous Sri Lankan American. Keep going.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.720]   Yes. Anyway, so he's got 100 employees. About 20% of them are anti-vax,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.640]   and they will not get vaccinated. So they will walk out if this is required.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.440]   Do another job.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.320]   Do another job. Hold on. But he can't run his business if there's a 20% walkout. He just can't
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.160]   do it. So now we get to the soft part of the mandate, which is, well, instead of requiring
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.120]   the vax, he can do a weekly test. Well, we did that outside here. Who's going to pay for those
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.000]   tests? Who's going to administer them? Is it like they had a nurse out here with the full-
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.120]   Hazmat.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.680]   Yeah, the hazmat thing. So that's not cheap. So who's going to pay for that? Who's going to do
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.320]   that? What's the documentation around that going to be? Is that get logged into the computer system?
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.960]   What kind of proof? Does it require a trip to the lab? Or is this something we can do in five
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.000]   minutes? I mean, look, if we had done what Freeberg said a year ago on this pod we should do,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.640]   which is have these $1 five-minute tests be available everywhere,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.760]   then maybe that sort of rapid test out would make these mandates more palatable. But we
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.880]   don't have that yet. There aren't enough of these things.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.320]   It turns out we still need it even with the vaccines, because no vaccine is going to be 100%
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.360]   effective. And with-
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   Right. But my point is, since we don't really have that solution operationalized, having a hard
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:12.560]   vax mandate on 100 million employees of private enterprises, that's going to cause, I think,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.760]   chaos in the economy.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:20.720]   What if we get a variant, David, or if we get a variant, God forbid, that is more dangerous than
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.280]   Delta? Let's say it's-
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.600]   Let's say it spreads just as fast, but it's five times as deadly. Does that change your thinking
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.680]   about this mandate? And where do you stand on the mandate?
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.240]   No, I think the mandate in this very specific narrow instance makes sense. And I think what
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.760]   we should be fighting about is how we actually write it so that it's not wholly expansive.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:45.040]   And the reason is because we know that there is a probabilistic distribution of outcomes where
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.800]   a non-trivial percentage of them results in a variant that is deadly. And so we can understand
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.080]   the math and we can understand a sense of time to figure out that if we don't do something,
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.640]   and if we don't get to some amount of control around what this is, we're all in really big
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:09.440]   trouble. So because of that specific thing, I just think this is where, look, the president
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   has the ability to invoke the War Measures Act to do all kinds of things that are super normal.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:20.320]   And we would never say that those abide in normal times, and we've created a framework for him to be
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.200]   able to do those things in non-normal times and then revert to normal. I think this is one of those
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.840]   cases just because I don't think the economic consequences and the social consequences,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.880]   if we let this thing continue to compound and continue to mutate, it doesn't make any
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.200]   fucking sense. We're not learning anything. We could have used the War Mandate Act
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.520]   across two presidencies to demand some companies make a dollar test.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   We have 75, 80 tests approved in Germany. They're down to two or three dollars.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:57.680]   Why has the FDA not gotten us to that level that Germany's at? And why haven't we done the
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.400]   War Mandate Act?
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:04.720]   I mean, we have a constructed capitalist model of let the free market tell the government what
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.360]   is the right thing to do. And so then they invite Abbott, and they invite the guys in,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.920]   and they're like, the White House, and they have a consortium meeting, and everyone's a little bit
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.120]   chuckling about this. Like, "Oh, this is awesome. It's another $2 billion payday," which is what
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.360]   they just got. I don't know if you saw.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:25.120]   I don't know if you saw the write up today. But the federal government is paying Walmart
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.840]   for the difference between the wholesale cost and the retail cost so that consumers can now go buy
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.000]   Abbott tests at the wholesale price at the store. $2 billion taxpayer money gone.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.440]   When we could have had a bunch of smart scientists get together at the White House with a bunch of
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.880]   engineers, take over a frigging factory, and on a piece of paper, print 8 billion fucking tests,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.440]   and then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.460]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.540]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:47.600]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:47.680]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:47.760]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:47.840]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.360]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.400]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:50.560]   And then chop them up and distribute them for free.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.920]   Instead, we have this problem where we're like, depending on the Korean supply, I kid you not,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.000]   of the test kits that are like plastic, that's where they make all the like pregnancy test kits
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.360]   and all this stuff. And these, this like the commercial model is like, tell us how you want
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.600]   to make these tests, tell us what the right model is. And of course, you end up with a $30 test when
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.840]   in Germany, you can go buy a 50 cent test at any liquor store. And so it's constructed,
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:15.920]   straight up corruption. And if you can't buy a 50 cent test at any liquor store, it's constructed.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.360]   And if you can't buy a 50 cent test at any liquor store, it's constructed.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.640]   And if you go back, like, you know, I don't know if you know this, but the production board's
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.200]   named after the-
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.160]   Straight into the microphone.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.560]   Named after the war production board, which was set up during World War Two.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.520]   It's pretty humble.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.080]   What's that?
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.280]   It's pretty humble.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   Yeah. Took the war out. You know, but it was, but the idea was like, how do you take a system level
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:44.720]   design approach to solving kind of big problems? And one of the issues that we had during World
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.760]   War Two was the supply chain.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:45.840]   Supply chain.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:45.920]   Supply chain.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.960]   problem on making tanks and planes and so they put together a bunch of smart people
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   deutsch knows this better than anyone because he was alive he was alive and he was you can look at
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:00.080]   the old photos he was there guys you have the hammer before he dies he may be in the factory
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.760]   floor old as and um and there was basically a coordinated effort it's his birthday today
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.600]   by the way sorry la kaim happy birthday happy birthday um but there was a coordinated effort
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.760]   by engineers at the top down to design a system for making these things cheap and fast and that's
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.720]   an approach that i think we lost right like we kind of gave way to this model of yeah laissez
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   faire like you come in you tell me what you think we should do okay that's a good idea let's take
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.560]   photos and we're out and that's it like we don't have a wartime mentality right now we haven't had
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.960]   a wartime mentality since covet hit everyone's continued to try and parade around and get
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.400]   reelected and you know earn votes we're not taking this but we're not acting we're you know like
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.520]   every everything
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   time kind of a business or a government or any organization goes through a phase it goes through
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.360]   a wartime phase or a peace time phase we should be acting like we're in a wartime phase and we're not
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.920]   can i ask you a question if you may three or four of us basically pulling it up some money
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.240]   could you go and print eight billion of these tests in the u.s you cannot get them
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.840]   approved without the fda i'm not asking for approval i'm saying could you do it 100
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.480]   and how long you could buy some old freaking paper mill and in three months i mean you know this
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.440]   actually people in this room who could do this in um now isn't there a framework within fd
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:19.040]   a that basically allows you to effectively experiment on yourself there's a compassion
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.680]   there's a it's for drugs it's for therapeutics not for diagnostics so you're saying that if i
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.360]   want you can't build my own test and use it if you want to build it if you want to build a diagnostic
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.440]   test that tells someone whether or not they have a an illness you have to get fda approval in the
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:38.720]   united states so that's also published the foreign statement is regulatory capture like is one of the
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.280]   biggest issues we have and in related uh news
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.720]   by the way another insane statistic just sorry to interrupt i saw this today
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.600]   i forgot someone we know tweeted this the who wants to guess the ratio of administrators to
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.840]   doctors in the u.s healthcare system 300 to one yeah i saw it 300 to one yeah 900 to one today
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:04.080]   oh my god and that is up from five to one in 1970. by the way can i just build on what you said 900
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.000]   to one your initial tweet said 300 to one and it ended in 2010 right before obamacare passed
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.200]   so from 300 to 900
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.400]   yeah i think 900 was all obamacare yeah regulatory capture sax is shaking his head which by the way
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.080]   uh nothing against obamacare because i think like coming as a canadian i actually believe in
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.120]   subsidized healthcare and i think the the principle of obamacare was great but there was one fatal flaw
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.200]   which is it basically said okay you know what you're capped at the following margin
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.520]   and the minute that people said wait a minute i can only have a 20 gross margin what do you do
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.160]   you just jack up prices to basically jack up revenue because if you can only take 20
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.120]   you're going to take 20 of a bigger number than a smaller number
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.760]   and so it completely burned the incentives for any healthcare company in the united states
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.800]   to do anything other than just basically walk prices up and it's funny because if you look at
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.160]   the stock prices of these companies you you would have made more money being long united
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   healthcare than you would have been uh owning facebook google any of these other tech companies
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:07.040]   in the last decade crazy stat uh speaking of regulatory capture tesla uh got left out of this
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.960]   new tax credit or proposed tax credit insane for electric cars i don't know if you're going to talk
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.680]   about that but i think tesla is a very good example of that i don't know if you saw that but tesla wasn't
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   invited a couple of months ago to biden's ev summit elon responded like i wonder why i wasn't invited
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.720]   it turns out it's because they're not a union shop their employees make much more money than union
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.960]   employees make uh and but now as a punishment but hold on as a punishment the twelve thousand dollar
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.880]   credit that they're giving to or they're proposing to give to all ev manufacturers is only if you have
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.800]   union employees it's forty five hundred less to tesla and that's why they're not getting more money
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:48.720]   so literally two massive regulatory captures and corruption go or maybe sax no i mean i don't have
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.800]   much more to add to that i mean you hit the nail on the head i mean this is to serve the unions
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.480]   it's not to serve uh clean energy or the ev industry i mean a little bit for you but it's
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:08.240]   mostly for the unions the um on the one hand what we do is we say that climate change is this
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.640]   existential issue but then when the rubber
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.400]   meets the road if you look inside the infrastructure plan today we unveiled
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.440]   basically how we're going to do all the tax credits and again it's just an enormous amount
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:26.560]   of just sloppy regulatory capture we're doubling and tripling credits in certain places we're
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.720]   disallowing credits in other places when you follow the dollars what happens is you can map
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:36.800]   it to companies those companies tend to be mostly public large balance sheets large lobbying efforts
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.480]   and it's not necessarily the most important companies that matter so if you know
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.400]   if i said to you what are the most important companies in climate change you'd probably say
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.720]   well maybe it's direct air capture maybe it's nuclear maybe it's some other thing that basically
