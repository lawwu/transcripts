[00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.240]   The annual State of AI report is one of the most cited documents in the field of artificial
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.360]   intelligence endorsed by the likes of Andrej Karpathy. Led by Nathan Benet this year,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.440]   the original co-author Ian Hogarth is now one of the key players at the Bletchley Global AI
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.600]   Summit in November. Yes, I read all 163 pages of this year's edition and thought that giving
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.560]   you just the highlights interspersed with developments from just the last few days
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.720]   like Eureka would be a good way of keeping you guys up to speed. But let's start out with a
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.120]   modality that the report didn't cover. Notice on page 7 we have text, image, video, music, robot
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   states and we'll cover all of those but what we don't have is thoughts. And why am I bringing that
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.480]   up you might ask? Well because a few days ago we had this from Meta: "Towards a real-time decoding
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.080]   of images from brain activity". Now I have showcased thought to image and thought to text before on the
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.160]   channel but never real-time thought to image. It's not perfect but progress is astonishing and
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.680]   I think it points to the explosion of modalities that we are seeing at the moment in AI. Now if
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.520]   you're willing to sacrifice a real-time flow of images from the brain this is the state of the
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.760]   art using fMRI. Much more accurate but not real-time. Now many of you might wonder if it works if
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.640]   someone imagines an image and apparently it doesn't work nearly as well. And also at the moment it tends not to be a real-time decoding.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.680]   Also at the moment it tends not to work if the participants are distracted by other things.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.920]   As the paper says: "In other words the subject's consent is not only a legal but also a technical
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.480]   requirement for brain decoding". Back to the report and many pages are dedicated to covering GPT-4
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.760]   but to be honest anyone who's followed this channel for any length of time will know a fair bit more
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.600]   than what is covered in these few slides. So I'm going to skip to page 14 where I have a slight
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.880]   difference with one of the conclusions. They cite a paper which describes the false promise of
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   imitating proprietary LLMs, large language models. Basically saying that you can imitate the style
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.560]   but not the content of a smarter model. But I wish that they had cited Orca which despite being more
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.800]   than 10 times smaller than the original ChachiPT reaches according to the technical paper parity
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.200]   with ChachiPT on various benchmarks showing only a four-point gap in professional and academic
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   examinations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE and GMAT. That's maybe why the information reported on
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.560]   Microsoft trying to substitute for GPT-4 with Orca. Claiming to mimic the quality of OpenAI
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.440]   software at a fraction of the cost. On page 38 of the report they describe
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.840]   open-ended learning with large language models. Describing how they can explore
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.080]   and gain skills in a game like Minecraft. And they say that the best example of this kind of
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.680]   self-improvement and iterative prompting is Voyager. Which is again GPT-4 getting better
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   and better at Minecraft. But just after the report came out we got Eureka. And yes it deserves its
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.600]   own video but as Jim Phan, one of the key authors said, it's like Voyager in the space of physics
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.880]   simulations. And essentially what they did was feed the source code of the environment to
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.960]   GPT-4. And then they asked it to write the code for the reward function. And then using the sheer
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.360]   power of parallelization inside Nvidia's Isaac Jim. They could then test out those reward functions.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400]   See which ones in simulation work the best. Thanks to GPU acceleration you could speed
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.440]   up reality a thousand x. Each time the best grading systems would be used, refined upon
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.920]   and then tested again. All in simulation. Ultimately Eureka rewards outperformed expert human written
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.520]   reward functions on 83% of the tasks performed. The average margin was 52% and Eureka was able to
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.040]   learn even pin spinning tricks. Which are notoriously difficult even for CGI artists.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.400]   This marrying up of large language models and iterative feedback from the environment is
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.880]   probably the future of AI. As Shetal Shah from Microsoft said, the proverbial positive feedback
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.960]   loop of self-improvement might be just around the corner. That allows us to go beyond human-made
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.120]   training data and capabilities. And to those wondering, yes they are planning to connect it to
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.400]   a real robotic hand soon. I was lucky enough to get early access to the report and one of the most
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.040]   convincing and amusing demonstrations was Eureka learning how to run efficiently. Back to the
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   report though and if Eureka was all about simulated embodiment. Getting better with
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   language feedback. How about language tasks being improved with robotics data? As this page
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.000]   demonstrates the positive transfer seems to go both ways. Gaining vision data and embodiment or
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.080]   robotics data seems to make a model like Palm-E better at pure language tasks. And while the
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.960]   report went on to mention RT2, watchers of my channel will know about RT2X. That showed how
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.800]   data from a multiplicity of different robotic setups could complement each other and improve
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.840]   the base model. The basic message across the board is the same. More data from more modalities in the
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.440]   same modality. And so when we get Eureka improving via feedback from GPT-4, it reminds me of a
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.280]   previous video where I talked about DALI-3 improving from feedback from GPT-4 vision.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   The same themes are reoccurring. Improvements in one modality ricocheting across two others.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.480]   And remember the original Palm language model and GPT-4 weren't even designed for this. I
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.280]   am genuinely curious about the kind of recursive improvement that might occur with
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.320]   a model designed to be multimodal from the start like Gemini. Speaking of robotics though,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.840]   the report did mention something I missed on the channel. That's the first time win for a robot in
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.760]   a competitive sport, which was first person view drone racing. Here is a glimpse of why the Swift
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.960]   system beat all the human champions. "The trajectories flown by the humans and Swift,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.160]   we noticed that the autonomous system is more consistent across laps and is able to take tighter
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.720]   turns." "The trajectory is flown by the humans and swift, we noticed that the autonomous system is more consistent across laps and is able to take tighter turns."
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.760]   "This gives it a decisive advantage in a race."
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.600]   "Swift won multiple races against each of the human champions and achieved the fastest recorded race time."
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:33.200]   "This marks the first time that an autonomous mobile robot has achieved
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.960]   world champion level performance in a real world competitive sport."
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.560]   What might come next? Well, these have received approval in China for fully autonomous flights,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.120]   and the new model is expected to be launched in the next few months.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.200]   Let me know in the comments if you would fly in one of these e-hang drones. At the moment I'm
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.240]   undecided, probably not right now, I'd have to see in action for a bit longer.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.480]   On page 58 the authors describe another year of progress in music generation. But rather than
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.400]   just describe this progress, I want you to hear it. I'm not sponsored by them, but I've been honestly
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   very impressed by Suno AI. Check out a snippet of the following rap, all generated by Suno.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:22.240]   "A.I. explain, breaking through the mold, diving deep discovering secrets untold.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:32.080]   Smarter than human, it's a whole new game. Unleashing power, a technological flame."
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.560]   If you like that one, I'm going to end the video with another sample. Very quickly though, the way
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.440]   to test it out is to join their discord, click on one of the chirp beaters, and then just type
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.240]   forward slash chirpbeaters.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.080]   Then you have to press enter again, for some reason, and up this will come.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.920]   At the top you can put things like rap or classical, whatever you want. And then you
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.560]   can either enter 4-8 lines of your own lyrics or have ChatGPT do it for you.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.880]   Honestly don't make more than around 8 lines because it degrades performance quite a lot.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.720]   Page 63 briefly describes the progress in medical performance of language models.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.080]   And I do honestly think that was worth highlighting. I just wonder if MedPalm 2, when it got 85%
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.520]   used a smart GPT like framework. Because if it didn't, things like self consistency,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.880]   chain of thought prompting, and reflection could boost the score even higher than 85%.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   In other words, it is not out of the question that we could soon have in our pockets
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.800]   a model capable of outperforming all but the very best doctors at medical question answering.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.280]   Speaking of medicine, apparently it's the fastest growing field in terms of mentions
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.920]   of AI within papers. And just look at the breadth of fields now applying
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.320]   AI to achieve research breakthroughs and the increase in volume.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.800]   And notice at the bottom how much mathematics is benefiting from this progress.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.400]   And I bet many of you don't know about the automated prover and proof assistant GPT-F.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.800]   One of the co-authors of that in 2020 was Ilya Sutskova of OpenAI.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.040]   It was about proving mathematical theorems using a GPT model.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.760]   And again something many might not know is that that was superseded in 2022 by Meta. Their neural
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.360]   theorem prover solved 10 international math olympiad problems. That's 5 times more than
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.040]   any previous system. Their method was called "hypertree proof search" and is way too complicated
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.920]   for me to cover in this video. And that's not even touching Alpha Tensor from Google DeepMind
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.160]   which improved upon decades old methods for matrix multiplication. That has direct ramifications for
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.600]   the usage of GPUs in modern day AI. Very quickly what they did to automate algorithmic discovery was
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.440]   to convert the finding of efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication into a single player game.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.160]   And I love this bit. They say this game is incredibly challenging. The number of possible
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.720]   algorithms to consider is much greater than the number of atoms in the universe. And compared to
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.840]   the game of Go, which remained a challenge for AI for decades, the number of possible moves at
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.200]   each step of our game is 30 orders of magnitude larger. And it's the synergies that I'm interested
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.440]   in. The breakthroughs in one field that will then be applied to another. The
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.200]   art results in one modality that push forward another modality. And the number of people trying
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.280]   to do this is multiplying as well. Honestly, I hadn't even heard of Imbue. Apparently they have
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.160]   10,000 H100s which are the most cutting edge GPUs. I don't know how I missed an AI company with 5
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.480]   figure numbers of H100 GPUs but here's the CEO describing their approach. At Imbue we're training
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.280]   large foundation models optimized for reasoning. On top of those models we build agents that we use
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.720]   to accelerate our own research. And these do more than just output something. They also iterate and
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.880]   reflect and figure out what's the next step to do and then take that next step. We're starting with
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.600]   agents that code because it requires complex reasoning to be able to code well and because
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.480]   that's the work we do every day. They seem to be flying completely under the radar with only about
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.840]   300 subscribers on their channel. So to be honest, if we see the kind of manual dexterity
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.120]   that Eureka promises and a breakthrough in reasoning like Imbue and frankly every
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.160]   other company is working on. And if AI can start to crack international math olympiad problems and
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.320]   compose rap battles, it does start to become a genuine question of what can't they do. I'm not
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.920]   saying that's true now, far from it, but in the not too distant future that may well be a very
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.400]   valid question. In the industry section on page 82 the authors describe the chip export bans that
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.960]   apply to H100s. Basically companies like Nvidia and Intel can't sell their cutting edge chips to China
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.160]   and select other countries. And those companies got around it by creating models like the A100
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.720]   which were just outside of the export restriction range. Well the report is already somewhat out of
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.880]   date in that respect. Just four days ago we hear that those chips are now also under export
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.200]   restrictions. Another development that's occurred since the publication of the report concerns
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.040]   copyright. The report detailed how Microsoft has moved to reassure the users of its tools that the
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   corporation will assume any use of the chip.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.560]   So the report is that the company is now under the jurisdiction of the company that is responsible
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.360]   for the copyright claim. And of course every day we seem to be reading reports of one company or
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.800]   another getting sued as it relates to AI data. But just a few days ago we had this, Google giving
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.560]   the same kind of indemnification. Basically if the use of one of its Gen AI products triggers
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.600]   any copyright claims, it, Google, will assume legal responsibility, it says.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.640]   My only prediction is that this battle over data and copyright is not going anywhere.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.400]   So the report is that the company is now under the jurisdiction of the corporation that is
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.840]   responsible for the use of the chip. And that's why it's so important that the company
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.400]   is not under the jurisdiction of the corporation that it's not going anywhere.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.280]   So the report is that the company is now under the jurisdiction of the corporation that it's
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.160]   not going anywhere. So the report is that the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.600]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the report is that the company is now under the
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.360]   jurisdiction of the corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.160]   jurisdiction of the corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.480]   jurisdiction of the corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   of the corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   corporation that it's not going anywhere. So the company is now under the jurisdiction of the
