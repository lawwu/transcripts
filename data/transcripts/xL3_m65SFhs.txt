[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.740]   Pastor John, a listener named Alicia emailed to ask, "What role does the vast
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.340]   field of art play in the Church? In a nutshell, can you give a theology of art?"
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.820]   There are great books on art, and I haven't read most of them or written any
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.980]   of them, but I'll tell you what I think, and that's all I can do, and if it
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.740]   gives some help, I'm thankful. The word "art," I think, comes from a Latin word
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.780]   "art" that means skill or craft or craftsmanship. So here's the way I would
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.140]   define the word. Any effort to make something, and that could be an object or
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.020]   an action, like you make a dance or you can make an action in a play, or an
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.380]   object like a carving or a painting or a sculpture or a poem, so any action that
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:16.380]   makes something that takes a special skill so that the result is more than
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.300]   utilitarian or pragmatic but moves us more deeply with beauty or wonder or
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.980]   something touching our soul with a sense that life is more than food and drink.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.780]   So that's a long, complicated definition, but basically it's a craft, a skill
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.980]   that aims at an effect that is more than just keeping food on the table. And
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:55.580]   what makes it Christian, I think, so here's the theology part, is God is an
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.540]   artist. He made the heavens that are telling something about his glory. In
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.060]   other words, he didn't just make the heavens to protect us from solar rays.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.180]   They're not just utilitarian, they're beautiful. They say something
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.220]   about his glory. And Job is just great on this, as you read the last chapters of
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.300]   Job, God is pointing to his artistry all over the place and what it says to Job
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:33.380]   about his life from nature. And Jesus, you know, the lilies and the birds and the
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.620]   leaven, all of it is more than utilitarian. So my first way of getting a
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.380]   theology of art is that God is one. And then secondly, I would say the Bible
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.980]   writers are one. They're artists. They put things--maybe three-fourths of the
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.620]   Bible is crafted in some way linguistically so that it's poetic or
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.580]   striking or unusual, and it obviously evidences some craft that is intended
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.540]   not merely to communicate a raw fact but to produce a certain kind of effect in
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.700]   us spiritually, which is what artists want to do. So there are acrostics in the
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.620]   Bible and there are parallels in the Bible, there are metaphors in the Bible, and these
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.340]   writers clearly are giving artful attention to how they are shaping their
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.340]   words, and they're doing that under the inspiration of God. And maybe one
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.340]   more thing, Paul says, echoing Jesus, "Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink,
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.820]   do all to the glory of God." Well that must mean take thought in everything you
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.500]   do to try to craft it in such a way that it has an effect that opens the eyes to
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.100]   see beauty, namely glory, the glory of God. Which means there ought to be a way of
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.540]   eating pizza and drinking pop or doing the laundry and making your bed and
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.580]   making meals and writing reports and driving your car that are not merely,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.340]   "I've got to get someplace," or "I've got to get something done," but rather, "I'm supposed
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.980]   to do it so that it has an effect beyond the merely utilitarian." And Jesus said,
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.980]   "Let your light, let your light so shine that men may see your good deeds and give
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.260]   glory to your Father in heaven." So there, we're to take our bodies and our lives
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.580]   and cause them to have a kind of brightness so that when people look at
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.420]   them, they look at them and there is a kind of artful intentionality that
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.900]   gets people to see something more than a mere body. So God is the Maker,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.260]   right? And we have the mind of the Maker. We talked about this once before, and
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.540]   therefore it seems to me that Christians have the deepest and best
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:16.100]   foundations for serious art than anybody. Thank you, Pastor John. We did talk about
