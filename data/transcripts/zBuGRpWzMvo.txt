[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   Tax-loss harvesting, I have done it myself.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.840]   I think it's a neat tool.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.580]   The sad thing is that if you have no gains
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.160]   to use them as an offset
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.800]   and you are bound by these $3,000 a year,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.000]   some people will argue it's not really worth the hassle
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.920]   to do that.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.720]   For me personally, because I generate some capital gains,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.260]   so I do some options trading
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260]   and that generates both short-term
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.860]   and long-term capital gains.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.480]   It brings up a whole other issue.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.180]   So for example, a lot of people now
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.900]   want to do direct indexing, right?
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900]   So instead of buying the index fund,
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.060]   they still do the index.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.640]   They still do the S&P 500 index,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.860]   but they implement the S&P 500 index
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.360]   with the underlying constituents.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.700]   And then you can do a lot more tax-loss harvesting.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.740]   For some people with a lot of taxable gains
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.620]   that they want to offset, that is very useful.
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.620]   If you don't have a lot of taxable gains
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.180]   and the $3,000 is all you can really offset every year,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.260]   might be a whole lot of hot air over nothing,
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.900]   but definitely for a lot of people,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.960]   tax-loss harvesting can be super helpful.
