[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the third chapter.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And we read from verse two to verse seven, from the second to the seventh verse in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you, O Lord, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   as I wrote afore in few words, whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Now I have read all that for one simple reason, and that is that that is just one sentence.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   It's a great sentence, of course, with many subdivisions, but it is actually just one sentence.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And there is a sense, therefore, in which if we are to understand any of its individual parts correctly and truly,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   we must have some conception of the whole statement and of the entire thing which the apostle is here saying.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now those who were here last Sunday will remember that we began our consideration of this great chapter,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and we dealt with that first verse where he says, "For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He is about to tell them how he is praying for them, but in doing that he refers to himself as the prisoner of Jesus Christ for them.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And that, as we saw, leads to this long digression which starts at the beginning of the second verse and goes on until the end of the thirteenth verse.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Now we were at pains to point out, and I must repeat it in order that we may have our context and setting clear in our minds,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   that what the apostle has uppermost in his mind is just this.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He knew that these Ephesians were troubled about the fact that he was a prisoner.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It rather tended to stumble them in their faith, as it has often stumbled God's people throughout the centuries.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We all seem to have the notion that as long as we are Christians, and especially if we should happen to be as notable a Christian as this great apostle,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   that it should mean that we would never have any troubles, that we'd never be in difficulties at all.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We all seem to cling to this magical notion of the Christian life, and we seem to think that the New Testament promises
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   that the moment you become a Christian, the rest of your story can be summarized by the phrase, "And they all lived happily ever afterwards."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But of course that isn't the case, and the apostle, this unusual exception of men, was actually a prisoner as he was writing these words.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And he knew that they were in trouble over that, so he now is proceeding to put them right.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And he wants them really to see these things in such a way that not only, as he says in verse 13, they will not faint at it, but they will even glory in it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Well now, how can he do that? Well, the only way to do that is to show them how he himself looks at it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He wants to show them that he himself is really glorying in it.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And now he is going to open it out to them, and that's what he begins to do in verse 2 at the very beginning of the digression.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   "I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you all,"
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   or you might translate it, "Assuming that you do know, taking it for granted that you are aware of the fact that I am in this special position with respect to you."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Now, some people are in trouble over this expression, "If ye have heard," as if the apostle were doubtful about that.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   No, it's not an expression of doubt. It's just a way of saying, as I say, "Assuming that."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Of course, you know, "Taking it for granted."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And yet, you know, though the apostle does assume that they know it, he nevertheless proceeds to tell them all about it.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And there again, I think, is one of those lessons which we should never fail to learn as we read the Scriptures.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   "You do know all about this," says the apostle, "but I'm going to remind you of it again."
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Now, the very essence of good teaching is repetition.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Because we all think we know things, but if we're examined about them, we discover we don't know them.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Not only that, though we may know things theoretically, some way or another, when we're in trouble and in difficulty,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   we fail to apply the knowledge.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And therefore, it becomes necessary that we should be reminded again of this.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And that is what the apostle does. They know all about this.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   He himself had told them. Others had told them.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yet, because they're in trouble about his imprisonment, he says, "I must tell you all about it again."
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Now, I think that he does this quite deliberately.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   He does it for that reason that I've just been giving, that it is so important that they should understand this.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It's because they haven't really understood it, that they're misunderstanding his tribulations.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But not only that, you can't read this digression without getting the sense that the apostle is very glad indeed to go over the great story once more.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It's such a magnificent story. It's such a glorious story.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It's such a wonderful thing.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So that he doesn't apologize for repeating it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Why, there are some things that can never be said too often.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   They're so magnificent in and of themselves.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Very well, though.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He's telling them that it is only as they grasp this tremendous thing that God has done for them through him, the apostle,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   that they not only will not be stumbled at his imprisonment,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   but will indeed end by praising God as they see the perfection of his inscrutable ways.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And the same, of course, still applies to us.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   There can be no doubt at all about this,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   that there is nothing which is so comforting, so reassuring to faith,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   nothing which is quite so exhilarating in the Christian life,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   as just to stand back and to contemplate and to understand something of God's great plan and scheme and purpose of redemption.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And that is the thing which the apostle here unfolds to these Ephesians,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and through them unfolds it to us.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Here, you see, he's just giving them a very hurried picture of how it was the gospel ever came to them.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   They who formerly had been pagans, living that godless life,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   worshipping a multiplicity of gods, polytheists as they all were,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   especially in Ephesus, worshipping the great goddess Diana, the goddess of the Ephesians,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   making images and idols.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   There they were, and of course living on a very low moral level,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   such as you always get in paganism and with polytheism.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   There they had been, but now they're saints in the church of God.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   They're worshipping together with the converted Jews.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The thing is quite astounding, it's almost incredible.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And the great question is, how has it ever come to pass?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Well, now then, the apostle proceeds to tell them,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and especially in this long sentence, beginning here at verse 2 and going on to the end of verse 7.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Very well, then, let's look at this together and realize as we do so
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   that this is not merely a matter of academic interest.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It isn't merely that we're going to spend a little time this morning
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   in looking at the history of the apostle Paul.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Someone may say, "Well, why do you detain us with that?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Don't you realize that the world is full of troubles and problems?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   What has all this got to do with us?"
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I think you will see that when we've analyzed what the apostle says,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   that he deals here with certain matters which are absolutely fundamental to the whole Christian position.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Not only that, he has certain things to say here,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   which seem to me to be most important with regard to all this talk today about ecumenicity
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   and great world church and how we all ought to be together,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   even including Roman Catholicism to fight communism and so on.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   All this current talk, it seems to me that here he introduces us to certain cardinal principles,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   which if we do not understand them truly as we ought,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   will probably lead us into grievous error.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   In other words, I'm suggesting that as he tells us here his own personal history,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   he is indicating the New Testament teaching with regard to the church and certain offices in the church
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and the whole nature of Christian truth.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Very well, then what does he say?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Well, the first thing he tells them is this.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   He says, "You know, you are what you are.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You are members of the Christian church.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And I am in prison at the moment simply because I am an apostle.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Then he goes on to say later on that this self-same mystery
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   has been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   "Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Now then, here we are beginning to look at this extraordinary provision that God has made.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And how pathetic it is to realize how infrequently we do stop and meditate upon all this.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   We are told so often in the scriptures that God has planned and purposed redemption
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But how often do we work that out in detail?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Have we seen this great master plan of God?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   How every part and portion had been planned and foreordained,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   and how when the fullness of the times had come, God began to put it into practice.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   He had got this great purpose of uniting Gentile and Jew,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and of sending this message of salvation throughout the whole world.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Now how was this to be done?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Well, as the apostle will tell us in chapter 4, he has got this great scheme of the church.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   but then he has given gifts unto men.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And there are these divisions of offices.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors, some teachers,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And what a perfect plan it is.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Now all this has been ordained of God.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And the apostle says, "I was called by God to be an apostle."
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   But you notice the beautiful language in which he puts it.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   "A dispensation of the grace of God has been given to me, to you all."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   God, he says, has entrusted to me a stewardship of this marvelous grace of his.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   God has appointed me to be one of the custodians and the guardians of this precious favor,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   which he is showing to mankind in the Son of his love, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Now, you can see at a glance why it was the apostle doesn't apologize for repeating this sort of thing.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   He never got over this. He never got over the marvel and the wonder of it.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   That he who had been a blasphemer and a persecutor, a man who hated Christ and his cause,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and who thought he was doing God's service by persecuting the Christian church,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   that he had actually been given this dignity, this honor, this privilege,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   of being called by God himself to be an apostle of this message, a dispenser of this truth,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   one who was called to propagate this astounding good news that has come into the world
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   In other words, his claim is, as he claims everywhere,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   that he is in the fullest sense of the term an apostle.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   He is as much an apostle as Peter and James and John and all the other apostles.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   He who had been so opposed to it, he's in it. "This grace has been given unto me," he says.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Well, now, we must just look for a moment at what he includes in this definition and in this designation.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   To be an apostle means that one had been very definitely and specifically called
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   by God himself, by the Lord Jesus Christ in particular.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   If you read these various epistles of this apostle in the New Testament and watch his introductions,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   you will find that he invariably almost refers to himself as one who is called to be an apostle,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   which is better put like this, a called apostle.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Now, a man could not have been an apostle unless he had been called in this unique and special manner.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   An apostle, in other words, is never someone who is appointed by the Church.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   No man can appoint an apostle. No man can create an apostle.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   An essential part of the definition of the calling of an apostle is that in a very unique and special and direct way,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   he has been called of God.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Now, the apostle puts it here like this, "A grace has been given to me. A gift has been given to me.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   An honor has been conferred upon me."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   He, I say, is very much concerned to emphasize this.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Let me give you another instance of it where he writes to the Galatians.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Look at him opening his letter to the Galatians.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   "Paul, an apostle."
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Then in brackets, "Not of men, neither by men, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead."
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You notice how he puts it and how important the negative is.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   "Not of men, neither by men."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   You can't be an apostle of men or by men.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Now, he does that, you see, for this good reason, that there were going around the churches in those early days false apostles.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Men who went and said, "I am an apostle."
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And they said, "Don't believe the preaching of that apostle, Paul. He's not an apostle at all.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   He's just a man who set himself up."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   They said, "We are the apostles."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And they told these people that they must be circumcised, they must submit to certain rights,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   and that this free gospel of salvation wasn't true.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And what the apostle is always asserting is this, that they are false apostles.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   They are the Antichrist, as the apostle John calls them.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   They were never called by God.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   They've been appointed either by men, themselves or some other men.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They are of men and by men, and not by Jesus Christ and of God.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   But he says that he is a true apostle.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   This grace, he says, has been given unto me.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And what a term it is.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   The thing itself is a grace.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   It's a dispensation of a grace.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   But he also includes this.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   When God called a man to be an apostle, by his grace he equipped him to be an apostle.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   He gave him certain gifts.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And there were certain signs and marks of an apostle always.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   An apostle was a man who was always given the grace and the power to work miracles and signs and wonders.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   A man was not an apostle unless he was able to do this.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   You'll find many references to that again right through the New Testament scriptures.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   One of the seals, the marks, the signs of an apostle was that he had this supernatural, miraculous power.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And so, when you read the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you will read a phrase like this,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   "Special miracles were worked by the apostle Paul."
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Special miracles.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   They were so profuse that people stood and marveled and wondered at it.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And indeed that happened in this very city of Ephesus when he was there and led to an uproar,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   as you will read in chapter 19 of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Very well then, but above all that and still more important for our immediate purpose was this.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   An apostle was a man to whom God in a very special way gave the message of salvation.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   "A dispensation," he says, "of the grace of God has been given to me."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   The apostles are the stewards, the guardians, the custodians of this mystery of the faith.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Now again, it would be a very simple matter to give you large numbers of quotations
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   in which the apostle says the same thing. Let me give you just one.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Now to the first epistle to the Corinthians, in the fourth chapter, in the first verse, we read this,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God."
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Now you see, all this is of tremendous importance for us.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   We've been already told by this apostle in the previous chapter
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   that the church of God is established upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Well, we must know what that means. Well, here he's helping us to understand it.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   God takes these men, these certain men, and he makes them stewards.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   He makes them the custodians, the administrators of his marvelous redeeming grace.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Now here you see the opening of the plan of redemption.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   God the Father thought of it, he planned it, in the fullness of the times,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   he sent his only begotten Son into the world to do the work that was absolutely necessary.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   If the Son hadn't come and taught and died and borne the sins of men and their punishment
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and risen again and gone back into heaven, this could never have been done.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   The grace of God comes through the Lord Jesus Christ. All right.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Then he sends the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   In order that this grace that has been prepared may now be administered,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   that it may be dispensed to us.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   There is no point in providing it unless the channel has been prepared
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   by which it can come to us individually and we can receive it and enjoy it.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, how did he do it? Well, the Holy Spirit does it in this way.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   He gives this enabling and this understanding and this power and ability
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   to these men whom God has called and appointed to be the custodians and the guardians and the stewards.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Now go back to the beginning of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   and there you will see it all quite perfectly.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Our blessed Lord has risen again from the dead.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   He has manifested himself for forty days to his disciples.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   They know the facts about his life and death and resurrection,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   but still they are not in a condition to go and preach.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   They cannot do that until they have received this fullness, this baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Then they can, then they did.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And filled with the Spirit of God they went and they preached this message.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   That is what he means by saying that a dispensation, a stewardship
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   of this amazing mystery of God's grace has been given even unto me.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And he filled me with his Spirit. He enabled me to understand and he has sent me out to preach.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   He has given me power to preach and to attest it by the miracles.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And so I came to you and I preached to you and you believed and you are in the church
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and I am in prison because I did that.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Now that is what he is telling me.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   What a tremendous thing this is.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   That these Ephesians, most of whom were probably but ordinary common slaves,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   had come into this eternal plan and scheme of God.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Look at the trouble to which God has gone in order that you and I might be redeemed
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and might be rescued and might become saints and might eventually spend our eternity
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   in his glorious presence.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Now then, says Paul to the Ephesians, don't you faint because of my tribulations?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Don't think so much of my chains in prison.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Think of this amazing thing that God has done.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   A dispensation of the grace of God has been given to me, to you, for you.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   He did that to me on the road to Damascus.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   There I was given it. He said, I have called you to be a minister and a witness.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Do you remember how we saw it there in the reading in the 26th chapter of the book of the Acts?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Then the dispensation was given to him and he was sent to preach to the Jews and to the Gentiles.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Think of that, says the apostle.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   See this great purpose of God.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Don't look at me and waste your sympathy on me.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   I am glorying in the fact that I am suffering for his name's sake.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I want you to glory in it. Look at it like that.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But then that takes us on to this second statement which he makes.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Something, he says, has been committed to him.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   He's been made a steward.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   It's an obvious picture, isn't it?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   A great man with his castle and his great possessions.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   He can't do everything himself.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   What does he do? Well, he has to appoint stewards.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   He puts one man in charge of this and another man in charge of that.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   They are responsible. They look after it.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   They have to care for it and protect it and defend it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Stewards. Paul says, something has been committed to me and entrusted to me.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I am a steward of what?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Well, you notice what he calls it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   He calls it a mystery.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Now that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And he repeats it.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I wrote afore in few words, whereby when he read he may understand my knowledge,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   in the mystery of Christ.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Now, you can't read these New Testament epistles
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   without constantly meeting this word "mystery."
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And therefore it is absolutely essential that we should understand what he means by it.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   He is an administrator of the mystery.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   What is this mystery?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Now, it's very important we should understand this word today in particular for this good reason.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   That there are those who think that the meaning of this term "mystery" is
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   that the Christian message, the Christian faith, is something vague and indefinite and nebulous.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Something which rarely cannot be defined at all.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And that really this is nothing but some kind of mysticism.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   There are those, I say, who hold that view.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You are familiar with the teaching.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And here I am able to show you the practical relevance of this section to our immediate position.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Now, the whole tendency at the present time is to discount definition.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And to discount doctrine and dogma.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And all theological formulation.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   You see, this is the way in which it's put to us.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   They say these are the things that divide Christians.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And as the one thing that matters is that we should all be united,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   well, obviously we mustn't consider these things at all.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Indeed, they go further and they say this.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   That Christianity by its very nature is something that eludes definition.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Ah, they say, but you mustn't try and define these things.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   It's a wonderful mystical experience.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   It is a mystery.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And you can't say what it is, but you can be initiated into it, as it were.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You can't put it on paper, but you can feel it and experience it.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   But the moment you try to say what it is and to define it and say it is this and isn't that,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   well, then of course you're destroying it. It's no longer a mystery.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   It's now becoming plain and clear.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So they interpret the word mystery as meaning mysticism,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   or almost mistiness, a vagueness, indefiniteness,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   something, I say, that cannot be reduced to propositions.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   But surely the apostle himself here and everywhere else denies such a contention completely.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   What the apostle says is this, that the mystery has been revealed,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   that he is a preacher because the mystery has been revealed to him.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It isn't something vague and indefinite.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   What it is has been made plain and clear to him.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Well, then what is the mystery?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Well, a mystery in the New Testament sense is a technical term,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and it means this.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It is a truth which, because of its character,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   can never be attained unto or arrived at by the unaided human intellect or ability.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   That is what the New Testament means by a mystery.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   The thing itself is clear.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   But because man is what he is,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   he cannot by his own unaided intellect arrive at it or understand it.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Now, then, let me take you again to the classical statement of that
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   in the first epistle to the Corinthians in the second chapter,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   where the apostle has put it perfectly once and forever.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Listen to this.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "Howbeit," he says, "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to naught.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   which none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   But as it is written, 'Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   neither have entered into the heart of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.'
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Now, there it is.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   The wisdom that we speak, says Paul, is not the wisdom of this world.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   It is the hidden wisdom, the hidden mystery of God.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Now, the natural man, even though he be a prince, he doesn't understand it.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   He can't arrive at it. His intellect is not adequate.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   But God hath revealed them unto us by the Spirit.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   So that the mystery, you see, is something.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Not vague and indefinite and nebulous. No, it's very definite.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   But man can never arrive at it. He must receive it from God.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And when he receives it, he understands it and he can expound it.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And so, you see, what the apostle is saying here is this.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   That what God committed to him as a custodian, as a steward, as a trustee,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   was an insight into a knowledge of this amazing mystery.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   So that he is able now to transmit it and to impart it unto others.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And that was his business as an apostle.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Very well, there is one of the terms, the mystery.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And then he says that this was something that was revealed unto him.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And oh, again, how constantly does he impress this upon us.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And so, says Paul, I haven't arrived at this knowledge any more than anybody else by my own understanding.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Do you remember how he put it to King Agrippa on that famous occasion?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   I verily thought with myself that I should do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   That's his thinking.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And he'd have gone on till his death doing that.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Denouncing it, hating it, persecuting it.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   When he thought with himself, his own human understanding.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And what happened? Well, he said, I was on the road to Damascus.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I was going down to exterminate the Christians of Damascus.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Breathing out threatenings and slaughter, when suddenly about noonday,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I saw a light in the heavens above the brightest shining of the sun, and a face, and I heard a voice.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And what happened? Well, it was the Lord of Glory, the Lord Jesus Christ, appearing to him.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And he said to him, I have appeared unto thee, Paul, in order to tell you certain things.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   He revealed the mystery to me concerning himself and his great purpose.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And he gave me this dispensation. He made me an apostle.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   He said, I'm going to send thee.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Oh, we can never overemphasize this.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   I take you back again to the epistle to the Galatians, where the apostle,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   having said it in that first verse, repeats it in verses 11 and 12.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Listen to this.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   for I neither received it of men, neither was I taught it,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Look here, says the apostle, in effect, to these Ephesians,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   don't let anybody or anything upset your faith.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   What I have preached to you, I received not from men.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I wasn't taught it even by the other apostles.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I was taught it by the Lord Jesus Christ himself when he appeared to me on the road to Damascus.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   I've had it by revelation. He appeared to me there.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   He appeared to me again when I was in the temple one day.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   He appeared to me when I was in Corinth. I've had it by revelation.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It isn't what I think. It isn't the message that I'm repeating parrot fashion.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It isn't something that I've got in a book. He's given it me direct.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   My authority is none other than the authority of the Lord of glory himself.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Therefore, he says, hold on to these things.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   This is what makes me an apostle,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   that I have received it all by this direct revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And you notice that he says the same thing about all the holy apostles and prophets.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   You see, which brings us to this, which I'm anxious to emphasize before I close.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   The church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets in this way,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   that it is to the apostles and prophets that God has revealed the mystery.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The greatest men of the world couldn't understand it.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   They looked at Jesus of Nazareth. They said, he's just a man. He's a carpenter.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   They didn't see he was the son of God.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   That has to be revealed, the mystery of Christ.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   They couldn't see it. It wasn't revealed unto them.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Christ himself had said one day, you remember,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Revelation.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Now God has revealed this truth to the apostles and prophets once and forever.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   What were the prophets? Well, they were not apostles.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   The apostles were these select few, these twelve men,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   but there were these others, these prophets.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   What are they? Well, they are men who are given special understanding and enlightenment
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   of the truth that has been revealed and can teach it to others.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   You'll find the perfect definition of that in 1 Corinthians 14 3.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And now you see, this is where you and I come in.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   What you and I have in the New Testament
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   is the teaching of the apostles and prophets.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   We were considering a few Sunday mornings ago
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   the claim that the New Testament makes for itself,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   and we said this is the claim.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   The early church led of the Holy Spirit would not admit any book into the New Testament canon
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   unless it could either be proved that it had been written by an apostle
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   or else under the influence of an apostle.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Nothing else is canonical unless it comes with apostolic authority.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Now then, here it comes to us, the apostles and prophets.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   We have the message, the revelation of the mystery, here in this Word of God.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Very well, as we close, let us learn certain vital lessons for ourselves.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   The first is obviously this,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   the glorious character of what God has done for us in the gospel of redemption.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   I wonder whether we have seen something of its glory this morning,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   that the almighty eternal God should have taken such trouble,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   that those slaves in Ephesus, those pagans,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   should come to know this truth and become the children of God.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   What a plan! What a perfect plan!
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   What an organization!
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   There it is. It is all of grace, you see, it is all of God.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It wasn't Saul of Tarsus who decided to become a Christian and to go and preach in Ephesus.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Not at all. A dispensation of this marvelous grace, he said, has been given to me.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   He looked down upon me and he met me on the road to Damascus and he said,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   "Look here, I have taken hold of you because I want to make a steward of you."
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   The grace of God, the kindness, the mercy, the compassion of God.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   What an astounding thing!
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   My friends, I am afraid that you and I, modern Christians,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   don't like to contemplate the plan of salvation as our fathers did.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I mean the fathers of a century and two centuries, and especially three centuries ago,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   and the great Protestant fathers.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   They delighted in contemplating this great plan of redemption.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   As you and I do so, we shall be made to glory in it and to triumph in it,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   even as Paul wanted these Ephesians to.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   But then let us learn a lesson about the nature or the character of an apostle.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Have we realized that the office of an apostle is something absolutely unique?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   That an apostle was one who was called directly by the Lord,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   that he had to be a witness of the resurrection,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   that he was given a unique inspiration and authority,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   that he was given this power to attest his calling by miracles and signs and wonders?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Do we see the unique character of an apostle?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   That an apostle belongs to the foundation of the Church and the foundation only,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   so that I come to my next principle, which is this,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   that there can be no repetition of an apostle,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and that the talk of apostolic succession is simply to deny the scriptural teaching.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   There can be no successor to the apostles.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   The truth has been revealed.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   We don't need revelation.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   It was revealed to the apostles and prophets.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Then they, having transmitted it, having preached it, and having written it, we have it.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   So that as it is a part of the definition of an apostle,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   that he is a man who receives the revelation in a unique manner,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   there obviously can be no successor.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   In other words, our quarrel with Rome and its followers is not political, it's scriptural.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   They are denying the scripture.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   They are saying that a foundation can be perpetuated in the wall,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   and can be continued in the wall.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It's impossible.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   A foundation is once and forever on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Likewise, I trust that we have seen again something of the nature of Christian truth.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   It's not ordinary knowledge.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   It is not something that the unaided human intellect can understand and receive.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Without the enlightenment which the Holy Spirit alone can give,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   this truth remains as dark and as hidden to us
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   as it did to the princes of this world when the Lord of Glory was actually amongst men.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   We have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit that is of God,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   This is not ordinary truth.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Whatever our intellects, whatever our brilliance, it will never be enough.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   We must all become as little children.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   We need the inspiration and the anointing and the unction of the Holy Ghost.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And lastly, we are entirely dependent upon the scriptures.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   We can know no saving truth apart from what we find here.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   And obviously, in the light of all we've been saying, nothing can ever be added to this.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Again, you see where we separate from Rome.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Ah, she says we have received further revelation.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   But surely there can be no further revelation.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Revelation only comes to apostles and prophets.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And there are no apostles now and cannot be, by definition.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   So that we are entirely confined to this, we can add nothing to this.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   And thirdly, we must take nothing from this.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   We are in no position to pick and choose from this.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   We cannot say, "I believe this, I reject that.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   I rather like the teaching of Jesus, I don't believe in miracles.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I like the way in which he died, I don't believe he was born of a virgin."
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   The moment you begin to do that, you are denying revelation.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   You are saying that you are unaided human intellect is capable of judging this and sifting it
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   and finding what is true and what is false.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   You pick this, you reject that.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   That's to deny the whole principle of revelation, of apostolate, of this unique work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   So you see how important this digression is for us?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   We are absolutely shut in to the New Testament and its teaching.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I know nothing apart from that.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   I can't add to that, I can't subtract from it.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   I take it as it is, with the authority of the apostles.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Or else I just say, "Well, this is what I think and this is what I believe."
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Well, you are entitled to say that.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   But according to this authoritative word of the apostles, the authoritative word of God,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   if you do that, you are in darkness, you are unenlightened, and you remain outside the life of God
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   and without any experience of his grace and his blessing in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Call a called apostle, a dispensation of the grace of God has been entrusted to him and he's delivered it.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   You've got it, you're Christians, and I'm suffering for it.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Forget that.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Think of the glory and the marvel and the wonder of what God has provided for you
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   in his infinite grace and kindness.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Amen.
