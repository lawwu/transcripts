[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I would like to call your attention this evening to two portions of New Testament Scripture.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.960]   The first is in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, and reading verses 18, 19, and
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.360]   20, and then in Paul's first epistle to Timothy in chapter 3, verses 14, 15, and 16.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.880]   Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.100]   all perseverance and supplication for all saints, and for me, that utterance may be
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.120]   given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, for
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.340]   which I am an ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.800]   And again in 1 Timothy chapter 3, verses 14, 15, and 16, "These things write I unto thee,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.360]   hoping to come unto thee shortly.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.040]   But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:13.000]   house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.160]   And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.640]   the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.360]   Now I want to put together the statement of the apostle there in Ephesians 6, 19, where
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.520]   he asks for and covets the prayers of the members of the church at Ephesus, to the end
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.760]   that he might be given liberty and boldness, freedom and authority in making known the
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.440]   mystery of the gospel.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.440]   What is it?
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.080]   Well, here is a part of it.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.720]   Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.960]   He who was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.920]   the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   Now we are doing this as a part of our general consideration of the nature of the gospel
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.080]   and its message.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.240]   We have been doing this a number of Sunday evenings.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.280]   We are doing so because, as I have been trying to indicate, of all the tragedy of the world
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.560]   tonight, there is nothing that is more tragic than the misunderstanding of this gospel.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.960]   We are surrounded by tragedy.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.640]   We are surrounded by almost indescribable confusion in almost every realm.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.000]   Nothing is so characteristic of the whole of life today as this whole element of confusion.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.500]   We are all aware of this.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.600]   Things that used to be recognized as canons of judgment have all gone.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.400]   You see this in politics, you see it in art, you see it in music, everywhere.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.580]   What is music?
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.580]   What is melody?
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.240]   Who can tell today?
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.640]   You see it in the realm of morals, what everybody would have agreed about but a short while
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840]   ago as being sinful, almost beyond description.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.200]   Yesterday not only not regarded as sin, it is almost being justified.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.720]   You see all the canons seem to have gone.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   The landmarks have fallen down, have been removed and destroyed, and the whole world
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.840]   is in a state of confusion, and mankind is drifting.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.440]   It knows not where nor how.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.280]   Well now it is because of all that I say I am calling attention to this.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.080]   Because our message is that there is only one hope for the world, and it is this gospel.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.000]   I do not keep you tonight in proving that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   I think that the world proves it itself.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.160]   That is why as I have often said before, I am very glad that I am preaching in 1964
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   and not 1864.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.560]   You know in 1864 they really thought they were about to enter the millennium.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.080]   There had not been a war since, well there had been the Crimean War, but speaking generally
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.440]   and broadly as they used to put it then, there had not really been a great war since the
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.560]   Napoleonic Wars.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.600]   And everything seemed to be developing.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   Trade developing, expanding, the British Empire expanding, everything expanding, knowledge,
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.400]   and it was all so wonderful.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.440]   It must have been rather difficult to convince people then of the sinful state of the world.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.240]   There is no difficulty today.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.400]   The world is doing it for us.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.760]   The newspapers are, I contend always, the best introduction that I know to the gospel.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.920]   They provide the perfect introduction, all that they show us.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.760]   That is life without God.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.960]   Very well, that is where the gospel comes in as the only hope.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.320]   But if there is misunderstanding about this, well then there is no hope.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.040]   And that is why there is nothing more important or vital for us than that we should be absolutely
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.160]   clear in our understanding of this message, what it is and what it really has to say to
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   us.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.320]   So I have been holding before you some of the great descriptions which are given in
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.200]   the New Testament itself of the gospel.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.280]   If you really want to know what the gospel is, you have got to come to the New Testament.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   You do not go to the newspapers for that.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.000]   Many people do, I know, and they go to other places, television and so on.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.600]   But there you are generally given what somebody thinks it is.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.160]   The only thing to do is to go to the New Testament.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.320]   This is the authority, our only authority.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.920]   It is here we read of the beginning of the church, the message that was preached.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.480]   Here we find then the description and the essence of the gospel.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.800]   And I have been holding these great terms before you.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   Now we have come to this great statement in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.680]   Ephesians in the 19th verse, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.640]   I am an ambassador in bonds, says Paul.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.520]   He means by that that he was a prisoner at the time.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.960]   But he still could preach, he could do quite a lot in prison, and he did.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.280]   And what he wants to do, this was the great thrill of his life and the great ambition
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.920]   of his life to make known what he calls the mystery of the gospel.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.720]   We are dealing with this.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.200]   Why does he call it a mystery?
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.400]   What is the meaning of the New Testament term mystery?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.800]   Well, as I have been indicating, it means this.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:43.480]   As used in the New Testament, this is a technical term, and it means a secret hidden from men,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.080]   but which has nevertheless been revealed to men.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.840]   That is what it means.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.480]   Mystery in the New Testament does not mean that it is all vague, that it is all in a
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   mist as it were.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   It does not mean that at all.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.280]   Mystery in the New Testament means the thing itself is a secret, but God has been pleased
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.840]   and has chosen to reveal it, to make it manifest.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.680]   So it is the manifested secret.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.200]   And anybody who knows anything about the writings of this man, the apostle Paul, will know how
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.360]   proud he was of this.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.560]   He keeps on saying it, "Unto me," he says, "who am the least of all saints, was this
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.480]   great privilege given, that he might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.600]   of Christ," by which he means the mystery.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.560]   He talks about how the mystery had been revealed to him.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.040]   He would not have been a preacher but for that.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.080]   We know his story.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.320]   We know that he was probably the leading persecutor of the Christian Church, the ablest persecutor,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.560]   because he was, by nature and by training, such an outstanding man, a brilliant man,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.000]   and who had such knowledge.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.920]   And he was the chief persecutor of the Christian Church.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.600]   He did not know the mystery, you see.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.800]   But now the mystery was revealed to him, and he was commissioned to go out and to preach
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   it.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.160]   That is what he wants to do.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.560]   And we are looking at this great mystery.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.800]   Now we spend our first time in considering it, in just showing in general how of necessity
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.840]   it is a mystery.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.560]   I am reminding you of this because it is so important.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.920]   We should always start, when we come to the house of God or when we read the Bible, we
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.520]   should always start with this consideration uttermost in our minds, that we are now going
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:35.040]   to consider something that is altogether different from everything we have ever considered before.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.960]   You take up any other subject, well, of course, you come with your equipment, with your mind,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.280]   your brain, your understanding, your power of concentration.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.640]   If you are studying geometry, physics, chemistry, botany, studying law, studying philosophy,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.000]   studying anything you like, history, well, you want the equipment, and you bring it and
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.520]   you apply it, and the better your equipment, the more knowledge you will garner, the more
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.440]   information you will collect.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.560]   Now then, and it all in a sense depends upon you and your ability, but you know, when you
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.120]   come in here, when you take up your Bible, it is absolutely different.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   Well, it is because people do not realize that that they go around.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.040]   You are dealing here with a mystery.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.400]   And the first thing we therefore said about it was this.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:29.560]   Because it is by definition a mystery, our own natural abilities and propensities are
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.160]   really of no use to us.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.560]   What I mean by that is, they do not decide and determine whether we are going to understand
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.320]   or not.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.400]   The able man has no advantage here over the man who lacks ability.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.840]   None at all.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.200]   That is the glory of the gospel.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.440]   It is a mystery hidden from men.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.280]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.000]   That is, you see, where the mystery comes in.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.680]   It is beyond men's natural grasp and understanding.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.280]   It is revealed and no man can ever know it unless it be revealed to him by the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   Right.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.040]   We then went on last Sunday night to consider one aspect of this essential mystery which
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.520]   is revealed by God through the Spirit.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.780]   And that particular aspect that we considered, and we did so because it was Remembrance Sunday,
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.240]   when people are thinking of two world wars and how their loved ones have been killed
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   in the tragedy of war and men's stupidity in fighting, we considered the mystery of
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.360]   God's ways with respect to the world, His providence, the things He permits and allows,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.280]   and yet how behind it all there is a plan, there is a purpose, there is a movement of
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:53.440]   everything, that one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves because
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.260]   it is under the control and the governance of Almighty God.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.280]   We have therefore to consider the mystery of iniquity, as it is called in the Scriptures,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.680]   the power of the devil and evil, how it has come in and what it does, but how God overcomes
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.360]   it all in Christ and will finally destroy it.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:19.880]   But now tonight we come, in our consideration of this mystery of the Gospel, to what is
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.920]   after all the heart and the centre of the mystery.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:37.600]   And that is, as the Apostle Paul reminds Timothy, the mystery of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.800]   Christ and what is true of Him.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.640]   The Apostle is writing to Timothy, gives him instructions.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.120]   If a man desires the office of a bishop, an elder, he desires a good work, then he deals
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   with deacons.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   He is telling him how to conduct things in the Church of God.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.920]   Timothy was a kind of under-minister under the great Apostle, and the Apostle tells him
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   how to conduct.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.360]   "These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.160]   But if I tarry long, if I am hindered and can't come, that thou mayest know how thou
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:15.560]   artest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God."
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   What is the Church?
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   What's the business of the Church?
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:25.120]   "Oh," he says, "the church of the living God, which is the pillar and ground of the truth."
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.560]   The picture, this is a picture.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.080]   It was a way of making news known in those ancient times, when they hadn't got television
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.280]   and wireless and newspapers and so on.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.400]   But you see, they would erect a pillar and have a kind of board or slate on top of it,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.080]   and there they would put on this the announcement they want to make.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.360]   A ground, a base, and a pillar proclaiming truth.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.680]   That's what the Church is, says the Apostle.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.960]   It's the pillar and ground of the truth.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.840]   Well, what is the truth?
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   What does the Church proclaim?
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   Well, he goes on to say, and without controversy, beyond any dispute, "Great is the man of God
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   who is the mystery of godliness."
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   This is the message of the Church.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   What is it?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.520]   What is this mystery of godliness?
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:21.720]   The answer is, "God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.880]   unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.920]   That's the mystery of the faith.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.360]   This is the message that the Church is proclaiming.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.720]   This is the secret that the Church is to reveal to men and women.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.020]   The Apostle prays, asks these people to pray for him, that he may have power and boldness
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.280]   in the announcement of this.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.600]   And this is, of course, the essential mystery of the Gospel.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.440]   Now, it's here we see, more plainly perhaps than anywhere else, why when we come, as I
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   say, to consider this, we are doing something that is absolutely unique.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.960]   Christianity in the last resort is Christ.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.640]   It's all about this person, the person himself.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.040]   You see, the tragedy of today is that people will go on thinking of Christianity as just
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   a point of view.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.040]   What's Christianity to say about this, that, and the other?
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   And people are very interested and they argue about Christianity.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.320]   My dear friend, before you are concerned to consider what Christianity is to say about
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.280]   anything, here's the question.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.120]   What think ye of Christ?
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.280]   What is Christianity?
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.040]   And Christianity is not merely a point of view.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.640]   It's not merely a social or political or any other kind of teaching.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.680]   Christianity is about this, about this mystery, about this person, the mystery of this person.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.800]   And until we are clear about this, it doesn't matter what we think about anything else at
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   all.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:54.600]   I've often been asked, not often, but I've been asked many times to debate with people
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   about these things.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.400]   But you see, there's no point in debating with the men about the Christian attitude
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:06.080]   towards war or anything else until you and that man are agreed as to what Christianity
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   is.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.600]   And that's where so much time is wasted today.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.240]   The trouble with so many people is that they don't know what Christianity is in itself.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.520]   You can't be interested in its attitude until you know what it is.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.080]   And here we are told what it is.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:27.200]   And it is about this person himself, who he is, what he's done.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:35.520]   Now it's not at all surprising that the devil has always made his greatest attack just at
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.240]   this point.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.680]   This has been the thing that the devil has attacked in the long history of the Church
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.160]   more than anything else.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.640]   Now you can't even read your New Testament without knowing that.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.800]   Why did John write that Gospel of which we read a portion at the beginning tonight?
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.920]   Why did he ever write it?
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.320]   Well John, fortunately, has given us the answer to the question.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.800]   In the 20th chapter, almost at the end of the Gospel, he says this.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.360]   Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:18.680]   this book, but these are written, that he might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.840]   Son of God, and that believing he might have life through his name.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.320]   That's why he wrote his Gospel.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.880]   There were false teachers in the world then as there are now, who were saying that Jesus
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.100]   was not the Son of God.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.820]   The first attack was an attack upon the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.200]   He wrote his first epistle for exactly the same reason.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.960]   The first great problem the Christian Church had to face was various heresies with regard
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.240]   Obviously, because it's the whole of Christianity.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.120]   If you go wrong about this person, you're wrong everywhere.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.380]   Christianity is Christ.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.760]   Not only that, not only do you find that in the New Testament Scriptures, but if you read,
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.520]   take the trouble to read the history of the first four centuries or so of the Christian
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.020]   Church, you will find that a great battle was raging over this very question.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:27.040]   They called certain great councils, and these councils came to decisions and they drew up
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.120]   their creeds, which people still recite in certain parts of the Christian Church.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.040]   They recite the Apostles' Creed, the Athanasian Creed, the Nicene Creed, and so on.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   What are these creeds?
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.640]   Well, the answer is quite simple historically.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:50.000]   All sorts of false teachings arose which went astray about the person of the Lord Jesus
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Christ.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.400]   There are quite a number of them.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   I could give you a list of them.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.960]   You'll find them in your textbooks, either of church history or of the doctrine of the
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.440]   person of Christ.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:06.200]   All these twisted, perverted teachings about this person, and the church led by the Holy
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.160]   Spirit was given to see very clearly that this was a matter of life and death.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:18.120]   There was a man called Arius who rose and began to teach that Jesus was not the eternal
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.440]   Son of God, but that he was a created being under God, a very wonderful being of course,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.600]   but he wasn't the eternal Son of God.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.880]   He was a Christian, and the whole church almost was ready to listen to him and went after
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   him.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.920]   But thank God there was one man called Athanasius, raised by God, who stood against him and against
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.080]   the whole world, Athanasius Contramundum.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.160]   Under the power of the Spirit, this man was enabled to prevail.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:53.680]   All these great creeds are primarily and most essentially concerned to state and to defend
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.480]   the truth concerning the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.400]   If this battle hadn't been won, then there would be no such thing as Christianity.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.360]   And you'll find that in subsequent periods of the church, the battle has had to be fought
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.240]   all over again.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:17.800]   And alas, my dear friends, you and I are living in an age when it's got to be done once more.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.640]   And that is one of my reasons for calling your attention to all this, because this is
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   still the question.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.320]   Who is he?
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.480]   Who is this person?
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.560]   And you'll find that today, as in past ages, this is the point of attack.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.840]   There's nothing new about all this.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   It's so pathetic to think that people think they're modern and up-to-date because they
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.960]   deny the deity of Christ.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.840]   My dear friend, all that was done before the end of the first century.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.240]   I defy you to think of any new view of the person of Christ, but it wasn't considered
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.120]   in great detail in the first four centuries.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.520]   You're a little bit old-fashioned if you're still doing that.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.000]   Try to be up-to-date, my dear friend.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Try to be modern.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   That's old.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.960]   It's all been settled long ago, but they're still doing it.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   The sort of thing they're saying now is this.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.840]   Either they ignore the person altogether and just talk about Christian attitudes.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.120]   That's the commonest, I suppose, of all.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.320]   The person is not mentioned.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.560]   They're not interested.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.120]   The teaching, the attitude.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.280]   He himself is left out of sight.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.080]   Or they do talk of him, some of them, and what they say is this.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:33.960]   That Jesus was a man in whom more of God dwelt than any other man.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.160]   You see, only a man, but because he was such a good and religious man, there was more of
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   God in him than anybody else, so we must try to be like him.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.600]   Or as I've heard it put, and I'm quoting to you in all I'm saying now, I'm quoting from
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.480]   books that are just newly published and are very popular and claim to be right up to date.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.920]   Jesus achieved divinity, and we can all do it if we but follow him.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.240]   That is what we are supposed to do.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.920]   Well, these are some of the ways in which this great matter is being questioned and
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.480]   queried at this present time.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:15.600]   That is why it is absolutely vital that you and I should be clear about this, my friends.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.480]   There's only one hope for this world, I say.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.200]   There's only one salvation, and it's in this person.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.000]   And if we are not clear about him, we've got nothing.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.400]   We are left to despair without God, without hope in the world.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.560]   Very well, then.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.840]   What is our assertion?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:43.840]   Oh, we take our stand with the great apostles, and we say, "Great is the mystery of Godliness.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.400]   God was manifest in the flesh," and so on.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.000]   In other words, let me put it like this.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:59.840]   The Christian message, the gospel, is miraculous and supernatural from beginning to end.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.880]   And that is the most essential point of this mystery.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.800]   The gospel, I say, is not just a little bit different from every other teaching.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.720]   It has nothing in common with it.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.880]   It is unique.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.700]   It is a part.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.360]   It is the mind of God.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.960]   It is the wisdom of God.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.880]   It is the power of God.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.120]   This isn't man trying to arrive at an understanding.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:30.600]   It is God miraculously intervening, supernaturally entering into the problem of man in the world
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.360]   and doing his own work in this blessed person.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   Very well.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.960]   Now, then, you see, this is why it's so important to assert the mystery.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.480]   Let me put it before you.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   Do you know about this person?
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.400]   Have you been so busy in arguing about the Christian attitude to this or that that you
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.520]   really don't know the great central message itself?
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.620]   It is about this person.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.620]   What is this mystery?
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:03.920]   Well, now, let me establish for you, first of all, the fact of the mystery.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.400]   The sort of Christian I simply cannot understand at all—indeed, I almost query whether they
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.200]   are Christians for this reason—is the type of person who thinks that he's going to
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.600]   get converts or that he's going to help to make people Christian by bringing this
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.160]   mystery down to their level and saying, "Well, you needn't worry.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.200]   I know in the past they used to talk about miracles and the miraculous and the supernatural,
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.400]   but we no longer do that.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.280]   Now, you can believe our gospel now because, you see, it's just like your own teachings,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.840]   only that it's slightly different."
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.720]   That's a man to me who's denying the whole of the gospel.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.760]   I read this book and what do I find?
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:52.760]   Well, I find it asserting mystery, marvel, miracle everywhere from beginning to end.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   The New Testament is full of this.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:01.080]   Indeed, you get adumbrations of it and prophecies of it in the Old Testament.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.760]   That's why there is nothing more marvelous, perhaps, in the Old Testament than that great
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.640]   fortieth chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.080]   Listen to him bursting out, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.280]   Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished,
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.200]   that her iniquity is pardoned.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.840]   For she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins, the voice of him that crieth
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   in the wilderness.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:30.480]   Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.400]   Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.960]   The crooked shall be made straight and the rough way shall be made plain.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.520]   And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, the glory of the Lord."
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.280]   There's a prophecy of it.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.400]   It's going to be amazing, it's going to be wonderful.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:53.080]   "And all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.800]   The voice said, 'Cry,' and he said, 'What shall I cry?
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.520]   All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.360]   Grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.920]   Surely the people is grass.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.560]   Then all Zion that bringeth good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain,' and
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   so on.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.840]   Lift up thy voice, lift it up, be not afraid.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:22.120]   Say unto the cities of Judah, 'Behold your God.'"
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.960]   That's a prophetic anticipation of this amazing thing that is going to happen.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.880]   And it's full of marvel and miracle and wonder.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.680]   Never been anything like it before.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.640]   Everything absolutely new.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.680]   And you remember how, when you start reading your New Testament, the first person you come
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   across in a sense is John the Baptist.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.480]   And he says, "I am this voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.360]   I am the herald, the forerunner of this blessed person, this Messiah long expected."
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.540]   He's come.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.440]   This element of marvel and of wonder.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.120]   And you get it, as I say, running right through the whole of the New Testament.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:07.240]   Now, I've chosen just a few descriptions of this at random in order that, my dear friends,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.040]   we may get hold of this idea.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.920]   That you don't just come to listen to a moral bit of moral exhortation.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.560]   You don't come just to listen to a man who's going to tell you how to live.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.600]   I'm here to tell you of what God has done in his Son.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.560]   I'm here to tell you about the most exciting thing that has ever happened or ever can happen.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:31.720]   I'm here to proclaim a marvel, a miracle, God intervening in time.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:37.240]   And if we haven't got this sense of marvel and of mystery and of amazement, we know nothing
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   at all about Christianity.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.720]   So I've selected some of these things for you at random in order that you may grasp
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.400]   something of this mystery, this wonder.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.560]   Take for instance what we are told at the end of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.680]   It came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   doctrine.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.400]   All right, let's go on.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   Matthew 8, 27.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.360]   "Here is our Lord.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.440]   He has just quelled a great tempest in the sea.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.560]   He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.280]   But the men marveled, saying, 'What manner of men is this, that even the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:29.320]   and even the winds and the sea obey Him?'"
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   Let's go on.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   Matthew 9.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.720]   "Here again our Lord has worked another miracle.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.960]   Poor men carried in, suffering from the palsy, paralyzed, carried in by four men.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:48.600]   Suddenly at a word from our Lord, he says to the men, 'Son, be of good cheer.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.720]   Thy sins be forgiven thee.'
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.400]   And the men were healed.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.540]   This is what I read.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:02.280]   When the multitude saw it, they marveled and glorified God, which had given such power
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   unto men."
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.640]   In the same chapter in verse 33, "When the devil was cast out, the dumb speak, and the
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.880]   multitude marveled, saying, 'It was never so seen in Israel.'"
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.800]   I'm simply choosing these things at random.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.240]   Listen to this one out of the 21st chapter of this Gospel according to St. Matthew, and
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.960]   I read in verse 20.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.540]   This was the, "Our Lord causing a fig tree to wither.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:40.840]   When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How soon is the fig tree withered
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.000]   away?'"
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.840]   But listen to this, which is again perhaps still more interesting and important from
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   this point.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.200]   "Here is our Lord confuting some very clever people who came with a catch question to him.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:00.440]   When they heard these words, they marveled and left him and went their way."
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.960]   This is the thing, you see, that one keeps on reading everywhere as one goes through
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   the Scriptures.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.000]   Mark has got exactly the same thing in the fifth chapter of Mark's Gospel in verse 20.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.240]   I read this, "And he departed."
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   This is a man healed of a legion of devils that had been inhabiting him.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.160]   "He departed and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him."
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.960]   "And all men did marvel."
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.040]   This is the thing that one reads everywhere.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:38.240]   And then there is the most extraordinary statement of it all, which we find when our Lord enters
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.420]   into Jerusalem.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:48.720]   We are told that when he arrived in the city, the whole city was moved.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:56.280]   And everybody began to ask the one great question, "Who is this?"
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.320]   Now you see, that is how the New Testament presents this matter.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.680]   And on it goes.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.000]   I could quote you from the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.060]   He had this effect upon people even when he was quite a child, when he was quite a boy.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.000]   We read about him, "And this is what we are told.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.360]   And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds."
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.560]   That was the moment he was born.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.840]   We read later on the same thing, "Joseph and Mary marveled at those things which were
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.600]   spoken of him."
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.360]   Now that is the characteristic of the Gospels.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.680]   But I am concerned to demonstrate this.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   This is equally true of the life of the early Church.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.000]   And a Church which does not give this impression of marvel, mystery, amazement, is a Church
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   which is failing.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Look at it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   On the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, here are these people, 120 of them, gathered together
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.800]   in an upper room, and suddenly the Holy Spirit comes upon them.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:59.120]   And then these people begin to speak in strange tongues, and the thing was noised abroad,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.400]   and the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   his own language.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   Listen.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:13.480]   "And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, 'What is this?'
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   And so it continues.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.960]   Peter and John go up into the temple one afternoon, and there is a layman laid at the gate of
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   the temple.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.680]   They look at him and they say, 'In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!'
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.440]   And he sprang to his feet immediately.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.600]   His feet and ankle bones received strength, and he went walking and leaping and praising
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.840]   God into the temple."
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   And this is the effect it had.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.880]   "And as the layman which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.080]   unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wandering.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.200]   And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, 'Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   at this?
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.240]   Or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power and holiness we had made
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.680]   this man to walk?
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.160]   The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.520]   determined to let him go.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.840]   But God raised him up and so on."
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:15.880]   Now I think I'm demonstrating to you and establishing that this is the great characteristic
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.280]   of the Christian message.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.080]   We read of the authorities when they listened to Peter and John.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   We read when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:33.000]   and ignorant men, they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Jesus.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Now all this is just indicative of what the apostle says in writing to Timothy, "Great
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.200]   is the mystery of godliness."
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   This is a marvel.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.720]   The New Testament is full of this.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.000]   The early Christians were a phenomenon.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.760]   Men and women didn't think of Christianity in those days as just a different point of
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   view or teaching.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   It was full of miracles, of marvels, of wonders, of astonishing, incredible things.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.520]   That is Christianity, the mystery, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.520]   Very well, let me ask a question then.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.040]   Why is it a mystery?
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.600]   What is the essence of this mystery?
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.920]   And the answer is all to be found in this blessed person.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:24.200]   Jesus of Nazareth, the one about whom this message is, was not just a great or an unusual
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.200]   man.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.920]   That isn't what it says about him.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.520]   He was unique.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.840]   He was different.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   He stands alone.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.680]   He mustn't be put into any category.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   That's the message.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:43.480]   This is where you get this mystery showing itself in its most vital point.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   How does it do it?
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.240]   Well, let me put it before you.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.880]   These are the facts.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.760]   The mystery lies, you see, in the apparent contradictions.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.320]   And that is why people are so baffled when they read the New Testament.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.040]   They say, "I don't understand this."
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.640]   Of course you don't understand it.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.720]   You are confronted by a mystery, my friend.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.680]   It is the mystery of godliness.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.720]   Now let me show you the contradictions.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.800]   You go back to the beginning of the gospels, and as I've reminded you, you start in the
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.280]   realm of miracle.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:26.000]   It all starts with Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.480]   And we are told it in an apparently most ordinary manner.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.600]   There was a certain priest named Zacharias of the castle of Dion.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.520]   His wife was one of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.800]   They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.560]   the Lord, blameless.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.440]   They had no child because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both now well stricken in years.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   And this is it.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.080]   This is typical gospel.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.280]   If you want to know what Christianity is, listen to this.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.600]   This is how it happened.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:01.200]   It came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God, in the order
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.400]   of his course, according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.360]   incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.040]   And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.920]   He'd done it many times before.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.120]   He went in not expecting anything to happen, just the ordinary course of events.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.320]   And you see, that's how people think that life is.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   There's no miraculous.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.240]   They say science has disproved the miraculous.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   Things like that don't happen.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   That's fairy tale.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   That's fantasy.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.360]   But, my dear friend, you know, if that were true, there never would have been a Christian
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.880]   message to preach.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   This is Christianity.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.680]   He went in, and the whole multitude of the people were without at the time praying.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.120]   There appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.280]   incense.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.000]   And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.720]   That's how it all begins.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.280]   Now you're already in the realm of the miraculous.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.720]   You are already in the realm of the spiritual.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.320]   You are already in the realm of the supernatural.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.360]   It's no use bringing your understanding here.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.840]   It's no use saying, "I'm a man of learning.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   I'm a man of science.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.840]   I'm a philosopher."
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.720]   No, my dear friend, it's useless.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   You're already lifted into the realm of miracles, into the realm of angels, into the realm of
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:35.480]   spirit, into the realm of God, into the realm of the supernatural.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.400]   And if you don't recognize that, you know nothing about Christianity.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.960]   There would never have been a message to preach.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   And these men who talk about Christian attitudes and Christian teaching, who deny this, are
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.600]   not talking about Christianity.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.160]   They're talking about some religion which they call Christianity.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   It isn't Christianity.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.800]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:01.240]   This is the thing that is held up by the pillar and the ground of the truth.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.360]   And of course, you remember the rest of that story.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:11.840]   Well then, the next item is, "After those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.200]   herself five months.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:23.160]   Then in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee called
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:28.520]   Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.960]   the virgin's name was Mary.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.600]   And the angel said unto her, 'Hail thou that art highly favored.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:41.200]   The Lord is with thee and makes the announcement of the birth of the Son of God from her out
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   of her womb.'"
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.240]   Angel?
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.880]   Miracle?
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Mary can't believe it.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.200]   She says, "What are you talking about?
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.560]   How can this be, seeing that I know not a man?
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.560]   I'm a virgin," she says.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.000]   "I have never known a man.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.840]   I'm not a married woman.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.680]   How can I have a child when I'm single and I'm a virgin?
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   It's impossible."
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:11.520]   Mary, you see, said the very thing that people are saying today.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.600]   She stumbles at the miraculous and the supernatural.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.240]   She denies it.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.120]   She's ready to reject it, and yet she's given to see it's true and it happens.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.280]   In the same way, an angel appeared to Joseph and told him not to put her away, that this
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.120]   wasn't faithlessness on her part, that she hadn't let him down and had been having a
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.800]   secret meeting with another man.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   No, no.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.860]   He says, "This is of the Holy Ghost."
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.800]   But it took an angel to tell him.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.600]   The whole thing is miraculous from beginning to end.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.920]   Then you remember the story about him.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   That's his birth.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.660]   I'm simply running over these things for you to see that the whole thing is a mystery from
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.660]   beginning to end.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.400]   At the age of twelve, you see him in the temple.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.960]   He'd gone up with his people to some great occasion in Jerusalem, and they were now going
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   back.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.640]   The caravans were traveling back, and after two or three days, they looked for him and
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   they couldn't find him.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.400]   So, they had to go all the way back to Jerusalem to look for him, and they found him in the
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.640]   temple arguing and disputing with the doctors of the law.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.760]   And he was turning the tables on them.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.680]   What we read is, "All that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers."
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.720]   A boy of twelve, he's able, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.080]   asking them questions.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.480]   They couldn't understand him.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.840]   They couldn't explain this extraordinary child.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.840]   "Let me hurry on.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   Think of his teaching.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   Look at his authority."
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.120]   This is what the people said when they heard him.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.880]   "This man speaks with authority, not as the scribes."
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.640]   The Pharisees said, "How is this man learning, never having learned?"
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.920]   Soldiers were sent to arrest him one day, and they listened to his sermon, and they
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.680]   said, "Never men speak like this man."
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.680]   Listen to his claims.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.320]   He says, "You have heard it has been said by them of old time.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.120]   I say unto you, he speaks with authority.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   His exposition of the law was something that no Pharisee could follow, nor understand.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.720]   They'd never heard anything like it.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.200]   But above everything else, look at the claim he makes.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.320]   He goes to a number of fishermen and he says, 'Come, follow me.'"
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.680]   He's a man who asks for a totalitarian allegiance.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.120]   He claims all power and understanding, and he asks for men and women to leave everything
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.280]   and to follow him.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:31.320]   He then makes prophecies about the future of Jerusalem and the temple, and about himself.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.920]   And he does it with absolute confidence, and it's all fulfilled and verified.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.880]   Who is this?
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:47.440]   And then those extraordinary actions of his called miracles.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.280]   You say, "I don't believe in miracles.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.520]   I belong to the scientific age."
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:57.280]   My dear friend, science has got nothing to do with these matters.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   The New Testament puts the miracles before you.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.320]   John calls them signs.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.720]   He says they mean that they prove that he is what he claimed to be.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.840]   There never would have been a Christian message, a Christian gospel, if he hadn't worked miracles.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   He did.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.760]   The people went home saying, "We have seen strange things today.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.040]   They marvel that God had given such power to men."
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.760]   He became a phenomenon.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.720]   This carpenter, this ignorant person, as it were, he's got knowledge, he's got power.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.160]   "The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the deaf are made to hear, even the
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   dead are raised.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.640]   He calms the storm at sea, he can stop the wind.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.560]   There is nothing that he cannot do.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.120]   Works, signs, miracles, marvels.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.640]   Who is this?"
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.560]   And yet, you see, that's not the whole truth about him.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.080]   There's another side, and this is where the mystery comes in.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:42:00.440]   This extraordinary person was born in a stable and put in a manger.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.000]   He lived in great poverty.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.240]   He had to work with his hands as a carpenter.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.800]   Same person.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.520]   And he went on living like that for thirty years.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   And then you see him starting in his public ministry, and you're struck by his meekness,
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   his humility.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   He knew what it was to be tired.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.480]   We are told in the fourth chapter of John's Gospel that one afternoon he was too tired
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.120]   to walk into the neighboring city with the disciples to buy provisions.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:41.480]   He just sat by a side of the well, tired, weary.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.560]   He had need of prayer.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.840]   He spent a lot of his time in praying unto God.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.760]   "This man," they say, "who can work these miracles, stop the raging of the sea, quell
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   the wind."
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.520]   Yes, but he was arrested in apparent weakness.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.120]   He was crucified in weakness.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.600]   He cries out, "I thirst."
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.960]   He cries out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.880]   He dies.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.600]   They took down his body and they buried it in a grave.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.000]   These are absolute facts, all of them.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.800]   And they rolled a stone over the grave and put a seal on it and put soldiers to guard
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   it.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   This is the problem.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.960]   The might, the power, the authority, the weakness, the helplessness, the death, the shame, the
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:39.720]   agony, the burial, the grave.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.640]   But you see, it doesn't stop there.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.040]   He arose, the grave was empty, he appears.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.920]   The whole, everything about this man is full of mystery, marvel, unexpectedness, apparent
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:57.880]   contradictions, great, small, mighty, weak.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:04.720]   Is it surprising that when he entered Jerusalem that last time that the whole city was moved
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   and people said, "Who is this?"
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.200]   This is the great question.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.080]   "Who is this?
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.160]   What is this man?"
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.760]   He seems to know everything, and yet he's apparently so weak and he's so helpless.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.480]   Here is the great question, my dear friend.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.200]   Have you ever faced this problem?
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   Have you ever faced this person?
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   This is the great matter of Christianity.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:35.280]   Forget I say for the moment your attitude towards bombs, war, South Africa, and all
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.480]   the rest of it that people seem to think is Christianity.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.080]   Here is the question, "What think ye of Christ?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   Who is he?
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.240]   Whose son is he?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.800]   What is he?"
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.080]   And there's only one answer to the question.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:58.120]   It is the answer that is given here by the Apostle Paul in this great and astonishing
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.160]   word of his to his disciple, young follower, Timothy.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.240]   "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.800]   That's the only explanation.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.200]   And it's not surprising that this man of old puts it like this.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:20.640]   This is the man I've reminded you who was a great Pharisee and who hated everything
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.480]   he heard about this Jesus and all his followers, who regarded it as blasphemy.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.880]   This fellow, this man, this one who claims that he's son of God and equal with God,
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:37.600]   he hated him and he did his utmost to exterminate him and his memory and his following and everything
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.320]   connected with him.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   He didn't understand him and none of the other Pharisees understood him and none of
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.600]   the great men of the world understood him.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.080]   The princes of this world, says Paul to the Corinthians, didn't know him for if they
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.240]   had known him they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.000]   They all looked at him and they said, "It's just a man and he's an imposter.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.440]   He's a dangerous man."
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:09.240]   The Jewish authorities, Caiaphas, their priest, he was a very subtle and a clever politician.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   He said, "You know, this is going to be rather useful," he said.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:21.680]   "If we let the Roman authorities execute this man, we'll save the nation.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.200]   It's better," he says, "that one should die than that the whole nation should suffer."
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.800]   How clever he thought he was.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   He regarded him as just a man, you see.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.360]   He was a political agitator in the eyes of Caiaphas.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.000]   Many people have thought of him in the same way since.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.800]   They still think of him as a social reformer, a politician, and so on.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.520]   But oh, the tragedy of this mistake.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.400]   That's what they all thought and that's what Paul thought.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.240]   Saul of Tarsus thought the same thing.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:53.360]   When he was going down that road from Jerusalem to Damascus that day, when suddenly about
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:47:01.040]   midday he saw a light in the heaven passing the brightest shining of the sun, and a blessed
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.840]   face in the light.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.320]   Looking down upon him with compassion and mercy and saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutes
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.920]   thou me?
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.400]   It is hard for thee to kick against the bricks."
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.840]   And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.760]   It was obvious that it was some Lord, some God.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.000]   He'd never seen such a face.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.520]   He'd never seen such glory.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   He'd never seen such beauty, such wonder.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.560]   "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.760]   And back came that answer that he never got over.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:38.280]   "I am Jesus, the Jesus whom thou art persecuting."
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.880]   Not surprising that he said, "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.720]   You see, he'd looked at him and had seen only a man.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.120]   He knows now he's the Lord of glory.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.480]   And that's what he says here in writing to Timothy.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.320]   It's the same thing he says.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:01.840]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.560]   This is the mystery of the message.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.240]   This is the mystery of the gospel.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.800]   That there you look at a person, Jesus of Nazareth, one person.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:18.160]   But in that one person there are two natures, God and man.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:24.200]   They're both there at the same time, and they're both unmixed.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.960]   You remember how John puts it in the prologue of his gospel, "In the beginning was the
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.640]   Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.800]   And the Word was made flesh and tabernacled amongst us.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:43.280]   He was manifest in the flesh.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   What's it mean?
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.360]   What it means is this.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.840]   That that person whom you're looking at and whom you think at first sight is nothing but
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:58.840]   a man is at the same time the eternal Son of God.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.320]   This is the mystery of godliness.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:08.920]   God the Son was made visible, was manifest in the flesh.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:14.200]   In the babe in the manger, in the boy arguing in the temple, in the carpenter, in the young
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.920]   man setting out in his public ministry at the age of thirty.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.200]   This is God, eternal Son of God.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:29.300]   The Word that was in the beginning with God, manifest in the flesh, appearing in this world
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.000]   as a man.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.880]   That's the mystery of godliness.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.600]   So when you believe that, you never do again what they're so fond of doing today.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.400]   They say the great teachers of the world are the following.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:58.800]   Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Jesus, Augustine, Luther, Calvin,
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   and so on.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.200]   That's a lie.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:09.960]   If you put him into any list, you don't know anything about the mystery of godliness.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:14.720]   These were all great men, thank God for them, but they were all men.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:21.800]   Here is God the Son, manifest in the flesh.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.880]   Now my friend, it really comes to this.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:31.680]   The mystery of godliness is that the eternal Son of God has left the courts of heaven and
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.080]   has come into the world as a babe, as a man.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.640]   In that one person there are two natures.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.960]   You say I don't understand that.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.960]   Of course you don't.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.400]   Didn't I start by saying that this is mystery?
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.440]   This is marvel.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.440]   This is miracle.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.280]   You see, the fatal error is to think that he's only a man, a great and exceptional
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   human teacher.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   He isn't.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:01.640]   Poor old Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.960]   When he saw it, when the mystery was made plain to him, he put it like this.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:11.280]   God hath visited and has redeemed his people.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   This is the thing.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.920]   This is no longer a man with a greater insight than others pointing the way to God.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.280]   It is God coming down in the person of his own Son in order to rescue us and redeem us
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.080]   and to save us from ourselves.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:33.760]   So in this one person you have the divine and the human.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:39.360]   You have God manifest in the flesh.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.040]   And that's why I'm here as a preacher and this is my privilege to say that this old
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:49.560]   sinful damned world that is hurtling itself to destruction, it can be saved.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.360]   God has sent his Son into it.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.640]   It's entirely of God.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.800]   You can't understand it.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.600]   Of course you can't.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   What's the use of a human brain when you're confronted by the person of Jesus Christ,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.360]   God and man?
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.600]   The pattern contradictions, the strength and the weakness, it's all explained by this.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.640]   Two natures in one person.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.920]   He has humbled himself in order to save us.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:27.360]   He has taken on our human nature in order that he may take upon him our sin and bear
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:32.920]   its punishment and thereby reconcile us to God and open the way to heaven and the blessings
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.800]   of God upon us.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.840]   God manifest in the flesh, justified by the Spirit.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.520]   The Spirit vindicated him.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.520]   How?
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.320]   Well, the Spirit descended upon him in the shape of a Dovertis baptism.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.840]   And John the Baptist saw it.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:54.200]   The Spirit justified him, vindicated his claims.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.720]   And the Spirit came into his human nature and enabled him to work his miracles.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:05.140]   It was by the eternal Spirit that he offered himself unto God on the cross.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:10.000]   It was by the power of the Spirit that he rose from the grave in the resurrection and
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.440]   thereby is declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.280]   by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.800]   Scene of angels.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   Yes, they saw him before he was born.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.640]   They could make the announcement.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.160]   They went to the shepherds in the field and told them about him.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.480]   Angels around about him at his birth, watching him, guarding him, making proclamations concerning
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   him.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.100]   He is tempted of the devil forty days and forty nights in the wilderness.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.000]   The devil left him and angels ministered unto him.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.400]   They are with him in the garden.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.880]   They are with him at the end.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.920]   They are with him in the resurrection.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:58.120]   They are with him in the ascension.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   Scene of angels.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:11.040]   And there he is ascending from earth into heaven in the presence of his disciples.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.920]   And the angels that were looking on came to these men and said, "Ye men of Galilee, why
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:21.440]   stand ye here looking up into heaven?"
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:31.800]   The same Jesus that you have just seen ascending into heaven shall come again from heaven.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:42.000]   Scene of angels preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.520]   the glory.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:52.960]   That is the mystery of godliness, that is the mystery of the gospel.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.920]   You see, the gospel is not a message telling you and telling me how to live and how to
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:02.440]   live a better life and telling us that if we do certain things we will satisfy God and
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.760]   we will make ourselves Christians and all will be well with us.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.280]   That isn't it at all.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.960]   The message is the exact opposite.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:16.520]   It is that because we are so helpless and can do nothing, the Son of God was sent by
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.080]   the Father out of heaven into this world.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.960]   A mystery, a marvel, an enigma.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.040]   There has never been anything like it, there never will be.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.280]   It's unique, it's absolutely a part.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.360]   But that is God's way of salvation.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:40.880]   And especially when he sends him to the cross and punishes him for our sins, oh, the mystery
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:45.200]   of that, God willing I hope to deal with it next Sunday night.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:50.560]   But there it is, it's mystery, it's marvel, it's miracle from beginning to end.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:58.480]   My dear friend, leave your petty understanding, it's a hindrance to you.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:06.560]   And as this blessed person himself said, "Except he be converted and become as little children,
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.120]   he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.960]   You are confronted by a mystery.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.960]   Have you seen it?
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:17.000]   Has the secret been made known to you?
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:24.400]   Do you now realize and see that you are saved by this person?
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:30.200]   That he didn't come to tell you how to save yourself, he came to save you.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.960]   Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:41.440]   Great is the mystery of godliness without controversy, beyond dispute and argument.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.240]   The thing is glorious, it's God, it's divine, it's eternal.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:55.840]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:07.920]   the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into the glory.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.160]   Have you got the wonder, the marvel, the amazement of it?
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.360]   Are you astounded, are you humbled?
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:25.840]   The Christian is a man who, like Saul of Tarsus, face to face with him has only got one thing
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:34.200]   to say, "What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?"
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:44.240]   And his answer is, "Nothing, except to believe that I am the Son of God, and that I came
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:54.600]   into the world and lived and died and rose again in order to save you, that your sins
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:04.800]   might be forgiven, that you might become a new man in me."
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.360]   Amen.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:11.280]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
