[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Hi, Jeremy and Jono here from Fast.ai and we're here to tell you about this new course
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.400]   that we're starting.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.720]   It's the first Fast.ai course in a long time.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.280]   And the reason it's been so long is because we've wanted to create something that is truly
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.600]   AI native, that is, you know, really makes sense in this new world that we're in.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.840]   And to be honest, it's taken us a long time to figure out what the hell to do, but we
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.900]   think we've got something you're going to really like.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.960]   So the exciting feature of the AI filled world that Jeremy mentioned is that more and more
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.680]   people than ever are starting to code.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.160]   They're using language models to generate their first ever projects, their first ever
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.440]   websites.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.520]   And this is really great.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.840]   We love to see what people are doing.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.640]   But there is also something that we've noticed, which is that when you're able to generate
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   these giant pieces of code that you don't necessarily understand, there can be a wall
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640]   that you hit.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640]   You get really excited.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.200]   You add more and more features and then suddenly you reach a point where, oh gosh, I can't
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.280]   edit this or I don't understand where to go next.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.680]   And even though today's AIs are amazing and they are probably only going to get better,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.640]   there's still some things that they can't fix either.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.680]   So that's the problem that we've been seeing.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.760]   And what it turns into is a lot of people thinking, gee, this coding thing must not
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   even be for me, right?
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.320]   Even though I've got all these amazing tools, I clearly must be missing something because
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.480]   I still can't get it to do exactly what I want.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.120]   But it's not your fault, right?
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120]   Exactly.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.720]   So that's what our course is hoping to address.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.800]   We think we've got a different way of building up to coding with language models that doesn't
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.460]   leave you in that helpless position with a bunch of code you don't understand.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460]   And so that's what we'd like to try and teach you.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.440]   In fact, it's more than we think we know.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   We do know.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.400]   We have actually been using this new process and new tool we're going to be teaching you
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.120]   about ourselves for the last few months.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.160]   I've been using it for all my work and I am dramatically more effective and productive
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.720]   than I was.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.840]   So this is not just for fairly new programmers.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.040]   I think experienced programmers who are looking to understand how to combine their expertise
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.320]   with AI better will also appreciate this.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.680]   Start joining the course if you've never coded before.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.240]   You should know about variables.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.360]   You should know about loops.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.200]   You should know about if statements and be able to do some basic stuff in Python.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.400]   But you don't need too much more than that.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.360]   We're going to show you a new way to solve problems with code that doesn't require a
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.660]   computer science degree, that leverages AI, but as you use our approach, you're going
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.080]   to be learning more and more about coding.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.960]   And this approach is one where you'll be using AI, not just to build stuff, but to actually
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.700]   become a better coder as you do.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.440]   It'll be all based on the classic fast AI teaching style where you'll be building stuff
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.060]   from day one, very, very hands on.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:06.080]   And in the process, you'll be learning a lot of really powerful techniques and foundations.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.640]   So the way this course is going to work, it's going to take a little bit of unlearning.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.560]   I think if some of us have habits of generating a ton of code all at once, it's very much
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.440]   building up these muscles of gradually, iteratively, line by line, step by step, putting together
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.340]   things that you want.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.800]   So we're going to be doing it as a live course together.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.200]   I think twice a week for eight weeks, we'll have lessons, but they'll also be office hours.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.640]   And it's a live cohort, which means there'll be hundreds of other learners also building
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.560]   these muscles together and practicing and figuring out this way of approaching problems.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.320]   And we'll be doing this in a custom tool that we've built to work well with this approach.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.480]   So I think it's going to be an exciting group to be a part of as we try and figure out these
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.920]   approaches together.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.080]   And I should also mention, we're treating this as a beta course.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.520]   So you should join if you're prepared to be involved in something that's being a bit built
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.920]   around you as it happens, it'll be the first time this has ever happened.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.240]   I will say all the folks who were involved in the very first ever fast AI course, most
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.400]   of them I still know to this day.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.680]   Most of them have gone on to have extremely successful careers as startup founders and
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.640]   in research labs and so forth.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.280]   I think this will be a bit like that, you know, although the old days of fast AI is
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.440]   something very new, very fresh, not quite complete.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.720]   So it might require a little bit of patience and a little bit of enthusiasm to be part
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.280]   of the journey that we're all taking together.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.680]   So if this sounds like something that's for you, then can't wait to see you there.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.640]   And we'll all learn how to solve it with code.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   Thanks, Joanna.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   Thank you.
