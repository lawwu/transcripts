[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   I'm curious whether or not we can just touch on a few of the things that a lot of people
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.040]   wonder about in terms of egg quality.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.080]   And if they touch on sperm quality, maybe we can also just mention that.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:24.100]   But for instance, does cannabis, either by edible or by smoking cannabis, impact egg
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.040]   quality in either direction?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.520]   Alcohol would be the next.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.660]   And then I'm going to assume, and I have to do this strictly because of what I understand
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.840]   about drugs of abuse like cocaine and amphetamine, methamphetamine, that none of those can be
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.680]   good for systems of the body because they create so much stress for the body.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.500]   But let's just say alcohol and cannabis.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.240]   I read a statistic when researching the episode on cannabis that shocked me, which is that
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:02.140]   15%, 1.5%, not 1.5, 15% of American women, at least in this one study, survey, reported
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.000]   having consumed or smoked cannabis during known pregnancy, which is wild.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Wild.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.640]   Unless, of course, I'm just naive and THC is not harmful to the fetus, but I have a
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.400]   hard time believing that.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.960]   So what gives?
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.760]   And there, I actually just threw in fetal development.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.140]   So is cannabis, is alcohol bad for egg quality?
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.920]   So they're different things and they're the same thing in one.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.400]   So let's answer them each individually.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.760]   So we'll go with the one that everybody knows and has accepted now that they wouldn't have
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.440]   accepted 40 years ago, right?
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   Smoking cigarettes.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.480]   So that's obviously bad.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.560]   Decreases the number of eggs you have in the vault.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.160]   Smoking cigarettes actually gets into your vault, decreases the number that you have.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.880]   You have a higher chance of going into menopause earlier, and it increases the risk of having
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.120]   abnormal chromosomes, which is what we really think about when we think about egg quality,
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   right?
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.760]   Impacting those meiotic spindles inside the eggs, which hold the chromosomes in their
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.480]   perfect position.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.840]   They are associated, they get wear and tear from things that cause inflammation or are
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   toxic.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.800]   So cigarette smoke, we know, decreases egg quality, egg quantity, increases miscarriage,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.960]   and then, of course, has fetal impacts.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.760]   Could I just ask you, because when we talk about – there's nicotine, which itself
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.040]   is not carcinogenic, and then there's the smoking process, which brings in a bunch of
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   other things.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.600]   The question I know is burning in everybody's mind is vaping, right?
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.000]   Because vaping is – I'm very bullish on this.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.400]   I mean, it's very clear that the chemicals associated with vaping are just oh so bad
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   for everybody's health, but it's distinctly different from saying that nicotine is bad
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   for one's health.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   I mean, it can be, but without doing too much of a deep dive, are there any data that show
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.840]   that vaping is bad for egg quality?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   Of course, there's not as much data because it just hasn't been around as long, but yes,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.080]   vaping definitely has chemicals that looks like it's associated with poor success rates
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.200]   in IVF cycles.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.800]   And that's really kind of one of the most finite measures of egg quality we can see
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.360]   because we're really testing the egg at a level in a lab versus just are you getting
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   pregnant naturally.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.880]   And sorry to interject again, but any time a conversation like this comes up, especially
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.080]   between two people in the health science space, there are these shouts because I hear them
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.520]   literally, where people say, "Well, listen, I vaped every day and I've had three healthy
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   babies."
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.840]   And I think my response is always, okay, there's going to be a distribution of responses.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.560]   And then, of course, how much healthier could your babies have been had you not vaped during
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.840]   pregnancy or vaped prior to pregnancy or – I mean, I think these are the key issues that
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.480]   like you can't rewind the clock as far as I know, right, in the absence of a time machine.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   You can't rewind the clock.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.800]   So I mean, basically everything you're saying is that smoking cigarettes or vaping nicotine
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.840]   just can't be good for egg quality.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   We know that.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.040]   We know that it's not good for getting pregnant.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.400]   We know that it's not good for sperm.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.000]   And therefore, we also know it's going to impact pregnancy rates.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.040]   Things like cannabis, right, decreases sperm production, decreases sperm motility, changes
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.880]   sperm morphology, the shape of it, changes the DNA, increases the fragmentation of the
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   DNA.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.520]   If your partner uses cannabis and you get pregnant, you have a higher chance of miscarriage
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.720]   because of the sperm association with the cannabis.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   Now –
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   Edible cannabis as well as smoked cannabis.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.920]   I don't know, right, because you can't study something that's illegal.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.760]   So a lot of this data is just more new and a lot of it's going to be observational.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.380]   Even in states like Colorado and California where cannabis is essentially legal, I'm
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.760]   assuming there are more data.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:52.500]   But okay, so smoking and/or vaping nicotine, cannabis, either edible or smoked, very likely
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.600]   detrimental to egg quality and sperm quality, which is not to say that one can't conceive.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.480]   It just means that the quality of your baby, your child, will not be as high as the quality
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.680]   of that baby if you didn't do that.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   Is that right?
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.000]   And I'm not trying to demonize anyone that did do this during pregnancy.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.360]   A lot of people didn't know.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.000]   But this is really about people trying to make choices in anticipation of future pregnancy.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.320]   And when you're trying to set yourself up for success, because we know infertility is becoming
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   more common.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.800]   We don't always know who is going to have it.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.200]   And when you find yourself in that position specifically, you now want to optimize everything
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   you can.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.360]   So if there's something that is going to make the sperm quality worse and the egg quality
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.640]   worse and your success with treatment lower and your miscarriage rate higher, we're going
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.580]   to recommend that you not do it.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.920]   If you're trying to get pregnant naturally, all these things correlate over.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.360]   But of course, there's always going to be outliers and exceptions.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.340]   I'm going to sit here and tell you that the odds of getting pregnant at age 43 are less
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.160]   than 3% per month.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.880]   And every single person is going to be like, "But my Aunt Barbara or I know this person
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.560]   who did," because 3% is not zero.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   And you're talking about natural pregnancy there by intercourse.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.440]   Old-fashioned way, yes.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   Right.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.160]   But yes, so people will get pregnant.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.240]   People will have healthy children who do have exposures to nicotine, to cannabis, even to
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   alcohol.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.980]   Even though we know that alcohol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, 0% of alcohol should
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.720]   be the acceptable level in pregnancy.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.040]   And then does alcohol impact fertility?
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.680]   Such a complicated question, and this is probably due to the amount you consume and the frequency
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.760]   of which you consume it.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.600]   Alcohol is a toxin that your liver must filter out, and we know it causes inflammation.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.200]   Anybody who's had a fun night with alcohol knows they can wake up the next day and they
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.840]   feel different.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.720]   Their body is processing that alcohol.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.480]   And that inflammation, especially if it's chronic, chronic exposure, we know chronic
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.560]   inflammation is one of the things that we see impacting egg quality and sperm quality.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.740]   So certainly if you enjoy alcohol, it should be something that is done in moderation, one
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.520]   or two drinks a week at the most, and you should not do it at all once you find out
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.300]   you're pregnant.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:17.420]   [MUSIC]
