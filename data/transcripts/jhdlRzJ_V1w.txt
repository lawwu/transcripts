[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   We have a heavy question today
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.940]   about unalleviated chronic pain.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.800]   And it comes from an anonymous man
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.560]   who listens to the podcast.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.320]   Pastor John, hello, thank you for this podcast
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   My mother, a believer, struggles with debilitating,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.740]   very debilitating nerve pain
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.040]   and can get no medical relief
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.380]   from anything doctors have tried.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.160]   She suffers endlessly.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.760]   How does such unalleviated suffering glorify God
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.700]   when it seems that God refuses to answer
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.120]   any of our prayers for mercy?
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.720]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.000]   On the night before Jesus' crucifixion,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.760]   after Judas had gone out,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.340]   Peter said to Jesus,
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600]   "Lord, where are you going?"
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.760]   And Jesus answered him, "Where I am going,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.600]   you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward."
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.880]   Peter said, "Lord, why can I not follow you now?
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.400]   I will lay down my life for you."
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.200]   And Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me?
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.660]   Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.520]   till you have denied me three times."
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.840]   And that is in fact what happened.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.280]   Peter denied three times that he knew Jesus
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.440]   and he wept bitterly as he realized the horror
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   of what he had done.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.240]   Now, it's several weeks later.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.040]   Jesus has risen from the dead.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.400]   He's on the beach at Sea of Galilee with his apostles
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.360]   and he focuses attention on Peter
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.200]   who had failed so badly three times.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.840]   And he draws out of Peter
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.260]   three corresponding affirmations of love
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.620]   that rectify his three denials.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.260]   Here's the way John described it.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.620]   Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John,
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.900]   do you love me more than these?"
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.460]   He said, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.620]   He said, "Feed my lambs."
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.820]   He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John,
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.580]   do you love me?"
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.780]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.580]   He said to him, "Shepherd my sheep."
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.740]   He said to him a third time, "Simon, son of John,
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.580]   do you love me?"
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.020]   Peter was grieved because he said to him a third time,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.020]   "Do you love me?"
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.140]   And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.620]   You know that I love you."
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.180]   Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.900]   And remember now, before Peter denied Jesus three times,
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.700]   Jesus had said, "You cannot follow me now.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.820]   You can't go with me where I'm going,
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.780]   but you will follow me afterward."
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.780]   And now we can see why Peter could not yet follow Jesus.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.740]   He didn't love him the way he should,
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.060]   but now Jesus has drawn out of Peter new,
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.020]   deeper, unshakable love.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.900]   He who has forgiven much loves much.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.980]   And then he says these ominous words.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.900]   And if you wonder, how does this relate to the question?
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.340]   Maybe you'll start to hear it.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.300]   When you were young, you used to dress yourself, Peter,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300]   walk wherever you wanted.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.940]   And when you are old, you're gonna stretch out your hands
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.660]   and another will dress you,
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.700]   carry you where you do not want to go.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.420]   Now he's speaking of his crucifixion,
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.420]   and so it adds this, verse 19, John 21, 19.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.100]   This he said to show by what kind of death
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.540]   he was to glorify God.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.260]   And after saying this, he said, "Follow me."
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.020]   In other words, Peter, now you're ready.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.420]   You are going to be crucified.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.820]   You're gonna follow me all the way, all the way down.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.460]   Once I said, "You cannot follow me now,"
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.420]   you couldn't because your love was defective.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.460]   But now you have said three times, and you are right.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.260]   I affirm it, you love me, your love is great for me.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.900]   Therefore, you will follow me all the way to your cross.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.860]   And then he added, "By this death, you will glorify God."
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.720]   Now this must have been incredibly sobering for Peter.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.140]   So, Jesus, I have proven myself
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.800]   that I am genuinely repentant,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.620]   and you have accepted me.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.060]   You say that my love for you is real and deep,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.980]   and what I get is the promise of an excruciating death,
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.820]   all to the glory of God?
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.200]   And I ask, me, John Piper, ask,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.820]   what if Jesus had said, "When you were young, Peter,
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.340]   you walked about with a pain-free life,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.100]   but now that you have proven your love for me
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.500]   and that your repentance is real,
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.680]   and you are ready to serve me,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.400]   now you're gonna spend the last 20 years of your life
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.060]   in unremitting pain, to the glory of God."
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.160]   That is, in fact, what Jesus says to many Christians.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.000]   Think of it, Christians all over the world,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.940]   authentic Christians, real Christians, loving Christians,
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.440]   penitent Christians, millions of them,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.340]   suffering every imaginable kind of sorrow and loss
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.260]   and oppression and persecution and pain and disease.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.540]   Remember how Paul said,
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.060]   "What can separate us from the love of Christ?"
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.620]   And then he listed all the threats to our faith,
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.980]   tribulation, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.300]   and he could have added, or long drawn out, pain.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.940]   And if Peter's final torture by crucifixion
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.260]   could be described by Jesus in advance
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.500]   as for the glory of God,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.780]   then all of our suffering can and should be endured
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.320]   for the glory of God.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.860]   And so we ask, how can that be?
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.640]   And the Bible gives many pointers,
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.940]   but I'll just mention two.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.040]   And believe me, I know that mentioning them
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.740]   is a thousand times easier
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.000]   than living them through suffering,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.340]   but I'm called to say what the Bible says.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.520]   And so here it is.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   Number one, first, when we suffer without cursing God,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.260]   without forsaking Christ,
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.460]   declaring ourselves to be his friend and servant
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.820]   and disciple and follower and a great lover
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.140]   of his glory and faithfulness,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.060]   we make plain to others that having Christ
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.180]   is more precious to us than having freedom from pain.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.180]   The pain, in fact, becomes a suffering with Christ
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.020]   because we are walking with him,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.740]   we are holding fast to him in the midst of our suffering
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.500]   rather than throwing him away because of our pain.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   In this way, the trustworthiness and the value
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.420]   and the goodness and the wisdom and the power of Christ
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.420]   is affirmed and made clear simply by our faithful endurance
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.100]   in reliance upon his inscrutable grace.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.100]   This is the way Paul fought his own battle.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.400]   He said in Philippians 1,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   "My aim is that Christ will be magnified in my body by death,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.940]   for to me to die is gain."
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.460]   In other words, not throwing away Christ
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.620]   in the sorrows and pain of dying,
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.620]   even long-drawn-out dying,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.620]   magnifies Christ as greater gain than life.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.340]   And the second way our suffering can glorify God
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.140]   is when we endure it by trusting the promise
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.140]   of 2 Corinthians 4:17, which is even more amazing
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.400]   than the one we've already seen from Philippians 1:20
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.820]   about honoring God in our death by counting death gain.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.460]   Paul looked at his whole life of suffering
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.820]   and it was remarkable.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.820]   Just read 2 Corinthians 11, 1 Corinthians 4.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.220]   He said, "This light momentary affliction
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.140]   is preparing for us, that is producing for us
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.020]   an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison."
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.620]   In other words, when we can see no benefit
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.960]   coming from our suffering on earth,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.780]   the Bible directs our attention away from earth
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.620]   and says, "These many years of suffering
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.620]   are not meaningless, they are not pointless,
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.620]   they are not in vain, they are actually producing."
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.540]   That's the actual meaning of the Greek word preparing.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.260]   They are producing, they are bringing about,
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.140]   they are producing a greater and greater weight of glory.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.980]   That's more than saying to die is gain.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.860]   That's saying the long drawn out pain of dying
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.980]   is producing greater gain.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.940]   With every bolt of pain, we can say,
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.860]   if we have the consciousness to do it,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.980]   "God will make it up to us, he will make it up to me,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.060]   it will not be wasted in heaven,
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.460]   we will look back on all those years
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.700]   of seemingly meaningless sorrows and pains
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.700]   and say, it was worth it, he has made it worth it."
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.940]   So I pray for the dear mother of our anonymous friend,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:33.940]   Father, would you give her relief?
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:40.180]   Yes, would you give her relief in the name of Jesus?
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.900]   And until then, keep her faith from wavering
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.700]   because the steadfast love of the Lord is better than life.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.540]   - Thank you, Pastor John, it's very sobering.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.420]   Thank you for listening today.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.020]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.420]   you can search through or browse all 1,600
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.820]   of our past episodes, or you can subscribe to the podcast,
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.820]   you can do all that online at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.580]   On Monday, we take on another sobering email.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.820]   It's a question from a young man who grew up
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.340]   in an abusive and dysfunctional family.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.620]   How will this affect his relationship with God
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.780]   and what hope does he have for future healing
