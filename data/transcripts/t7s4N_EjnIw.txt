[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   Ryan writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, is a tight budget a sufficient reason in and
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.160]   of itself to delay a young dating couple from getting married and prolonging their engagement
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.340]   for a significant amount of time?
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.120]   This question assumes all of the factors are a go.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.640]   Both love Christ, the local church approves of the match, parents approve of the relationship,
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.360]   and emotional and sexual purity has been honored."
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.760]   Pastor John, what would you say to this couple?
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:42.960]   Well, in general, I would say I'm in favor of trusting God for His willingness and ability
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.640]   to help a young couple make it in such circumstances.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.280]   In other words, I'm probably going to lean toward, "Go ahead, take the risk, get married."
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.360]   But here's some questions I would ask.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.280]   Does the guy have the ability to support himself and his wife?
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.320]   Now, I think he should want to do that, and he should try to do that.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.880]   I think part is calling his head and provider and his male masculine role.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.800]   But there may be good reasons why he can't.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.900]   For example, there may be a disability.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.880]   He might be a veteran, say, who was wounded, comes home, and the job he used to do, made
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.960]   a good living, can't do it anymore, and he's got to find another way.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.760]   Now that may be temporary, and a young wife might step up and bring them through a season
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.920]   with her own employment, or it may be permanent.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.360]   And she marries him knowing, for whatever reason, good reason, he will not be able to
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.280]   do all that he would love to do in supporting the family.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.160]   And she will honor his manhood in other ways, and he will take his unique responsibility
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.960]   as head in other ways, and she will probably make more money than he does in that kind
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.240]   of situation, and they will partner to make this marriage work.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   And we should—it would be good to remind ourselves that in former centuries, especially
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.680]   in agrarian societies, most societies, it was built into the roles of marriage that
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.200]   it was a kind of shared, productive business partnership.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.220]   The farm worked because he and she and the children and the hired hands did their chores.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.440]   If anybody shirked, the business failed.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   Everybody worked.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   It wasn't like she was just watching soaps.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.200]   I know that's anachronistic, but she was fully engaged in the domestic dimension of this
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.620]   business called the farm, and it was necessary that she be a part of that.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.920]   The woman should ask, I think, the young woman in this scenario we're talking about, "Does
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.060]   my fiancé have character traits that are holding him back from finding the kind of
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.040]   employment that can support us?"
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.100]   Like is he lazy?
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.960]   Is he fearful?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.920]   Is he distracted?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.400]   Is he totally into sports and not yet grown up?
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.540]   Is he irresponsible with money?
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.880]   What is it that has us stuck at this place?
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:42.640]   And if she finds that this is in fact the reason they wouldn't be able to make it financially,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.140]   then if I were her, I'd pull back from the relationship and let him know that she needs
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.120]   to see significant maturity before she could move forward with marriage.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.220]   Now, see, that's a different kind of failure than a disability or some other reason that
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.420]   might be hindering it.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.480]   She should be aware that there are often character traits that keep a man from stepping up and
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.240]   making a life for him and his wife.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.980]   And the last thing I would say is where I started.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.500]   If there is maturity, if there is deep love, if there is a community and family support,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   I'd probably say go for it.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.580]   Two can live more cheaply together than apart, and marriage at its best is to help us through
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.220]   tough times, not just be rejected because there are tough times.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.780]   And so, boy, I remember how it was with me and Noelle, and I was ready to marry far quicker
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.620]   than we did get married.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.060]   And if I had to do over except for Noelle's dad, who wanted her to finish college before
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.260]   we married, I would have married her a year earlier, and we would have made it.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.680]   We were both in college, but we would have figured it out.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.500]   So I'm inclined to say there are downsides to being deeply in love, being ready to marry
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.460]   in every way but that financial one.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.780]   There are downsides not to moving forward.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.260]   And a huge sexual temptation is one of them, as well as living a life of great frustration.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.260]   I think God calls couples to really enjoy fighting this fight together if they're mature.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
