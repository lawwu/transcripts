[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Oftentimes, we think that travel is something that we buy rather than give to ourselves.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   If we can figure out how to travel within that local economy, how to travel in a way similar to
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.680]   how people in the country were visiting travel, then I'm sure that's how you were able to get
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.400]   seven and a half months for $7,500. It's not by the big flashy stuff that you see advertised in
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.400]   glossy magazines or even on Instagram feeds. It's the quieter, humbler, more interactive places
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.200]   where the people in West Africa or the people in Southeast Asia or wherever, South America,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.320]   travel, and it pays off in time. That chicken bus probably goes slower and has less air
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.400]   conditioning than the nice tourist bus, but it puts you into a culture in a way that the tourist
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.600]   bus doesn't and it costs a lot less. It goes a lot slower and it pays off in that time wealth
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.400]   that we're talking about. Yeah, I could talk about time wealth all day. It's really worth thinking
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.000]   about in the context of we have a limited wealth of time in life and we should really take advantage
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.520]   of it and not put off our best self to another time of life. We should grab this time and let
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.240]   it enrich our lives. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.720]   your life, money, and travel. If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.760]   who loves doing all the research to get the best experience in life without an expensive price tag.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.600]   Today, I couldn't be more excited because I'm talking to someone who's had a huge impact on
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640]   my travel life, Rolf Poth. If you're not familiar with him, you should be. He's an award-winning
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.040]   travel writer who's been published in almost every publication, but I came to know him from
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.560]   the book he wrote almost 20 years ago, Vagabonding, an Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.920]   Travel, which became a classic of travel writing. It has been an international bestseller. In fact,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.080]   I stumbled upon the book in 2009, and it played a huge role in Amy and I taking a trip for eight
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.720]   months to backpack around the world. It was also part of the inspiration for my friend Tim Ferriss'
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   book, The Four-Hour Workweek. Needless to say, it's a must-read for travelers, and maybe even
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.960]   more importantly, people who don't necessarily travel but want to. Just this month, he followed
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.200]   it up with a new book called The Vagabond's Way, 366 Meditations on Wanderlust, Discovery, and the
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.800]   Art of Travel. It is filled with stories of travel and journaling, quotes for each day of the leap
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.640]   year, important note, from centuries of philosophers, authors, poets, and travelers, all paired with
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   reflections about the wonder and importance of travel. I found it to be fabulous, especially for
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.480]   someone like me who struggles, find the time to sit down and read a few hundred pages at once.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.160]   In this conversation, I want to talk about time wealth, why that's such a vital topic in life,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.360]   how it transforms travels, and what anyone can take from the concept to travel in a richer way.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.320]   How we can adapt to the changes of travel technology and still have amazing adventures.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.760]   Why he once traveled for six weeks without luggage, and what you can learn from that
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.400]   experiment. How leaving your phone behind or getting lost might create richer experiences.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.080]   Why he thinks that as you get older, you can still have more richer and fulfilling travels and so
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   much more. Welcome to the show. Thanks for being here. Good to talk to you, Chris. I'm happy to
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.200]   talk about this. Yeah. I have a lot of questions. Big fan of yours. It's the book I've gifted more
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.040]   in my life than any other book, which someone always asks you, "What's your favorite book?"
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.960]   I was like, "I don't know, but 'Vagabonding' is the book I've purchased more to give to others."
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   We can make this a conversation because I've tried to live a lot of the spirit of what you've
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.800]   written. I will kick us off and ask, what do you think one of the biggest misconceptions
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.320]   the average person has about travel as you believe it is and you embody it?
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.120]   Well, that it's expensive, for one thing. I think that for generations, this is something I talk
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.520]   about in the new book, "The Vagabond's Ways," for generations, it's been seen as this indulgence.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.480]   It's been seen as this thing that wealthy people do to showcase their lives. When in fact, I think
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.600]   people of all backgrounds have always been able to travel if they've made it a priority. I think
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.920]   expense is a big one. Of course, hacking is something that you focus on. We can talk about
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.480]   different hacks. You talked about time wealth. That was the huge hack for me from the beginning,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   realizing that time is more important than wealth in a certain sense, that creating time
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.120]   is really what you need to do to create a dream experience like travel.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.480]   There are other things too. There are fears. There's this notion that the world is more
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   dangerous than it is, partly because it used to be that the old headline, man bites dog
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.800]   media environment. Well, now it's clickbait, that bad news clicks better than good news.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.280]   Fear is another thing. Then I guess just difficult, but I think it's easier and easier these days,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.440]   especially in the world where so much information is available, whereas sometimes there's too much
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.000]   information, but there's enough information doing at least to encourage us that there are people
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.720]   who are not that different from us traveling in a very rich and slow and long-term way.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.240]   It sounds like it's been something you've been thinking about for a long time because 2008,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.480]   2009, that's pretty early in the life cycle of my first book, Vagabonding.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.400]   My wife and I, we had to do jobs and I got laid off and I was trying to find some freelance work.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.280]   She didn't love her job. We were like, "Let's take a trip." I didn't have work. She quit her job.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.040]   We're like, "Let's take a trip before we find new jobs." We started putting pins up on a map
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.400]   of where in the world we wanted to go. We didn't really know that traveling for more than a vacation
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.200]   was a thing. We'd never been told that. We'd never heard of the gap year. I read your book and I was
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.360]   like, "Oh my gosh, why a month? Why a week? Why not just go and see what happens?" We ended up
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.480]   buying, or I guess technically in our case, using points to get a one-way ticket to South Africa.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   We had a rough idea of where we were going to go, but we certainly didn't have anything more
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.360]   than a couple of nights booked and we just went. It lasted about seven and a half months.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.120]   It ended up costing about $7,500, which I think adjusted for inflation. Who knows what that is
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.640]   today? But I think it's a whole lot less than most people spend on an eight-month trip if they take
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.080]   it. I think the slow travel, which I want to get into, is probably the thing that made that
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.760]   possible, not trying to rush from place to place. Then obviously, staying with locals helped also.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.840]   Yeah, that's awesome. It's funny. Seven and a half months is exactly how long my first
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.960]   vagabonding trip was. In 1994, it cost me $5,000, although this was back when gas was as low as 79
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.560]   cents a gallon in the United States. Of course, this is before #vanlife. I was just living in a
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.000]   van. I was just dirtbagging it. But that's really cool to hear. It's also cool to hear that you'll
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.760]   lost your job or you had a disruption in your life, and so you responded by doing something
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.440]   you dream about. I think sometimes people, they put off their dream life to some undefined time
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.760]   in the future. Often, retirement in the United States is a huge one because really nobody is
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   saying that you can travel more than a vacation. Until you're retired and you have more time for
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.000]   that, well, you can create time. You can look for time wealth. That's really cool that you responded
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.640]   to a disruption in your professional life by just sort of creating a little, what Tim Ferriss would
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.400]   call a mini retirement, but just an opportunity to embrace the world and live those travel dreams
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.840]   now because you can. Even if you can't live them this second, you can start saving money and make
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.720]   them happen much sooner than American society tells you you can take that dream trip.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   I think that the cost to fly internationally and the cost of expensive lodging that you can confirm
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.600]   right away and you don't have to walk around a town to find is such a huge piece of the expense
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.480]   that if you say, "Okay, well, we're going to go and stay," and you're willing to stay and you're
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.160]   willing to find local accommodations, everything gets a lot cheaper. Then my hack for your fear
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.600]   thing was that I always told people, they were like, "Oh, is this country safe? I've heard it's
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   dangerous." I always pointed to this one. I don't know if it's still in there, but there was a
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.280]   lonely planet for New York City a long time ago, probably at least 15 years ago. If you looked at
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   it under the safety section, it said, "Well, if you're going to New York City, you should carry
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.720]   a money belt and you should make sure you put all of your money and your passport and your money
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.080]   belt and tuck it in your pants in the front." I remember money belts were like a travel thing for
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.320]   safety and I would show this to people. I literally ripped the page out and I would show people and
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.600]   they'd be like, "Well, I've been to New York. You don't need a money belt. I don't carry a money
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.400]   belt in New York." I'm like, "Exactly." If they're telling you New York isn't safe and you know it
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.600]   is, do you really need to believe that everywhere else in the world isn't safe? That was my mindset
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.120]   shift that I gave people was everyone's going to say everything's dangerous because it's clickbait.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.880]   If you can get over that, the whole world can be a lot more opening to you.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.960]   I think that there is, to be somewhat facetious about it, a money belt industrial complex.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.840]   There's a lot of things that people would sell you to assuage this fear when, in fact,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.480]   you just put a couple of bucks in your sock or just put it in your pocket and odds are
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.080]   New York is full of New Yorkers who don't typically get pickpocketed. A lot of times,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.240]   the pickpocket economy focuses on the most obvious touristic part of a place, that most parts of any
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.920]   city in the world are going to be places where pickpockets aren't going to hang out because
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.800]   there's not that many tourists to pick their pockets. Sure, I'm sure that there's a few
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.880]   picked pockets a day in Times Square, for example, but New Yorkers don't go there.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.160]   That area is interesting for a while, but then there's more interesting parts of the city after
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.880]   you're done. Yeah, no, I agree with you that I think sometimes just showing up and figuring
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.920]   things out can do you a lot. I think sometimes we feel like we're hacking something like hotel
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.440]   expenses. You get online, you do some comparison shopping, you find an "bargain" and then you get
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.560]   to the city and you go straight to the hotel, not realizing there might be entire blocks of hotels
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.040]   where people in Thailand stay that cost a fraction of the big international hotels that you're
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.480]   shopping for online, for example. Again, one hack might be simply the willingness to not plan too
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.560]   much in advance because, as I say in the new book, you get smarter every day of your trip.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.800]   Whatever deals you found while you're sitting in your home office, and sometimes there's
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.200]   fantastic ones, and I'm not going to fault the cool deals that the travel industry has,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:20.640]   but sometimes you're not going to know that this cool mom and pop beach hut in Indonesia
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.600]   that isn't online, but is in the lexicon of every traveler who's been through that part
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.160]   of Sumatra, that that is going to cost you $12 instead of the $50 that seemed like a bargain
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.600]   before. I think that confidence and savvy that comes with just each day of being on the road
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.280]   of a long trip really is one of the best hacks out there. I got a call this week from a reporter at
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.520]   the Washington Post who asked my opinion on this TikTok video that she was writing a piece on.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.160]   It's like, "Oh, this is 2022 at its finest." There's a woman saying, "Before you book your
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.640]   flight, before you book your hotel, what you should really do is create a Google map and put
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.760]   a pin on every single thing you want to do and see and eat and drink. That way, you know exactly
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.400]   where to book your hotel, and you can plan it all out in advance." A quote of mine that ended up in
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.960]   the article was that, "I really worry in today's day and age that we're creating a checklist before
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.640]   we even leave, and we've got a map, and we plot everything out." It's like, "What kind of
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   experience are you going to have?" I'm not opposed to trying to flag some things you want to see,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.520]   but I would encourage people to leave most of your time unplanned. Have the list, maybe. Maybe
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.200]   you could write a list of what you want to do, but don't commit to, "I'm doing this this day,"
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.600]   and set yourself in stone that that's the plan. I'm sure, as you've seen, most of the most
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.440]   memorable experiences I've had traveling are not the experience that I put on the list before I
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.920]   went. It's a random person you met at a bar that I invited you to come have dinner with his family.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.640]   And then the list goes on, a random place you just wandered down a street.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.280]   Yeah, I don't take fault with that list, be it with pins on a Google map or just on a piece
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.520]   of paper you keep in your pocket, but I think you really have to inbake a willingness to throw it
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   away if you find something more inspiring. Because in a way, there's almost like a speed dating
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.360]   analogy here, that we're going to go on all these set dates with all of these people or places with
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.680]   certain categories that we've defined in advance when maybe you'll fall in love with the person
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.280]   you meet in the lobby. What happens if you've overplanned everything and you don't leave
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.000]   yourself open to the spontaneous and literally or metaphorically falling in love, if not with
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.160]   a person in a place and staying longer than you had planned on staying? And I think that's a big
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.800]   problem that people have. I understand why you have a giant checklist of things you want to do
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.400]   in a place, but sometimes you're racing around so much trying to get to the checklist that you don't
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.640]   give yourself time to slow, to relax and look and just savor a place. I think savoring is something
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.840]   we don't yet have an app for, right? That being able to just be happy that you're on the other
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.520]   side of the world, you're sitting on this beach and looking at the Indian Ocean and just being
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.680]   grateful for this moment and not worrying about what you're going to be doing tomorrow, that's a
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:05.280]   great gift of travel. And I think allowing yourself to set the itinerary aside when you really respond
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.520]   to something on the road, that's a great non-planned plan to have, just the willingness
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.560]   to improvise as you become inspired and more knowledgeable. Yeah, I've heard you tell a story
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.440]   that I'm going to hope you repeat, which is about someone you were speaking with, I think, that was
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.920]   frustrated that they didn't get a chance to go do everything they wanted to see in Paris because
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.560]   they were stuck at a cafe and all they wanted to do was experience Paris and they felt shackled to
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.720]   the cafe. Yeah, well, actually, that's more than one person. Initially, that was me. The first few
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.280]   times I went to Paris, I was just so frustrated that the restaurants are slow. America was very
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.600]   efficient. They can churn people through restaurants. They find your table, they bring
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.720]   your bill. In Paris, it was just so comparatively slow. And then in time, I realized that that was
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.400]   just part of the pleasure of being there. And so I had students and friends who would come and visit
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.880]   me in Paris. I teach a writing class there every summer. And I realized that for all the people who
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.960]   are sitting worrying about their bucket list of things to do in Paris while they're waiting for
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.240]   their creme brulee to come, they're looking for an experience of Paris that is abstracted from
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.960]   the actual experience of Paris. Parisians don't have a checklist of things. They actually enjoy
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:22.240]   the three-hour lunch. They enjoy being able to just savor each aspect of the meal and talk to
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.760]   the waiter not as just sort of another pawn in their game who's looking for a tip, but a guy
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.440]   who really knows the food and that's conversing with this person will help them have a better
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:36.560]   meal. And the tables outside in French restaurants face out into the street so that you're sitting
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.440]   next to your companion side by side, sort of interacting with the street and observing it.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.240]   And so I think if you don't allow yourself to just enjoy that three-hour lunch, even though it's way
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.360]   less efficient than an American lunch, you're not allowing yourself to enjoy Paris. In America,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.800]   and I'm guilty of this, sometimes we eat lunch standing up so we can get on with our day.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.600]   But actually the experience of Paris is being able to savor a lunch in the way that French people do.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.120]   And if you don't allow yourself that experience, you're sort of cheating yourself out of a core
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.440]   experience of being in a place like France. I want to jump back. We skipped through a bunch
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.800]   of things. You talked about time well. So can we talk a little bit more about, you said it was this
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.000]   major unlock for you. How can people take that concept and improve their mindset and improve
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.800]   their travel? Well, I think it's a core shift in what you consider wealth is. I think it's a matter
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.520]   of letting what wealth you have serve you instead of shifting your existence to serve a certain idea
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:40.240]   of wealth. I think oftentimes we go through all this trouble to reach certain goals, not realizing
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.560]   why we want them. And I think wealth is a big one, that there's certain metrics we use to judge
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.600]   wealth. And one is money, one is possessions. But I think the truest expression of wealth is being
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   able to use this limited amount of time you have in your finite life. We're all born equally rich
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:01.360]   in time when you think about it. And finding ways to let that time enrich your life in a way that
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.120]   makes your dreams come true. I mean, I talk about travel all the time. So often I talk about time
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.680]   wealth in the context of travel. It could be about spending more time with your kids, for example.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.760]   I meet travelers who go to the other side of the world and realize that very poor countries,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.480]   comparatively poor countries like Uganda or Cambodia, being a father in those places is much
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.160]   more interactive with their kids. They don't compartmentalize their fatherhood in those
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:28.560]   parts of the world like they do back home. So they learn almost by accident this idea of wealth as a
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.680]   manifestation of how you spend your time. And one interesting person I talked to is Kevin Kelly. I'm
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   sure you're familiar with his work, a co-founder of Wired. He talks about how young people are
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.240]   richer in time than money and older people are richer in money than time. And I think one reason
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.560]   why young people are stereotypically more given to long-term travel is that they're in that
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.600]   situation. They don't have more money than older people. They have less responsibilities. They have
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.200]   more of a willingness to forego certain comforts to get more time out of what money they do have
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.320]   in their wallet. And so it really comes down to spending what money you do have in such a way that
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.200]   it makes your life more fulfilling. And I think oftentimes we think that travel is something that
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.840]   we buy rather than give to ourselves. And if we can figure out how to travel within that
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.800]   local economy, how to travel in a way similar to how people in the country were visiting travel,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.960]   then I'm sure that's how you were able to get seven and a half months for seven and a half
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.720]   thousand dollars. It's not by the big flashy stuff that you see advertised in glossy magazines or
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   even on Instagram feeds. It's the quieter, humbler, more interactive places where the people in West
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:41.360]   Africa or the people in Southeast Asia or wherever, South America, travel and it pays off in
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.880]   time. That chicken bus probably goes slower and has less air conditioning than the nice tourist
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.600]   bus, but it puts you into a culture in a way that the tourist bus doesn't and it costs a lot less.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.840]   It goes a lot slower and it pays off in that time wealth that we're talking about. Yeah,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.440]   I could talk about time wealth all day. It's really worth thinking about in the context of
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.080]   we have a limited wealth of time in life and we should really take advantage of it and not put
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.760]   off our best self to another time of life. We should grab this time and let it enrich our lives.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:18.480]   One fun anecdote, which is my wife worked early at Lyft and the origin story of the company was
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.640]   before it was Lyft, it was a company called Zimride. And before it was Zimride, the name
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.960]   hadn't existed and one of the co-founders was in Africa riding one of those slow buses.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.240]   And that was the inspiration for starting Zimride, which became Lyft. So you say,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   the luxury bus might've been more fancy. But in this particular random case, taking that one bus
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.480]   ended up building a multi-billion dollar company. So there is one anecdote of even that cheaper,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:56.160]   slower, maybe sweatier bus can pay off for some people. I generally think travel is an opportunity
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.200]   to see people doing different things, different ways around the world. And that makes you a more
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.240]   creative person, makes you a more curious person and leads to all kinds of things.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.760]   So funny that you use the one example that I happen to know ended up becoming a wild success.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:18.480]   But I think it's a fun story. I also think I had a conversation with my wife the other day,
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.400]   and we were talking about goals. And we haven't really gone through this process
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.720]   of what are our goals for our family, for our finances, for our health. But we thought,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.400]   "We have two daughters now, maybe we should." And my wife had this financial goal. I want a
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.720]   net worth financial goal. And I pushed back to her and this connects back to time wealth.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.680]   But she said, "I would love to hit this milestone." And I said, "Okay, well, we could hit it. But
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.400]   would you be okay if that meant either one of us was working a lot more and not spending as
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.040]   much time together?" And she's like, "Well, no, I wouldn't want that." And I was like, "Well,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.280]   would you be okay if we moved to a different part of the country that was cheaper,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.560]   or we cut back on some of the things we do?" And she's like, "Well, no, I wouldn't want to
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.640]   sacrifice those things." And we had this conversation where in our minds, and this is
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.080]   purely part of the society we live in and the expectations we set on people,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.880]   she had felt like we needed to grow our net worth. And in a way, through this conversation about what
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.840]   we actually wanted to spend our time doing, we left being like, "Actually, maybe we need a smaller
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.680]   net. Maybe we need less." Bill Perkins wrote this book, Die With Zero. And the premise is like,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.600]   "Why are we trying to amass all this money? We should be trying to take the money we have and
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:38.000]   optimally use it to have the most fulfilling life." And in some cases, that might be actually
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.880]   not trying to grow and grow and grow your wealth, but maybe to find more creative ways to spend it
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.560]   or unlock time. Yeah. No, I love this example. Actually, I love the shared taxi from Africa
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.520]   example too. But I think wealth is an abstraction. It's often future-oriented. And one thing,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.840]   using children as a great example, because oftentimes we think of children in terms of
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.640]   them being potential adults, when in fact, the blessing of having them as children is having
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.520]   them right where they are, right? And so, sure, it's good to create security and create good
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:16.080]   habits for your children. But part of the pleasure of being a parent is like having them being a
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.200]   newborn that is gripping their finger with their whole fist, right? And just being able to enjoy
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.520]   that moment regardless of what your net worth is in 20 years. I think one danger of having
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.400]   arbitrary goals for net worth is that you become focused on those goals rather than that very
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.720]   transient experience that is parenthood, that each phase of your kid's life, it can be exhausting,
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:46.080]   of course. But it's so special. It's just so exciting. And then I think there's a different
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.560]   dynamic. I remember sort of when I shifted from being this kid that was being raised by my parents
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.880]   to this traveler who was sort of hosting his parents and sort of being the expert and that
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.040]   they were the young, curious, naive people, even though they were my parents in a place like China
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:06.000]   or the Czech Republic. And so, I think, yeah, nothing against having goals or thinking about
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.840]   net worth or creating safety nets or steering children in such a way that they will become
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.880]   productive adults. But just that blessing, I think often that cliche is, "Enjoy them while
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.400]   they're toddlers, that'll be gone. Enjoy them while they're infants. Enjoy them while they're
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.480]   in grade school because you'll miss that." Well, you really do need to embrace that. And that
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.880]   sometimes if we're making decisions that are based on 20-year goals rather than just looking at our
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.280]   kids or looking at our life or looking at our travel, looking where we are, then we are relegating
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.600]   our lives to an abstract future instead of embracing the beauty of the moment.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.960]   You mentioned moving to another place. I'm based in Kansas, which is a much less fashionable place
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.480]   than the Bay Area where you're based. But one nice thing about that is that it just pays off.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.880]   I'm not a parent, actually. I'm an uncle. I love being an uncle. But it just costs less to get
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.400]   through the day, to achieve certain goals in life. And that pays off in free time. And so,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.760]   I'm not saying that everybody needs to move to Kansas or to a cheap part of the world like
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.960]   Columbia. There's a lot of places where digital nomads go because they can save money. But there
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.240]   are different tools, hacks, if you will, to take what money you do have, to take what income and
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.840]   interests that you have and loves, be it from family or activities, and find a way to make
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.600]   them a more active part of your life. I've talked about it on my own podcast that people will often,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.920]   they love the mountains, but Oregon is hard to afford these days. So, they move to Tennessee,
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.760]   and they can hike three times a week in Tennessee for a quarter of the price of Oregon.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:46.320]   So, I think that there's a lot of ways that if you can embrace the concept of time wealth and
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.160]   realize that there's different ways of freeing time up in your life, then you can really focus
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.920]   your life on those present moment goals that make life richer and more enjoyable and more fun and
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.000]   more rewarding and more likely to give back to things like family and community.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.160]   Is there a process or a framework that someone listening to this is thinking, "Gosh, I really
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.960]   wish I could figure out what that means for me"? Are there questions you would propose someone
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.080]   think about to kind of figure out what they want? I would say that there are some questions like,
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.560]   "What makes me happy in the course of a given day and in the course of a given week? Where is my
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:27.600]   happy time?" And if I'm so stressed out, it's watching cat videos on social media, then maybe
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.080]   you should get a cat. I think sometimes we assuage our stresses through distractions rather than
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.720]   passions and loves. I think sometimes we don't know our passions, and I have nothing against
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.840]   college. My father taught college, my sister teaches college, and I think it's a very noble
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.080]   vocation. But sometimes we go to college without even knowing what we like to do. And other
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.080]   cultures have gap years. In the UK and Australia, they have places, the gap year where you take a
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.040]   year off after secondary schooling, but before university where you travel or you work.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.280]   And that allows you to find out what you really love to do and where your passions are before
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.160]   you spend all this money going to university. And so weirdly enough, I think that travel
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.400]   and maybe traveling for seven and a half months or whatever is a great way to find out what you
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.360]   love. I think there's what your parents think you should do, there's what your counselors think you
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.320]   should do. I think oftentimes young people, but even older people, it's the same way, that until
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:30.240]   you are off into the place completely away from the pressures and routines and constrictions of
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.320]   living at home, you can really find out where your heart lies. That you might sit in a village
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.520]   for a day and watch people build a house and think, "Gosh, I want to build my own house,"
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.240]   or study architecture or something like that. That's just a random example.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.600]   One thing I talk about in the new book in the context of a couple monks from hundreds of years
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.560]   ago, the young monk talks to the older monk. The older monk asks him a question about life and he
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.240]   says, "I don't know." And the older monk says, "Very good. Not knowing is most intimate." I
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.280]   think it's good to embrace not knowing yet, not just how to live our lives, but what our goals
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.720]   are of just sort of being the person who's traveling through the world without not a lot of
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:17.360]   plans yet, but having the faith to think, "Eventually, I'm going to really wander my
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.840]   way into something that makes my heart sing, that makes me fall in love with some aspect of life,"
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.320]   and that's going to be focused on it. That could be any number of things, including family.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:36.080]   For years, I lived next door to my parents. My parents are now in assisted living. They're not
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:42.000]   far from me now. The whole lesson of living next door to one's parents, which is not a very common
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.920]   American thing, is very common in almost every other part of the world, in Southeast Asia and
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.360]   Africa, pooling your resources and getting land. That paid off not just in the fact that I was able
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.440]   to save money, but I was able to spend some quality time with my parents at a really cool
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.920]   time in life. I think there's a lot of different strategies into creating either on purpose or by
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.240]   accident. This whole familial thing was an accident. It was an idea about how to live as a
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.520]   family that I didn't get until I was overseas, but there's ways to allow yourself to grow into ways
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.800]   of being that you might not seem now. You just need to allow yourself to sit still for a while
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.680]   and stop distracting yourself and start embracing things in life.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:26.080]   It seems like spending a lot of time with family, you picked up quite easily because it's so common
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.560]   in the rest of the world. Are there other major things that have affected the way you live your
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.760]   life now that are themes that travel has brought you, aside from just traveling?
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:43.920]   Right. Travel is so much a part of things. If we can see this, travel is more than a consumer act
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:52.000]   that are certain commonalities that we see again and again. Family is one of them. I've often said
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.320]   that when I was traveling through Southeast Asia, I was 27 years old, people would say, "Oh, are you
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   married? Do you have kids?" I said, "No, no, I don't." They're like, "Oh, I'm sorry." It was such
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.480]   a core value in this part of the world. I got the sense from them that their happiness was so tied
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.000]   into family, into marriage and children and relationships with family, that it seemed weird
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.680]   that I, this very rich and comparatively rich and mobile guy, would not have that as a core value.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.320]   I think food, another one, to be very simple, like in France, that's not the only place where
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.840]   meals are much slower and more communal than we have in our standing up, posting to Instagram
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:33.680]   while we're sipping our latte, first world society. I think it's really these basic
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:41.600]   building block things that travel has taught me to come home to. Another great thing about France,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.280]   but it's also something that you'll see in Africa or Asia, is eating food that was obviously grown
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   within 20 miles of where you're eating it, of biting into a cherry in France and feeling cheated
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.360]   because you didn't realize cherries could taste that good. It's not some magical French thing,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.280]   it's just that French place value on seasonal fruit, produce. They're not flying in cherries
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.720]   from Chile in the middle of the winter. There's a certain time in late June, early July when it's
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:16.560]   cherry season and that's when you eat your cherries. Weirdly enough, obviously, travel has
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.360]   given me philosophical perspective with things like time wealth, but it's often these basic
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:27.280]   building block themes, love for family, concern about food that I bring home and try to bake into
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.280]   my travel life. And then also just not rushing and multitasking things, being able to slow down
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.040]   and let a day happen instead of micromanaging and trying to rush through it to be somehow
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.040]   ahead of your competitive neighbor at the end of the day. I think that not to fetishize other
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.760]   cultures, because I'm a big fan of American culture, but I think sometimes we are doing
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.080]   too much, we're throwing too much at life and not sitting still. It's just another great lesson I've
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.360]   had from travel is the ability to sit still and let a day happen in a way that really enriches it.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.680]   And that can happen in a comparatively wealthy country like Norway, where I went for the first
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.640]   time this summer, or a comparatively poor country like Indonesia, where I went a few years ago.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.000]   It's really fun to intertwine one's home life with lessons learned from travel. And I'm sure you
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.600]   discovered a lot of things on your own journey and the journeys you've had since.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:26.080]   Yeah, I mean, so many. I'd love to talk a little bit about how you have the kinds of experiences
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.360]   in a new place. Obviously, we mentioned, look, if you land in Paris and you go straight to a hotel,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.560]   and from your hotel to the Louvre, and then from there to a reservation, you're going to kind of
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.160]   miss it. But are there things that you try to do and how you structure your time in a place,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.680]   how long you're there, what you do first that kind of allow you to immerse yourself in a new place?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.600]   Well, one of the catchphrases from Vagabonding that I refreshed in the new book, The Vagabond's
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.760]   Way is, "Walk until your day becomes interesting." And I think we often don't give ourselves credit
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.520]   for just showing up in a place and walking around without really knowing where we're going or having
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.520]   any goals or checklists and just sort of walking until you sort of get a sense for the pace of a
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:11.440]   place. And instead of sightseeing, maybe smellseeing, follow the smells around a neighborhood
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:21.760]   and just find ways to slow down and realize that quotidian things are as amazing as sightseeing
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.720]   places. To use Paris as an example, they have a convenience store. It's an equivalent of 7-Eleven,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.040]   it's called the Carrefour. There's also a Monoprix. And just realizing that it's a little
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.480]   bit different than the American equivalent. Another thing I write about in the new book
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   is getting a haircut in Egypt on Zamalek Island in Cairo, which took an hour and had 23 steps and
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:46.640]   cost $6, including tip. One, it was the best haircut of my life, but it was just a haircut.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:54.480]   It also gave me perspective on the meticulousness of Arab masculinity as pertains to appearance.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.360]   And so, I had this wonderful experience just by willing myself to get a haircut in a foreign place.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.280]   So, I have nothing against sightseeing. I have nothing against tourist districts. I think it's
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.720]   pretty normal to go to places you've dreamed about. If you're in Egypt, sure, go to the
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.440]   pyramids. It'd be silly not to go to the pyramids, but get a haircut. Go to the local market, go to
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.200]   a sweet shop. A great thing about Egypt specifically is that they take their sweets very seriously.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:23.280]   And just like way more than your average hostess ding dong, they have these handmade sweets that
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:30.720]   are amazing and dirt cheap and really fun to see. And so, I'm sure I'm curious, what strategies...
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   You had a seven and a half months around the world. Did you have any go-to strategies when
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.360]   you landed in a place after you were a little bit salty as a traveler?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:43.200]   We tried to always, no matter what the purpose of the trip was, we try to always
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.400]   walk towards the food market or the market. It doesn't have to be a food market. It could be,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.280]   you know, in Turkey, there are more markets. In a lot of Arab cultures, it's just like everything's
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.440]   going on in the market. There's food stands, there's shopping. In some places, it's really
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:04.160]   more of a food market and you go early. I think in Indonesia, the food market's closed by 10,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.200]   11 in the morning because everyone's there right in the morning to get food.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:13.280]   And that's a place where I think definitely you could smell sea and all the senses are kind of
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.440]   a part of a food market. But it's also true in the fish market in Tokyo, it's like just people
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.480]   running around, bumping around, what's going on. I feel like that is my favorite place to kind of
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.720]   get my bearings of a city. It's like, what are people eating? What are they drinking? Are they
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.520]   negotiating? Are they a yelling culture? Are they a friendly culture? You could see it all in this
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   one place. And you could eat. You could do it on your own. Recently, I kind of love just going on
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.920]   a tour somewhere with some local of a food market and getting a lay of like, what do we eat in this
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:51.840]   culture? How do people shop? How do people buy? I don't know how you feel about hiring tour guides
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:58.000]   versus just walking solo. I think there's room for both for me. But that's where I start almost
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.160]   everything. I mean, we went on our honeymoon to the Seychelles, but we still went to the food
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.600]   market. The market, I think it was a fish market downtown because we were like, we just want to
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.080]   feel a place. Even if the goal is to relax, we still want to feel the culture here.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.680]   Yeah, I love that. And I think sometimes travelers will go to a market and they'll
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.600]   walk through the whole thing, but they'll only go to the jewelry stand or the brass figurine stand
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.800]   or whatever, the obviously souvenir thing. But I love the idea of getting ingredients for a meal,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.520]   even if this vegetable, you don't even know what it is yet. It helps to have a place with a kitchen,
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.640]   of course. But there's just so many times where tourists will spend like an hour in one of the
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.400]   most famous markets in the world and then they'll go to a restaurant. It's like, no, no, buy food,
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:48.880]   just get a picnic, get those figs and that tea or whatever and have an adventure of it.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:53.120]   And you mentioned a guide sometimes, like early in the travels, like in your first days in a place,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.240]   I don't often get guides, but I'm not opposed to it because sometimes the guides can help you
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   negotiate things and they can explain like, oh yeah, no, actually this isn't a fruit, it's a
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.640]   spice and we use it in this soup for this reason. And it gives you a headstart. It's worth the
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.360]   monetary investment because it gives you a headstart on understanding how life works there.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.600]   And I love market cultures. I also love market squares too, because oftentimes there's like a
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:25.200]   soccer game or people are playing foosball or basically it immediately insinuates yourself
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.680]   into the daily life of a place. Because again, Parisians aren't usually standing in line for
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.520]   the mosque. Egyptians aren't usually taking a tour bus to the great pyramids, they're doing
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:39.680]   different things. And both Cairo and Paris, two of my favorite places in the world, really reward
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.760]   that walk through the market. And like in Paris, for example, different markets will be open on
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:50.880]   different days. In Cairo, the best oranges I've ever had, I've gotten in a market in Cairo for
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.320]   pennies. Who would have guessed, but I was just wandering around and it's like, yeah, I'll get
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.240]   this orange that's half the size of my head, why not? And it was delicious. And I think those are
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:05.440]   the surprises that you can't really, there's no app for that. There's no micromanaged way to wander
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.480]   into those awesome market moments where suddenly you're eating this fruit that you didn't realize
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.560]   existed. And now you're on your fifth one, because it's amazing and you're in Indonesia and it's a
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.040]   lot of fun. So yeah, I'm with you. That was jackfruit for me. I had never heard of jackfruit
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.760]   my whole life. I tried it now. I love it. My daughter is two and she's obsessed with jackfruit.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   So I'm finding myself trying to find the Asian grocery store to go buy more jackfruit. And I
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.240]   didn't even know it was a thing. I just saw it and I was like, "What is this?" They're like,
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.800]   "It's kind of like a banana, maybe a pineapple, a little bit mixed." And it's my favorite.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.120]   Well, that's something you can take home too. You were talking before just like,
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.400]   what attitudes do I take home? Well, sometimes the simplest one is food. For my birthday last
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.720]   year, my wife took me to a Korean restaurant way out in probably an hour from here. Well,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   I was so excited because every time I eat Korean food, it reminds me of being back in Korea. In a
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.800]   way, I can always take a little bit of my heart back to Korea when I'm eating kimchi and bulgogi.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.920]   And so that's a big part of it. It's like suddenly these places are in conversation
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.960]   with each other. I'm curious, do you have any rituals that are sort of born of travel? Do you
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:14.720]   have any things at home that were sort of baked in by your journeys in other places?
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.520]   Gosh, I'm trying to think through. I mean, I know when it comes to food,
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:26.000]   I'd say 50% of the foods that we cook are not traditional American food. We cook a lot
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.560]   of Korean food because we just love Korean food. And so when we go to places, the gifts I try to
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:38.160]   bring people, I'm like, "Oh, let's bring some smoked paprika from Croatia." I can't remember
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.760]   what country, Budapest, Hungary. Hungary, I think has a lot. I could be totally wrong here,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.040]   but I think it was Hungary has a lot of paprika. So I brought home everyone paprika and I want to,
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:53.840]   I try to... The things we bring people are things to help them experience something
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:01.280]   kind of satiating, like a drink, an alcohol, a spirit, a spice. I don't know. That's one.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.760]   I remember, I can't remember where I was that I experienced raclette and we bought a raclette
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.680]   grill. My wife has since, it's been this sore subject in our house, which is like,
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.200]   "We never use this thing." And I'm like, "No, but one day we will." And she's like,
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.320]   "We've got to get rid of it. It hasn't been touched in two years. It's caked on with dust."
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.040]   But I think food is something that when we're in another country, it's like,
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:30.400]   "I only want to eat local." In India, it was like, "I will risk sickness to be able to eat the food
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:37.120]   on the street, drink the chai tea from the cups from a person." That's travel a lot for me is
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.800]   kind of understanding that. And ideally, talking to people about it. I think the experiences that
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:50.000]   have happened once we've come home are always being able to connect the dots in strange ways.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.680]   So a great example was we were in the park, just a five-minute walk from our house the other day,
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.160]   and all these people are dancing. And I was like, "Why is everybody dancing?" This is not a park
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.560]   where there's normally dancing, but there's a bunch of kids and adults all dancing and eating.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.240]   And I asked them, I said, "What's going on?" And they're like, "Oh, we're celebrating because it
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.800]   was the Lebanese festival last weekend, and all these kids danced in a parade. And so now we're
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.840]   kind of celebrating here." And my daughter runs up to the middle of the group. A woman picks her
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:24.560]   up. And it's funny because I think many Americans would be terrified if a random person in a park
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.800]   starts picking up and dancing with your kid. But we're like, "Oh, I've been to Lebanon." And the
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.440]   culture is just so welcoming. We ended up spending two hours there having meals, talking about our
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:40.560]   trip to Lebanon, and having a way to connect with people. And I think it turns out we live half a
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.680]   mile from a Lebanese church. And they're like, "Come on every second and fourth Sunday is when
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.200]   we have all the families there, and we do all these events and gatherings. We don't care if
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:55.360]   you practice whatever religion, just come. We love meeting people who understand and are excited to
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:02.080]   learn more about our culture." And so I think one cool thing to take away, and depending where in
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.640]   the country you are, it could be harder or easier, but you don't have to go halfway around the world
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.480]   to have a really immersive cultural experience that's far different from where you are.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.560]   And so I think we try to have those experiences when we're traveling, but we also try to have
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:22.240]   those experiences here and find the pockets of a city that are lots of Korean restaurants or
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:28.160]   lots of people doing XYZ and try to do that while we're here. Because for us, we can't always be
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.360]   traveling. And with two small kids, it's hard. But it's not hard to necessarily go to a local
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.040]   Korean restaurant or meet a bunch of Lebanese people dancing in the park.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.160]   That's awesome. And that's great that you had a kid that was just completely fearless and just
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   ran in and sort of insinuated in that situation. Kids are actually a great travel tool. I have a
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.240]   lot of old traveler friends who, they get married and they start to have kids and they're worried
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.280]   that it's going to cut into their travel experience. You know what I can, because
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.520]   kids need a certain structure and discipline on the road. But I've found that people around the
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.080]   world love kids and they don't really need a common language to pick up a kid and admire
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.880]   how cute it is. And so, kids can really be a window into a place. And when they get to a
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.840]   certain age, not only are they fearless, but they have no preconceptions about what is or isn't
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.000]   important. I have a chapter in The Vagabond's Way about I went with my nephew to Père Lachaise
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.440]   Cemetery in France, and he was 14. And usually, you go there and it's like, "Oh, here's Jim
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.280]   Morrison's grave," or "Here's Oscar Wilde's grave," or "Here's Abelard and Eloise." Well,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.800]   he was 14. He didn't know who any of these people were. Jim Morrison died the year I was born. So,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.520]   he barely knew who the doors were. But he just was curious about everything. He's like, "Well,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.800]   why are there all these flowers on this grave? His name is Frank Alamo." It's like, "Well,
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.000]   I don't know." And he's like, "You don't know who Frank Alamo is?" It's like, "I've been here for
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.400]   10 times, but I don't know." So, we looked it up and Frank Alamo is like this sort of Elvis-style
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.520]   pop star who just died in France. And there's this other grave in the cemetery that had all these
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.880]   hammers and weasels carved into this giant grave. And it was this Russian princess whose fortune
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:02.400]   was made on iron and fur, hence the hammers and the weasels. And it's just sort of this strange
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.120]   mystery that basically all he brought to this place was his imagination because he was a 14-year-old
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.600]   kid. And suddenly, I was learning things in a cemetery that I had been to several times.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.640]   And so, I think kids can be a great travel tool because not only are they just excited that people
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.800]   are dancing, but also they humanize you to other people. It's one thing to be a couple of outsiders
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.360]   in a group, but outsiders with kids who are excited about things, then suddenly, you're one
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.880]   of them in a certain way. A family is a very recognizable unit around the world. And it's a
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.400]   great window into places. I know you don't have children, but you've got your nephew. I'm sure
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.200]   you've had more travel conversations than probably anyone listening. Are there tips that you've
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.320]   picked up from others that you'd give to people with kids trying to think, "Gosh, travel can be
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.360]   stressful with children. It seems like too much. How to make it easier? How to make it feel more
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.400]   approachable?" Well, again, structure is something that they need more than your average dirtbag
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.920]   traveler. They need a sense for how each day works. But maybe also take them into environments
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.600]   that do capture their imagination, maybe environments where there are other kids.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:14.800]   We default to museums and cathedrals way of travel, which is fine and interesting,
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.520]   but it's more abstracted. It's more tied into things like history or religion or wherever.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   We're sometimes just a random park. Now, I feel like if somebody is in the Bay Area,
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   they should go to this park where you found that dance. Basically, any park where people are having
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.840]   fun is a window into a place. And kids, at the end of the day, love to run around. And there's
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:37.120]   so many places, preferably away from heavy traffic, where kids can run around and suddenly,
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.240]   you're hanging out and your kids are opening doors into a place that you wouldn't have noticed
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.160]   before because kids don't need to have a common language to run around and have fun.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.840]   And sometimes they'll talk to each other and have perfect conversations without realizing
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.160]   they don't really speak the same language at a certain age. And so, I think just sort of that
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.880]   openness and realizing that it's a lot simpler than you think. I think we can sometimes
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.680]   micromanage parenthood in the United States. We have our special backpack full of the sippy cup
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.360]   and then the iPad and all these things that we feel like we need to keep a kid occupied,
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.720]   when in fact, a green space where they can run around with other kids is great.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:20.880]   Actually, that market, I'm sure kids would be really excited visually and centrally by a market
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:26.560]   just because it's like, to use a metaphor that would make sense when I was a kid, it's like
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.280]   something from Star Wars. It's like the cantina scene from Star Wars where the music is different
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.680]   and the food is different. And in this kid-like way, it's like you're on another planet. And so,
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.560]   I think allowing your kids to engage their imaginations in a way that we as parents and
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:47.920]   elders sometimes have ceased to do is a great way to make them great travel allies and to sort of
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.160]   follow their example of being kid-like in a place that we don't understand but we can be engaged by.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.720]   I want to talk a little bit about slow travel, but I think that is also a big
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   thing. I haven't done this yet. Our kids are two and four months, but we thought about travel.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.920]   It's like, what if instead of trying to take a week trip to Italy, we take a month trip,
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.160]   we find some Airbnb, we could rent our place out here while we're gone so that the cost of the
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.880]   trip is a little cheaper. Or maybe, I haven't thought about this way, we find a family and
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.800]   stay with them or something and get to know people. But when you're there and you create
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.480]   a routine, you can create the routine there. There's not as much pressure of, "Oh, well,
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.760]   we have to do all this stuff because we're only here for four days." It's like, "Well, today,
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.440]   we're going to go to the park. Maybe we're going to sit at a cafe. We'll come home,
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:38.400]   you can take a nap." We don't have to get it all done. I think I'm really excited to do a little
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:44.800]   bit more of that style travel, which we did on our big trip, because we didn't have the money.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.080]   We were just like, "We're going to stay in the city for a week because we can't afford to keep
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:55.600]   moving." But I think that could be something valuable to do with kids instead of the traditional
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.760]   late 20s trip where you're just like, "Go, go, go through everything."
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   I think that's great. Experience more by doing less. In fact, you live in a very popular part
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.120]   of the United States. There's actually home exchanges. You can find somebody in Italy who
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.520]   wants to live in the Bay Area for a while. There are online sites where you can do home exchanges.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.760]   I live in Kansas.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.320]   Have you heard of people that have had success? I want to do a little bit of research here,
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   but it's like, what are the odds that there's a person in Italy who wants to come to the Bay Area
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:31.680]   the same week I want to go to Italy? Have you heard good success stories from people doing this?
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.920]   Absolutely. Some of the students in my Paris class from the Bay Area have done home swaps.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.040]   They basically find a place to stay during my class in Paris while the French family
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:46.720]   is enjoying a California vacation of their own. There's no silver bullet. It's not a perfect
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.600]   thing, but it's very doable, especially if you live in a part of the United States where people
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.680]   from other countries would like to live in themselves. And then the great thing about
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.320]   being with a family in a place is that doing chores, washing dishes, you're basically routine,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:06.160]   you're suddenly doing it in a more Italian way. And I guarantee when you walk down the same street
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.120]   for the third day in a row with your super cute kids, the guy that owns the pastry shop is going
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.680]   to come out with a little snack for your kids. Basically, you become a part of the habit of that
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.360]   neighborhood. I think sometimes tourists, even backpackers are ghosts. They're there for a couple
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.600]   of days and they're gone. And so, you can't really develop relationships. Whereas in for a month,
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.400]   it can be really special if there's this American family that's suddenly in the village and they
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   don't speak the language that well. And they're sort of cute when they order the food because
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:42.000]   they get the words wrong and they order a dessert food item for dinner or whatever.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.800]   But then suddenly, you have this new enlivened empathy simply because you have joined,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.600]   instead of being part of a touristic routine in a place, you've joined the daily routine of the
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.520]   people who live there. And then suddenly, you and your family or you and your partner or you as a
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:05.920]   person alone are experiencing a place in a very rich way that is not taking five countries off
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.600]   your list, but it's taking one community for example, a month. And you're really going deep
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:17.040]   in a way that you're probably more likely to think about it in your old age, that one month in the
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.120]   beautiful Italian village, than if you'd been racing to five different countries in that one
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.160]   month during the same time. So, I'm a big fan of slow travel. It's funny because you talked earlier
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.760]   about getting your hair cut. And I think back to our trip around the world and some of the most
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:36.080]   memorable moments. And mine too was getting my hair cut in Nairobi by someone who was terrified
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.840]   because they're like, "I've never cut a white person's hair in my whole life." And I was like,
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:46.400]   "Look, I promise you, you can't mess this up. I don't care." And we had this amazing... It wasn't
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.360]   quite as long as your experience. But it was so much fun. And we had a great conversation. And
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:57.680]   I remember that infinitely more than probably... I can't even tell you the restaurant that maybe
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.520]   someone recommended I go to or was the highest rated and we went to. I don't know what it was.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:08.000]   I don't remember a dinner out in Nairobi, but I do remember that haircut. And so, I think
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.520]   that's interesting. You mentioned checking items off a list. I'm curious how you feel about people
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.640]   creating bucket lists or kind of... Is that something that you're like anti-bucket list?
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.160]   Do you like it? How do you feel about the concept? Well, I have a whole mini chapter about bucket
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.440]   lists. I'm not anti-bucket list, but you really have to understand that the bucket list is what
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.320]   gets you out the door. Because so many items on the bucket list, the pyramids being a great example,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.440]   well, there's a lot of tourist buses there. There's a lot of Egyptians there who are part
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   of the tourist industry and they want you to pay $100 to sit on a camel, which is fine.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:46.160]   But I think five hours spent in a neighborhood market in Cairo is going to be more rewardingly
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.000]   Egyptian than you would have five hours waiting in line and going around and getting your pictures
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.840]   for Instagram at the pyramids. I'm not going to say don't go to the pyramids, but I'm just going
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:01.200]   to say that the things that you find by accident on the way to the various items on your bucket
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.920]   list are probably going to be the things that make you happiest. You're talking, not to make
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.560]   this all about haircuts, but I was driving in New Orleans with my friend Dan once and he just said,
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.840]   "I'm sick of my hair. I need a haircut." So, we just pulled off the road. We just happened to be
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.360]   in Canton, Mississippi. We pulled into a place, it was a black neighborhood and we go into a
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.440]   barbershop and the guy's like, "I've never cut white hair, but I got this." This is the United
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.880]   States. We sort of made the day of everybody in this black barbershop. It was sort of this
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:33.120]   collective effort, like let's cut Dan's hair. He doesn't have the naturally kinky black hair that
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.880]   the people in this neighborhood have, but let's figure this out because in Canton, Mississippi,
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.520]   white people never come into this barbershop. It was this funny thing. It wasn't the best haircut
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.400]   that my friend Dan ever got, but we sort of made their day because in a town where there's still
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.200]   elements of segregation and white people just don't swagger into the barbershop in the black
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.760]   part of town. Suddenly, we had this experience that whatever lack of proficiency that in the
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.600]   haircut was, it was super memorable and super fun where suddenly we were just sort of casually
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.200]   hanging out in a black barbershop in Canton, Mississippi because we needed a haircut and
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.080]   it was as memorable as anything we found on the way to New Orleans. We had a blast in New Orleans.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:18.480]   I'm not going to knock that, but part of what was fun were the things that happened away from
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.120]   Bourbon Street or the other things that you're supposed to see in New Orleans or on the way to
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.680]   New Orleans itself, stopping in this town that we didn't really know much about before we randomly
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.960]   walked into a barbershop to get a haircut. I think being willing, even as you seek out items
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:39.040]   on your bucket list, to surprise yourself and to foolishly wander into a barbershop that isn't
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:43.520]   necessarily used to cutting your kind of hair, that can be super memorable. It was obviously
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:48.160]   memorable for you in Kenya and it was memorable for us in Mississippi. I think this juxtaposes
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:53.680]   something really fascinating, which is I think, "Oh, I had this experience. I had to go halfway
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.520]   around the world to get my hair cut by someone who'd never cut a white person's hair, and here
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.960]   you do it straight in the United States." I think so much of travel, and I'm guilty of this myself,
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.760]   it's like in order to have these crazy experiences or unique experiences or different experiences,
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:12.880]   you have to go halfway around the world. Can you help me get over that? This was one example,
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.440]   but how do you feel about the fact that I feel like there's all this pressure to have
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.800]   to travel, you need to hop on a plane and cross an ocean?
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.480]   Yeah, well, a couple of things came to mind. One is that whole concept of walk until your day
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.120]   becomes interesting. Just going for walks, counterintuitive walks in your own neighborhood
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:34.560]   or in one neighborhood over, and just even walking to work or driving to work in a way that you're
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.600]   not used to doing, just finding different patterns in your home environment on foot can be really
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.160]   interesting. One thing I talk about in The Vagabond's Way is how about during the pandemic,
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:49.120]   my wife and I were itchy to travel, but we really couldn't. We couldn't go see your cousins in
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.600]   Norway, so we decided to walk to a town in Kansas called Little Sweden. It was 22 miles from our
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.240]   front door to Little Sweden. It took us seven hours. Our feet hurt really bad, but it was so
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.720]   fun to see this little landscape of the Kansas countryside on foot through a method that we had
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:10.080]   never seen before, so that was really fun. Even simpler than walking 22 miles to Little Sweden
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.360]   is these food experiences. I think one fun thing about the barbershop experience in Mississippi is
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:21.040]   that we had broken an unwritten rule, which is white people don't get their hair cut in black
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:28.400]   neighborhoods. Well, oftentimes, we go to places that are "dangerous" in our own hometown, but even
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:32.800]   places where poorer people live, they have to eat lunch. What's it like to go to a cafeteria counter
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.040]   in a neighborhood we don't usually go to? I think sometimes we realize that there's a wealth of
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:46.320]   cultural options in our own town, just because we're in the habit of our own social class or our
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:53.440]   own bubble of familiarity in our home, and that sometimes a neighborhood that's seen as a barrio
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.680]   neighborhood probably has the best Mexican and Latin American food in your own community.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:04.960]   It might just be a storefront that's next to a television repair shop, but odds are
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.520]   that food is really great. The price of doing it is just being willing to go to that part of town
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.080]   where maybe not as many people speak English as they do in your own neighborhood, and going to
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.880]   a place where people who might have a generation ahead of them still living in Mexico, and suddenly
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:24.000]   you're eating food in a context. Actually, speaking of Mexico specifically,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.840]   my sister who teaches college in the little Sweden town here in Kansas, she realized that
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.560]   most of the Mexican people who worked at local restaurants and stuff didn't just come from
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:39.680]   Mexico, but they came from Zacatecas. They came from a place called Fresnillo. She realized that
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:45.760]   there were buses that go from central Kansas to Zacatecas. For 10 or 20 bucks, you can go to Mexico
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:53.120]   on the same buses that migrant workers go to see their family. Just by pushing the envelope,
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.960]   not just going to the Mexican restaurant, by saying, "Where exactly in Mexico are you?
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.720]   How often do you see your family?" Really, there's a shuttle service that goes to Wichita that takes
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.080]   you to a bigger bus that goes to Dallas. It takes you to an even bigger bus that takes you to the
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.320]   border. Then you take Mexican buses home. She actually was able to create an adventure to
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:13.120]   Mexico with her family that cost nothing. They were able to, instead of hanging out with tourists
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:18.480]   going to Mexico to Cancun, nothing against Cancun, but basically they took a bus full of people who
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.680]   work in the service economy of central Kansas, and they were able to get to see a part of Mexico
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.440]   that they never would have otherwise seen because they were willing to see a part of Kansas that
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:32.160]   they had never otherwise seen. I think food in immigrant communities is a huge
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:39.120]   window. Even if you don't end up on a minibus to Mexico, being willing to just unfold the layers
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.480]   in immigrant communities in your own hometown is a great way to experience travel while you're
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:47.520]   still home. There are a few things we haven't touched on that I'd love to talk about briefly.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:52.000]   I know you took this trip about, I don't know, a decade ago, where you just literally had no
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:59.440]   bags. First off, that's wild. We did no checked bags, which I think is doable. TBD on how doable
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:04.800]   it is to small kids. What did you learn from going on a trip with no bags, and what does
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:10.960]   that change now? What do you not take on trips now? One thing I learned almost immediately that
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:16.560]   this big central core conflict in telling a story about traveling the world with no luggage
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:23.360]   became pretty easy pretty fast. I was traveling with a sponsor. I had a vest full of things where
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:28.480]   I could put things in my pockets. I got used to that system very early, and people would often
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.320]   say, "Well, gosh, I wouldn't want to sit next to you on an airplane. You must smell bad." It's like,
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:37.840]   "No, I actually showered every day, and I washed my clothes every day." Basically, at the end of
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.200]   the day, I would take off the clothes I was wearing, shower with them, dry them up for the
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:46.480]   next day, and I would just rotate two sets of clothes. I was actually very clean. Once I got
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:52.800]   used to it, it was pretty simple to do. Early on, my sponsors are saying, "Should we contact the
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.520]   Guinness Book of World Records? I don't think this has ever been done." It's like, "Have you
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.160]   heard of refugees? Have you heard of merchants that have been traveling the world forever?"
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:06.080]   The idea that you have to travel the world with a bunch of giant bags is pretty new in a certain
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:13.360]   sense. Yeah, I guess the first lesson I learned is that once I got into my meticulous cleanliness
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:19.120]   routines, I didn't really miss my bags that much. Now, this has not made me a full-time,
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.560]   no-baggage traveler, but what it did make me realize is that it's not that hard to take a small
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.440]   day pack or like 30-liter or less backpack with you that you can put in the overhead bin,
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:36.640]   because at the end of the day, really, what I was most relieved not to have were the giant bags that
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:41.440]   I had to check under the plane or drag around over the cobblestones or to grunt through the
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.960]   tropical country with sweat dripping down my brow. I realized that my kit, whether it be in pockets
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:53.280]   or in a relatively small bag, you don't really need that much to have a great time when you
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:58.720]   travel. In a sense, our best travel memories aren't about the crap that we put in our backpack.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.640]   It's about this awesome thing that we found in the village square. It's about these people we met,
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.320]   or it's this experience we had, or at the very least, it's about something that we got and we
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.160]   put in our backpack and brought home from the other side of the world to commemorate this
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:16.400]   memory of a great experience we had before. It was such an instructive trip. To this day,
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.520]   I haven't really done anything that compares to going literally with no baggage for six weeks
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.480]   around the world. It was a blast to do, but it's really leavened me. Three years ago,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.280]   I traveled around the world for three months with one 30-liter bag, and it was easy. In fact,
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:36.400]   I still felt like sometimes I was overpacked. At the end of the day, it just didn't take that much
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:41.280]   for me to have a great time and have everything I needed. One final thought about that, it's even
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.040]   easier these days with so much on your smartphone to help guide your trip from GPS maps to language
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.800]   translators. There's fewer things that you do have to pack in your bags. Of course, this brings up
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:59.840]   the can of worms of your phone can actually distract from your travel experience too.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:04.560]   But no, there's really no longer any reason to take a bunch of stuff around the world. Just
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.600]   discipline yourself into taking the bare minimum and letting the world provide the rest,
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   including experiences. Are there any items that you're like, "This one particular brand of shoes
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.720]   or sweater is the thing that I always bring now." Is there anything for you that's your go-to travel
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:26.960]   item? I think besides my Kindle, and I don't want to sing the praises of Kindle too much because I'm
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.040]   a big fan of independent bookstores, and my new book is out in hardcover. It's my fifth book,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.080]   but it's the first time I have a book in hardcover. But the Kindle allows me to take my
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.320]   library with me. I love it. There's certain clothing items. I'm a fan of merino wool,
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.160]   for example. I'm a fan of my 30-liter pack. I'm a fan of Blundstone boots. They're not a sponsor.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.600]   Actually, my merino wool and my pack are sponsors because
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:54.560]   Vagabonding is such an old book. People have actually started travel product companies
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.920]   and said, "Look, Vagabonding inspired this." So it's like, "Oh, y'all wear it. This is pretty
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.840]   good." Blundstone boots out of Australia is not one of those companies. I think they've
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.160]   been making them since the 19th century. I love Blundstones. They don't have laces. You can slip
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.600]   them on and slip them off. They're very sturdy. They look as good in a nightclub as they do on a
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:18.080]   mountain trail. So I'm a big fan of that, but it's not that many things. My Kindle, my boots,
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:24.960]   a few toiletries, my merino wool, and I'm a pretty minimalist traveler, and I'm happy traveling that
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:31.200]   way. Well, you brought up the phone, so I feel like it'd be a good place to go. I thought about
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.480]   the first international trip I took that I remember. I took some as a young kid, but the first
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:43.200]   one that I was on my own without my parents. I went to Taiwan when I was the first freshman or
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.160]   sophomore in college because I'd gone to boarding school. My roommate in high school was in Taiwan.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.920]   I was like, "I want to go visit him." I was like, "Gosh, we didn't have iPhones." So I was thinking
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.000]   about this trip and all the things we did. I was like, "Well, I guess we just relied on locals and
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.400]   instincts and it didn't matter." Now I think about trips and the way technology has changed,
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   both for the better and the worse, the experience of being somewhere. I know you've challenged
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.360]   people to leave their phones behind at different parts of trips. How do you think technology has
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.960]   changed things, and how can we still have the kinds of experiences that we all want to have
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.000]   and not get distracted? Well, I remember that first wave of technology that really allowed us
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.560]   to travel in a different way. In fact, my example is my first vagabond trip was 1994. I was living
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.440]   in a van, and I would call my parents once a week with my calling card. This is before I used email.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.880]   Five years later, I was living in Asia, and it felt like a luxury to be able to email my family.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.880]   I was in closer touch with my family from Mongolia than I was from Oklahoma,
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.000]   right? Just five years earlier. Around that same time, that was 1999, I remember there were some
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.480]   articles, I think in the San Francisco Chronicle, about how virtual reality will allow you to travel
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.640]   the world without leaving your home, right? Well, now that we have the smartphone, now that we have
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.520]   this little black mirror in our pockets, we can be traveling the world without really leaving home
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.080]   in the habit sense. We're still sending text messages to our friends. We're still looking at
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.000]   our social media feeds. We're still reading. Instead of picking up the local newspaper,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.440]   we're reading an online newspaper or an online social media feed that we still do back home.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.880]   In a sense, smartphones have made travel easier. They've made it harder to get lost and harder to
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.000]   get bored, but they've also sort of trapped us into those same insipid habits that we have back
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.960]   home. I've literally met travelers who, even on the other side of the world, the last thing they
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.480]   do before they fall asleep is look at their phone. The first thing they look at when they wake up is
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.520]   look at their phone. It's like, "Guys, you paid all this money to go to the other side of the
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.680]   world. Do you really need to put a phone between yourself and what you're experiencing?" That's
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:51.360]   why I'm a big fan of encouraging people to use their five senses, to not just look and listen,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.440]   but to smell and taste and feel their way around the world. Really, you don't have to travel without
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.400]   a phone at all, but maybe leave it in the room for a day. My wife and I did this in Paris and
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.600]   Norway this summer. We found all the cool places we wanted to see on our computers and phone when
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:13.760]   we were still in our lodging, but we would mark it on a paper map and use that paper map to explore
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.800]   the city. That allowed us to not fall back on our phone every time we thought we were lost,
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.040]   not to fall back on our phone every time we wanted to send that cool picture of the cool
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:30.000]   dog to our mom back home. Basically, it just forced us to be unconnected for a while.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.360]   We could have those experiences. Sometimes, there's this little pencil for a restaurant
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.920]   that we wanted to see in the 20th arrondissement, but suddenly we found a place in the 11th arrondissement
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.840]   that was cooler and completely caught us by surprise. This cool fromagerie was next door,
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:53.280]   and we got some cheese for the next day. I think allowing yourself to have experiences by chance,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.480]   to use the information that is available through our phone, but not to drown ourself in all these
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.520]   options so that we're always questioning the moment we're in. I think, again, going back to
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.120]   the idea of living so much of our lives in the future, even as we plan and try to be responsible
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.400]   individuals, we cheat ourselves so much out of what is in the present. It's actually an old
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.720]   phrase now, FOMO, fear of missing out. Sometimes, if we have our phone, we could be having this
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.120]   amazing experience in an amazing city, but our phone is telling us that, "Oh, maybe there's a
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.840]   better market that's five minutes this way," or, "Maybe there's a better restaurant that's 10
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.560]   minutes this way." Actually, no, it's amazing you found this place by accident. Embrace that while
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.240]   you have it. Give yourself permission to trust your instincts, to trust your nose and your palate
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.920]   as much as that smartphone app, because those are the things that you're going to remember,
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.720]   that you're really allowing yourself to travel as a pilgrim instead of as a consumer,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.200]   and to wander yourself into a deeper understanding of what that travel experience can be.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.360]   A couple of things I want to hit before we wrap. I found that one of the greatest ways that I
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.960]   lighten the cost of my travels is to play the travel hacking points and miles game. I know
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.920]   you're not as deep in that world as me, but I'm curious if there are any cost-saving travel
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.760]   hacks that you like that we can share with people listening.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.720]   My old one was just fly into a place and then take it from there, that regardless of the
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.080]   multi-itinerary you could do, there might be a train that crosses an international border,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.280]   there might be buses, there might be shared taxis that could inspire the next Lyft or Uber
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.960]   in some part of the world that you didn't even know existed, but suddenly it's a really cool
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.680]   way to travel and the people are just delighted that this awkward, sweaty American is in this
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.880]   shared taxi in Laos or Senegal or some other part of the world.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:45.680]   So I'm a big fan of overland travel and flying into a place and winging it from there. Oftentimes
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.400]   too, you go into the neighborhood in Bangkok or the neighborhood in Nairobi where local people
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.640]   find their plane tickets, and oftentimes those onward flights are cheaper than if they had been
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.280]   done internationally through a middleman. What I've done as I've gotten older, I'm not the best
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.040]   flight travel hacker in the world. I can probably learn from you and other people who've done that
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.680]   quite well with credit cards and miles and things like that. In part, I got so insinuated in the
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:16.080]   overland travel into the point-to-point sort of bucket shop travel, bucket shops are places where
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.120]   in immigrant communities or in local communities where you buy discounted tickets, but I've often
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:26.240]   found that more recently I've taken a lot of trips through flight aggregators like Airtrex,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.640]   airtrex.com, that allows you to plan multi-stop itineraries under one umbrella that you can fly
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:40.320]   around. I think they do itineraries up to 25 stops, but I usually do it usually four to eight
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.680]   stops. I've done it around the world, but this summer, for example, I went from Denver to London
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:52.000]   to Paris to Norway to Faroe Islands, back to London and Denver. Just under one umbrella, I was
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.640]   able to have them put together the best flights possible. There's two ways you can do it with
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.520]   Airtrex. One is that they have an online widget that you can go in and one fun thing is you can
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.880]   waste half a day just doing a sample trip that you don't actually plan on taking, but just seeing
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:14.800]   how much would it cost for me to fly from New York to Brazil to West Africa to Italy and take
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.400]   a train to Moscow and then take another train to the Pacific and then fly to Bangkok. You can waste
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.520]   a day just doing trips that are absurd and just to see if it works. They also have a number that
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.240]   you can call and talk to a person. I usually use them in tandem and the person will help you put
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   together this trip and they might give you some advice like saying, "Well, actually the cheapest
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.680]   way to fly from Los Angeles to Australia is through Singapore and maybe you can just stay for a week
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.800]   in Singapore on this cheap trip and get another experience out of that trip." What I do with
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.560]   Airtrex is usually I'll tinker around with their online widget and then when I think I know where
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.920]   to go, I'll call the representative. It's like a travel coach and they help you design that flight.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:02.080]   I'm not saying it's always the best way to hack flights, but my gosh, if you have an extended
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:07.040]   multi-stopper around the world flight, it's a great way to go because it saves money and then
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.000]   you basically have everything is under one bucket and you basically have an advisor that can give
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.360]   you that great advice saying that, "Yeah, you'll save $200 going through Bangkok and actually
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:23.520]   Bangkok's pretty cool. Why don't you stay there two weeks and save another $100?" It's not technically
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.200]   a hack, but it's a great service, Airtrex.com. Cool. And then the last other question I always
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.400]   like to ask everyone, is there a city in the world you know well enough to leave anyone listening who
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.360]   might be heading there with a few unusual or fun recommendations for whether it's a meal,
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:45.200]   a drink or some unusual activity or experience? Wow, let me think. Immediately it came to my
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.240]   Paris. I'm not even that much of an expert on Paris. I've been there many, many, many summers
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   in a row to teach English. And so, my French isn't even that good. I'm there teaching classes
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.640]   in English. And the Parisian, this is sort of cheating on the answer, but it's a good answer.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.920]   It's an old French technique of the flaneur. Do you know what a flaneur is? A flaneur is,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.000]   this is Baudelaire sort of invented the idea in the 19th century. It's a person who walks
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.960]   through the city, not in search of things, but just in search of experiences. They don't see
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:19.040]   the city as this utilitarian route between point A and point B. It's a person that realizes that
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.680]   wandering from point A to point B is full of experiences that you don't know about yet.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.040]   And so, you can use it as, it's technically a male verb, but you can be a flaneuse or you can
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.880]   be a female flaneur. But it's a noun, but it can also be a verb. I'm going to flaneur my way through
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.840]   this experience. It's very baked into the Parisian way of seeing the world. You can practice it in
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.000]   any city in the world. And you probably don't want to go through a dangerous neighborhood drunk at
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.640]   night, but being a flaneur who just sort of wanders through a city, not quite knowing where you're
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.200]   going to go, but knowing that something awesome is going to happen. Again, based on something you
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.960]   smell, something you see, or somebody you bump into, that is a great strategy for seeing a place.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:04.000]   And I'll have an aside story. I talk about it in the Vagabond's way that I used Trip Advisor to
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   find Trip Advisor's best rated rendang restaurant in the Indonesian city of Bukit Tinggi. I went
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.320]   there and it was fine. But what I realized, I'd gone through a market, again, going back to markets,
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.640]   through of people who lived in Bukit Tinggi, eating dinner, and they weren't going to this
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.560]   place. They didn't use Trip Advisor. They lived in Bukit Tinggi. They're eating in the market.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.080]   And so, I realized that I had used this, instead of just flaneuring my way through the market and
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.320]   seeing what was delicious, I'd use Trip Advisor to go to a place that was outside of the market.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.200]   So, that has only reinforced the idea that wandering through a place, just sort of being
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.920]   hyper aware, not to your phone, but to the environment in the manner of a flaneur who's
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   just seeking experience and is seeking surprise, that's probably better than any single recommendation
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.240]   I could give you in Paris. And if I do, my wife is the foodie. She could give you
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   restaurant recommendations, but she's out of town today. So, be a flaneur.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.080]   That's okay. I'll take it. That's a fair answer. And the book, the book's out. You can get it
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.240]   where books are sold. I picked up a copy at a local bookstore. So, thank you for writing it.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.200]   It was fantastic. Where could people stay on top of everything you're doing, all your writing,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.600]   and everything you're up to? I'm an old school website guy. I've had it for almost 25 years,
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.560]   RolfPotts.com. It connects to all my socials, which I use from time to time, but really,
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.680]   it's a good starting point for all the books I've written, for all my podcasts,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.480]   my Deviate with Rolf Potts podcast, with articles I've written back into my dirtbag days in the
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.560]   1990s. For all things Rolf Potts, it's a good place to start. Awesome. Well, Rolf, thank you
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.840]   so much for being here. Yeah. It's good talking to you, Chris, and it's fun to hear your stories.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840]   Good luck with your next adventure with your kids.
