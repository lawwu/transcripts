[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   All right, so I thought, Jesse, we should do a habit tune up segment.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.720]   We've been doing these off and on.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.040]   I think people have been enjoying them.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.560]   These are segments where I just take a piece of advice or a strategy from my productivity
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.160]   canon, things I've written about in my books or in my newsletter over the years, and just
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.160]   get into it a little bit, tune up or refresh people's understanding of that habit.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.120]   So in today's habit tune up, I want to talk about the corner marking method for taking
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.280]   book notes.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.320]   So the general topic here is taking notes on the books you read.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.440]   Now, before we get into the specifics of what I do, we've got to make it clear that there
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.940]   are two general schools of thought among those who think about reading, two different schools
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.820]   of thought about the role note taking should play when you are reading books.
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.240]   Now these are my names, but I think most people would agree with these general categories.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.160]   The first is what I call the Zettelkasten school of thought.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.960]   So inspired by the Zettelkasten note taking system, this school of thought says you should
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.420]   always take notes on books you read, regardless of why you're reading them or what you're
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.420]   reading them for.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.640]   You should take notes.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.720]   You should capture that information into some sort of smart system so that it can be fuel
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.120]   for this external brain that is cybernetically augmenting your cogitation.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.600]   So if you're a big Zettelkasten, for example, adherent, you would be putting notes on in
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.520]   Rome or in Obsidian or in, what's the other one, Notion, and they would be connected with
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.360]   semantic links to other notes and forming this web of knowledge that you could later
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.880]   pull from.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120]   There's all sorts of variations of the similar philosophy.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.200]   Ryan Holiday, for example, copies quotes from books on the index cards and he categorizes
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.000]   them in these big boxes and he can then go back later and find index cards by boxes to
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240]   get the quotes and stories he needs for his book.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.640]   So it's this whole notion of this is fuel for your external brain.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.060]   Get the information into some system where it can form connections, be retrievable later,
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.960]   but also help you generate new ideas.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.680]   That's the Zettelkasten school of thought.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.200]   The other school of thought on book note taking is what I call the pragmatic school, which
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.840]   says only take notes on a book if you have a very specific purpose for which you're using
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   that book.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.160]   Those notes should be serving that purpose.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.400]   So for example, if you think this book will be relevant for a book chapter you are currently
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.200]   writing, then you would take notes on that book for use in that specific book chapter.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.560]   On the other hand, if you're just reading a book because it's interesting, then there's
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   no notes to be taken.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.800]   It's better to focus on reading as much as you can and just enjoying bathing in knowledge.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.840]   That's the pragmatic method.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.680]   It's very focused.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.640]   I am a believer in the pragmatic method.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.880]   I'm not saying it's best.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   I'm just saying this is what I happen to do.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.280]   So let me make this concrete for you.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.320]   As we talked about earlier in the show, working on a new book, a book about slow productivity,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:19.840]   I was just working on the opening to a chapter on the principle of doing fewer things.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.600]   And I wanted to tell the story of Jane Austen and Andrew Wiles.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Andrew Wiles is the Princeton professor who solved Fermat's last theorem back in the early
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   1990s.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   And for various reasons, their stories interleave.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.720]   What I vaguely remembered of them is their stories interleave in interesting ways, and
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.560]   they do a good job of exemplifying the power of actually reducing the number of things
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.080]   in your play as compared to other people in your same circumstance.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.840]   So that was a general idea.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.600]   So I got a biography of Jane Austen, Claire Tomlin's biography, which is excellent, by
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.840]   the way.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   And I got a book on Fermat's last theorem, Simon Singh's book, Fermat's Enigma, which
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.880]   tells the whole story of Andrew Wiles.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.220]   It also tells the whole story of Fermat and et cetera.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.880]   But it's the most comprehensive story of Andrew Wiles and his tackling of the proof.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.560]   I bought those books to write these chapters.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.160]   One of them I already owned, but the other one I bought.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.520]   And I went through and I took notes on those books specifically aimed at what I knew I
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   was going to read.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   Then a couple of days later, I went through those notes and I used it to actually help
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   my reading.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.620]   So that's an example of pragmatic note taking.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.360]   How do I take those notes in this circumstance?
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.620]   Well, this is where I use the before mentioned corner marking method, which is a method for
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.120]   taking notes that focuses on minimizing friction as quickly as possible.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.700]   How can you get the information you need at the fastest possible speed?
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.560]   Because that is the mindset I'm often in when I'm book writing, because there's a lot of
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.820]   books I need to get through.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.700]   So I thought what I would do here is load up our Magic Telestrator.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.760]   So again, if you're listening, you can find this video at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.920]   So Jesse has loaded up here just a sample page from a book.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.120]   This is a page from our friend Greg McKeown's book, Effortless.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.040]   And I'm just going to use the marking tools to actually show you what my marks look like.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   All right, so over here on the right, we see a sample page.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.160]   If there's something in this page that I think is relevant, I put a slash in the corner.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   So imagine that slash I just drew is in the corner of the page.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   Why in the corner?
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.040]   Because when you're flipping through the book, you can quickly identify which pages have
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   the slashes.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.240]   It's right there in the upper right corner or the upper left corner.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.600]   So you can very quickly identify where you have information.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.760]   All right, and then what I do on the actual page is very simple.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.040]   When I find something that's relevant, I'll do one of two things.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:56.160]   I'll either bracket, so I'll bracket off a paragraph, at least I'll try to.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.740]   So for those who are watching online, you can watch me struggle with the pen.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.600]   So again, I'm just bracketing on the outside a paragraph that I think is relevant.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.400]   I'm not writing commentary about it.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.920]   I'm not writing down why I think it's important.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.240]   I'm not putting a lot of notes down.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   I trust my brain that when it sees that bracketed paragraph later, it'll know why.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.720]   The other thing I'll do is underline.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.600]   So like here, I'm underlining if there's like a name or something that seems important,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.520]   or a sentence I particularly like, or it's a sentence in the middle of a paragraph, I
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.760]   don't want to bracket a whole line.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.040]   I want to get the sentence, I'll underline it.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.080]   That's really about it.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.800]   Now, there's two other exceptional things I will do with corner marking.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.340]   Since I know why I'm taking notes, I know why I'm taking the notes.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.300]   If there is a passage that I think is just a home run perfect type of thing I'm looking
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.780]   for, it's not background on example, but like this is what I'm looking for.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.300]   I'll put a star.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.700]   And for those watching at home will see that I drew a perfectly symmetrical star there
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.560]   and are impressed by my graphic design skills.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.340]   And then I'll often then star the corner.
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.500]   So now when I'm flipping through, if I see a star in the corner that I say, oh, that
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.780]   is that's the page with the really good stuff.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.120]   So I can get to that really quickly.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.860]   And the only other thing I'll sometimes do in corner marking is occasionally I'll be
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.200]   looking at an argument I think is important that I want to remember.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.420]   Often arguments and books will be in multiple parts.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:35.040]   It'll say here are the three reasons why, you know, whatever this method doesn't work.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.060]   And so in that case, I'll actually draw numbers next to those reasons where they show up.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.020]   So then I can very quickly know that all of these things I've numbered are part of the
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.020]   same argument.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.940]   So we have a one somewhere and a two somewhere else, et cetera.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.200]   Okay, that's it.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.780]   So it's dead simple with no commentary, nothing copying to another system, no note cards going
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.780]   into a box.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.300]   Now I can tell you from experience.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.960]   I'm on my eighth book now.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.740]   Your brain remembers things.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.700]   So if you flip through these things and you see underlying passages, you see bracketed
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.200]   passages, you see numbered pieces of arguments.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.100]   Your brain is really good at being like, oh, that's really interesting.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.100]   How can we use that?
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   How is that relevant?
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.900]   And it figures it out, right?
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.220]   You don't have to treat your future brain like it's going to somehow be significantly
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.220]   impaired.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.560]   It need to be helped along a lot.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.720]   If you're writing a chapter about doing fewer things and you come to a bracketed off paragraph
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:43.400]   in a Jane Austen biography about the way that her sister Cassandra and her mother were helping
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   her take on taking chores off her plate after they moved to Charlton house in the early
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   19th century, you know why that's relevant.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.880]   You don't have to write a note to yourself about it.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.760]   So it's a very low friction approach, but it works very well.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.320]   It's like I over two days, I read the Austin book.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   I marked it up.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.920]   Then a couple of days later I was writing.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.000]   It took me about five minutes to go through every corner mark page and skim the bracketed
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and underlying lines.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.920]   So in five minutes I have queued up in my brain everything relevant about Jane Austen
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.320]   and is right there in my working memory and I can pull the right lines I need for the
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.760]   thing I'm writing in the moment.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.600]   The system works really well.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.080]   The overhead is minimal.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.060]   I have relied on it for a long time.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.200]   The only other cool thing I'll say about this system is that if you mark up a book
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.360]   for one project and I know this from experience and you come back to that book many years
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.080]   later, probably what you marked is still the most relevant stuff for whatever you're working
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.200]   on.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   It's the stuff that's interesting to you and the type of things you normally work on.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.560]   So I will often go back to already marked books and go through and say, this is all
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.720]   the cool stuff I need anyways.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.640]   It'll be relevant to another project I do.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.480]   Now something people are worried about is defacing books.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.160]   I want you to get over that.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.760]   All right.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:07.120]   Books are incredibly efficient but rich compressed collections of knowledge.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.240]   The whole point and I'm talking nonfiction here.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.720]   The whole point is to make use of that knowledge to make functional the knowledge in that book.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.640]   So adding your markings is part of you decompressing, extracting and putting into use all of the
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.440]   knowledge captured in this codex.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.920]   Now what if you mark up a book for one reason and now you have a completely different reason
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.400]   why you need the book and these marks are no longer relevant.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Here's my suggestion.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.520]   Get ready to clutch your pearls.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.000]   Buy another copy of the book.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.240]   We treat books too preciously.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   Not buying a car here.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.640]   It costs 15 bucks.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.000]   You should buy more books.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.520]   I have already bought just to be, let's make this concrete for this one chapter I'm writing
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.520]   in slow productivity.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   I have already bought seven books as part of my research for this and I am three out
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.720]   of six.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   So about halfway through.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.760]   So I'll probably end up buying, I don't know, 10 books, maybe an even dozen.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.480]   That's three or $400 well spent if I get 10,000 really good words out of it.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:17.160]   I mean, well for the price of lunch at Panera, you could have the polished compressed wisdom
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.640]   of a scholar who spent 20 years working on a topic.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.120]   I mean, it's the best bargain in town.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.320]   We should buy more books.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.960]   And obviously as an author, I have a bias here, but we should buy books, mark up books,
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   buy other copies of books.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.800]   I'll buy second copies of books.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   I'll have multiple copies in different formats of books.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.880]   I'll own it, get rid of it, buy another copy.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.120]   We should have books being a much richer part of our life, a much more common part of our
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   life.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.600]   We shouldn't worry so much about having too much books or keeping the books really precious.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.000]   They're meant to be used, so mark them up.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.920]   So do you do, it's all hard cover, hard copy books?
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.580]   Whatever, I mean, so you mean versus Kindle or hard copy versus paperback?
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580]   Versus Kindle.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.040]   I'll usually, I prefer to have the physical because the corner marking method is very
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   efficient.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.160]   I'll do Kindle.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.840]   How would you go about, you just look at your note, your bookmarks?
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.000]   Yeah, so in Kindle you can highlight using your finger and then you can export.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.900]   So when you're done highlighting a book, you can export and it will actually send to the
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.280]   email address that's associated with your Kindle account, a PDF that has everything
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.840]   you highlighted put, actually pretty nicely formatted.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   Right?
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.080]   So it's actually kind of nice, right?
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.560]   A couple of problems with it though.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.440]   The 25% or something?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.440]   Well, so, so some books, some books will correlate Kindle locations with page numbers in an actual
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.800]   printed edition.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.020]   Some don't.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.880]   So I do not like, and my copy editors and fact checkers do not like when I'm trying
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.240]   to cite something from a book and all you have is a Kindle location.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   Right?
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.600]   So I think that's problem number one.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.240]   Some books don't have this problem.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   Some do.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.960]   I mean, there's ways around it.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.480]   Like not to, not to, again, to give away secrets of the trade, but I know like New York, New
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.520]   Yorker fact checkers often because they don't want to buy every book you used.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.720]   And I used to send them photos of the page or whatever.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.000]   They use Google books often.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.760]   So you can use Google books and search for the particular line and you basically will
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.520]   get a image of the page and you can see like, oh, this is exactly the way the line looked
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   in the books.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.560]   There's a way you can go from, let's say Kindle highlighted quotes and actually get the page
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.860]   number.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:38.040]   But it's nice just to have it to, I use my library like a library, you know, so I like
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   to be able to pull things off.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.040]   I do this all the time.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.640]   I pull things off the shelf and use it for different projects.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.440]   That's harder with Kindle.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.040]   I mean, I know a lot of people are more minimalist about books.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.200]   Like why do we drag all these books around and they just take up so much space and they're
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   heavy.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.440]   I actually use my library like a library.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.120]   I'm constantly pulling books off of it.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.840]   So, so I like having the artifact, but I'll do Kindle, especially if I don't want to wait
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.640]   like, oh man, I got to write this right now.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.060]   And I think this book has a chapter in it I need, I'll just buy the Kindle thing so
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   I can have it.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:11.020]   Um, it's, by the way, it's not uncommon for me to then buy a hardcover paperback version
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.140]   of a book I had in Kindle, you know, I'll get some notes out of it.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.940]   I'm like, this is useful and I'll buy the book.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.540]   So I have it for my library as well.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.020]   So again, I'm happy to buy a book multiple times.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.780]   Do any of these books that you're reading count for your May books?
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.580]   I'm not reading them.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.060]   I'm not counting any of them towards the May books.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.660]   Like for the, for the Austin biography, I'm turning the speed knob up and down.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.060]   So I'm kind of skimming and then I slow down when things are really relevant and then I
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.340]   speed back up.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.020]   Now that's enough for me to have a pretty nuanced understanding, I would say of like
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.340]   Austin's life and the social and economic circumstances in which he lived and the dynamics
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.340]   of her family.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.180]   Like I now know a lot about Jane Austin, but you know, I didn't read every detail, so I
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.700]   don't count it towards the May book.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.740]   For the Fermat's book, I was just reading the chapters about Andrew.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.300]   So I don't count it towards the May books.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.380]   So but if I, if I read every page, then I will.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.740]   When you're doing book, I mean, if I'm going to read a dozen books for this chapter, I'm
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.500]   not going to read every line of those books.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.500]   You're going to be in and out.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.500]   You're going to skip chapters.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.780]   You get really good at variable speed skimming.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.380]   And if you do it well, you can learn a ton.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.740]   You get a lot of context pretty quickly.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.740]   [MUSIC]
