[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   "Your happiness doesn't increase after $70,000 a year."
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.180]   Well, and they kind of went through the data
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.620]   and get again and dug through it.
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.120]   And basically, happiness does keep increasing
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.320]   above $70,000 a year in income and with wealth, et cetera.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.620]   They've looked at wealth and income.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.880]   But the issue is you have to already be happy, right?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.060]   If you're not a happy person,
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.460]   more money's not gonna make you happier.
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.280]   And that's what the original study found.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.900]   But if you're happy and you're loving life,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'm telling you more money's
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   gonna probably make you happier.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.360]   Does that mean you need to chase it?
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.660]   No, I don't know why people are saying otherwise.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.040]   I just don't wanna mislead people
