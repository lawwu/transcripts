[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   We had dinner last week and Saks and I got bombed last week.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.640]   We had dinner and we drank a quadruple.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.100]   Casa, I've not seen Jekyll drink like that before.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.440]   I stopped in for a few minutes drinking.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.320]   I mean, Casa Azul.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.020]   He tore my house apart getting back in.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.480]   Oh, my God, like a bear, like a bear.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120]   I went Brooklyn, so he was like a bear.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.380]   He was like a drunk bear.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.160]   But I spoke to the lady of the manor and I will be staying at Saks's house next time.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.300]   So I will be able to refresh the ranch's soap and towels.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.560]   Yeah, I'm staying at your place.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560]   I mean, you know what?
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.660]   I forgot to get towels when I was at Chamonte.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.400]   It's got this amazing embroidered towel.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.080]   So I'll just hit those up when I hit your place.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.840]   It's really funny to go to Jekyll Ranch and there's going to be a big S on his towels.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.880]   Why is there an S on it?
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.120]   I got the robe that says yes on it.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.380]   I've got a robe on the back.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.220]   It says MAGA.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.500]   I took all the MAGA robes.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.960]   What does the S stand for?
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   It's grifter.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.960]   Oh, it's so funny.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   Steals.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.960]   He's got a bunch of towels that say C as well, cheap.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:36.640]   All right, listen, happy Halloween to everybody, and we've got a great docket for you today,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   but I just up front wanted to let people know that we will be having the all in holiday
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.980]   spectacular on December 7th at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.980]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.560]   All in dot com slash events and next Tuesday.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560]   That's right.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.600]   November 5th.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.800]   If you go to our YouTube at 7 p.m. Pacific Time, 10 p.m. Eastern Time, we're going to
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.880]   do an election night live stream for the fans.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.820]   We're almost at 700000 subscribers.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.920]   So subscribe to comment and join us on our live stream on Tuesday night.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   There'll be guests.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   Right.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   There's going to be some fun guests.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   I think Helmuth is still banned by Chamath for life, but I may bring him on and let him
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   give him a second chance.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   Chamath, is that OK?
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   I bring him on for a second chance.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   Sure.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.040]   OK, so we're going to give Helmuth a second chance, but we'll see.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.920]   He's going to be on a very tight leash if he makes it about himself in seven seconds
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   or less.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   Seven seconds to fill Helmuth.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.480]   He's going to get kicked right off the show.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   OK.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480]   Holiday party.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   Do we know that?
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.760]   Go to all in dot com slash events if you want to come.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.480]   It's going to be great.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.400]   You guys aren't going to be happy, but we are setting we are going to spend a million
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   dollars on this party.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   How did you spend a million dollars on a party?
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.840]   Dude, did you see the set he built last time?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.320]   That sounds like a lot of founders.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.360]   That's a lot of it's going to be about 300,000.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.140]   We'll probably lose money on the party, but it's going to be it's not meant to be call
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.200]   it a profit center, but it's just going to be super fun.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.840]   You cannot put a price on a good time.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.320]   And, you know, if you're going to get that premium founder mode, did you always want
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.180]   to be a party promoter when you were like in high school and in college?
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.920]   When I was in college, I had a DJ set up.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.320]   I had like synthesizer set up, which I plugged in and I did live electronic music with my
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   DJ set.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   I'm going to drop the beat.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   Chamath.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   I'm going to drop the beat.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.000]   A couple of my startups now are doing something interesting.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.200]   Athena is bought like a pack of tickets and they're doing like a holiday party there with
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   their top for our event, for our event.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.220]   They basically bought a bundle of VIP tickets and they're giving them to the top customers
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.200]   and their top employees to come.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   That's cool.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.760]   And make it like their holiday party in San Francisco with our customers.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.920]   So that's kind of neat, smart move by them.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.280]   And so if you have a startup and you want to bring your startup, you can buy a pack
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.840]   of tickets as it were.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   That's actually a really good idea.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.600]   A bunch of these small startups should just co-opt our holiday party as your holiday.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Precisely.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   Just buy 10 tickets and come.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.840]   If Freebird's going to go blow a million bucks, you might as well co-opt it.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.740]   I'm hopeful today we're going to sign this DJ, which is everyone.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.320]   Everyone knows the DJ and it is going to be pretty sick if we can get it.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   It's a degenerate gambler.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   We know him.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   We play poker with him.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.000]   Whenever we pay him, he's going to lose twice as much at the poker game.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.200]   Let's just, let's call it what it is.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.760]   Sax, can you host poker at your house after the party?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   No.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   What a team player.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.880]   He built an entire poker building and he's used it like seven times.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.840]   David Sax is just the absolute best.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   All right.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   Let's get to work.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080]   You know what's winning as well is the US GDP.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   Here we go.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   It grew slightly slower than expected, but the top line numbers are healthy.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.520]   Looks like the soft landing might be baked in.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   We'll see.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.120]   On Wednesday, the Department of Commerce reported that real GDP grew 2.8% in Q3.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.560]   That means it's adjusted for inflation.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.260]   And you can't look at these things in a vacuum.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.520]   You have to look at the other Western countries and their GDP, Japan 0.7, Australia 0.2,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   Germany 0.2, Canada 0.5.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.120]   The world is not growing.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.200]   US is growing briskly.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.560]   And in terms of how to think about it, 2% to 3% is sort of the sweet spot for mature
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   economies.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.240]   Above 3%, positive, but can also signal overheating like we experienced during Zerp and in 2021.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.400]   Under 2%, yeah, stagnation.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.680]   US GDP was 30 basis points below the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 3.1%.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   There's your chart if you missed it.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.600]   And obviously inflation, we talked about this last week, is at 2.4%, very close to the 2%
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   target.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.400]   Unemployment, 4.1%, close to historic lows, 10-year treasury, 4.3%, and obviously stock
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.040]   market at its all-time high again.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.880]   There's your S&P, Dow, and NASDAQ.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.960]   As we've talked about over and over again, Shamath, the federal debt is the issue, $35
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   trillion in debt.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.000]   We have a trillion in annual interest payments on that debt.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.760]   And Freiburg, your pet peeve, $23.5 million directly and millions more indirectly.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.720]   As we know, federal government employees now at $3 million, it's about 1% of the country.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.880]   And state government employees, $5.5 million, local governments, $15 million.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.520]   Put it all together and we got almost 25 million people working for our government.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.000]   What do you think the prescription here is, Freiburg, as we come up on election day and
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.240]   we look towards next year, do you believe we can cut this crazy spending?
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.320]   What do you think's going to happen to the economy?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.360]   Will it overheat, soft landing?
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   You're running a company now, so you have to think about this, obviously.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   Well, I'll separate running a company because I think that's got to be treated independently
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   from macro.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.120]   You can't build your business around macro.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.440]   But 10-year treasuries are sitting at just around 4.3%.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.840]   I think what the market is telling us, and remember, that's off of a low right when the
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.080]   rate cuts were happening, if you'll remember, in mid-September, we got down to just around
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.440]   3.5%.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.400]   The market is telling us that with the sort of economic growth we're seeing, low unemployment,
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.880]   and call it modest inflation, this is not the time to be cutting rates.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.400]   And the market is saying we are expecting higher rates for longer.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.200]   So I do think that that's one big kind of turnaround that's happened in the last 90
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.320]   days, which is really, I think, a big surprise to a lot of folks, is just how robust things
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.640]   are relative to where folks thought that they were about 90 days ago, urging, pleading,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.920]   and supposedly needing a big rate cut to get the economy moving again.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.760]   But I think at the end of the day, everyone's looking to the election as kind of the next
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.800]   big moment in the economy.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:13.320]   Both Trump and Kamala have made fiscal proposals that would be deeply expensive.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.800]   If you assume these budgeting groups that go out and take their policy proposals and
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.560]   try and build a model against them, that they're both going to add trillions of dollars
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.280]   to the debt, they're going to increase deficit spending, etc.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.900]   But the reality is that neither of them are actually going to end up theoretically being
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.360]   able to execute all of those policies.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.440]   And there will likely be some degree of difference to where we end up on spending.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   >>Corey: That's a great point.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   Chamath, a lot of talk about DOGE, the Department of Government, what is the last word?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   >>Chamath: Efficiency.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   >>Corey: Efficiency.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.240]   I think Elon might be collaborating on, what do you think the chances are?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.680]   He said there could be $2 trillion in savings that could occur.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.440]   What are the chances that any meaningful cuts happen and we reverse the trend if Trump,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.960]   say he wins and he creates that position?
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:10.360]   >>Kamala: I think the first question that'll inform how dramatic the cuts are is whether
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:18.020]   we organize ourselves around an accurate sense of where the actual economy is.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:24.800]   If you look at the print today, it would actually tell you that things are pretty okay and that
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.560]   we are not sort of near an unsustainable turning point.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:37.000]   However, and Nick, if you want to just throw up this chart, if you back out the percentage
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.240]   of government consumption that is included in GDP, you start to see a very different
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:52.200]   picture, which is that over the last two and a half years, all of the economic gains under
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.520]   the Biden administration have largely been through government consumption.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:06.040]   What that means is that private industry has been standing on the sidelines somewhat.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:12.280]   That actually maps to a lot of this intuition that I've had over the last few months when
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.860]   I've said, "I think we're in a low key recession," because what I could never figure out is why
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.760]   I would look at the earnings transcripts of a bunch of companies who would constantly
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.040]   talk about softening demand.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.540]   By the way, this is across the board.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.440]   It wasn't just CPG companies, but Dropbox as an example, same sort of thing.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.820]   They just laid off 20% of their staff and the memo was about weakening demand.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:43.360]   This is a broad-based softening as far as companies experience the economy, but the
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   high-level number is positive, which would make you think that everything is fine.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.760]   When you look at that chart and you back out the percentage of the positive news that the
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.960]   government is responsible for, what it means is the economy is flat and the economy isn't
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.120]   growing, which means that roughly there are a bunch of folks that are seeing contraction.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:13.140]   I think that if you normalize on that view of the world, I think the cuts that Elon will
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:18.840]   affect will be meaningful and necessary.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.600]   If you pull up this chart, Nick, of the federal net outlays as a percentage of GDP, you get
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.840]   a good idea of the spending.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.000]   You're at a flat, stalling economy.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.720]   >>Corey: Well, if you look at this, we basically have had high teens during our lifetime, Clinton
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:43.040]   era, '70s and '80s, and then it's gone up into the '20s now, so that is definitely something
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.720]   the amount of spending we're doing.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.160]   >>Corey: Again, this is where you can get a little confused by data.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.760]   Jason, this is net outlays, and that's different from total gross government spending, which
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.760]   also includes QE.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.120]   If you go back to the other chart, why is this one going down and the other one represents
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.280]   85% of GDP?
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   It's because that one is a more accurate sense of what the government is doing across all
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.480]   of its tentacles in the United States economy.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:15.820]   It includes the money printer going brr, which the net outlays chart doesn't include.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:21.220]   Just to be clear about what's happening, 85% of this quarter's GDP was induced by the government.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:29.280]   If you sub it out, so take 2.8% and multiply it by 0.15, that is the true growth X the
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.160]   United States government that exists in the United States economy today.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:40.400]   >>Corey: Sax, your thoughts here on the GDP, obviously looks pretty good for Biden-Harris
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.040]   to have all these stats going in their favor, but there is the caveat, obviously, about
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.720]   the government spending in there.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   >>Saxe: Yeah.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   No, I think that's right.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.240]   I mean, I think that for Harris in this election, it's probably a little too late for this GDP
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.800]   report to be helpful.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.880]   If you go back all the way to 1992 where the whole election hinged on the economy, remember
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.480]   that was Bill Clinton running against George H.W. Bush and Clinton's message was, "It's
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   the economy, stupid."
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   >>Corey: Yep.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   >>Saxe: And-
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   >>Corey: Carville, right?
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   Came up with that.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.680]   >>Saxe: Yeah, Carville said, and Clinton beat Bush because we had a recession in, I think,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.840]   '91.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:27.200]   But by '92, it was over already, and in the final week of the campaign, Bush tried to
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.240]   tout a similarly positive GDP report that showed 2.7% growth.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.920]   That report would later be revised up to 3.9% growth.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.960]   So the recession was definitely over and the economy was growing again, and nonetheless,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:49.080]   Bush lost because voters' impressions of the economy had already formed and solidified
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.600]   by the final week of the campaign.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.080]   So I think it's probably too late here for the GDP numbers to have a big impact on the
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   election.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.880]   I think the other thing is that voters' impression of this economy isn't based so much on the
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   GDP numbers.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.800]   It's really based on their perception of inflation over the last four years, and there's no question
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.320]   the cost of living has increased a lot over the last four years, and voters are really
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.640]   feeling that.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:23.160]   And that, I think, is playing into their perceptions of the economy, and I don't think that Harris
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.480]   has a great answer for that.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.800]   So I think the bottom line here is I don't think this report's going to have a big impact
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.300]   on the election.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:37.800]   In terms of where the economy is going, the thing that I would come back to is interest
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.520]   rates, and this is the thing that Freeberg was talking about, which is even though the
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.720]   Fed has cut rates by 50 basis points, the long-term rates, the 10-year treasury, has
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   not gone down.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.600]   In fact, it's gone up slightly.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.820]   It's gone up to, call it, 4.3%.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.240]   And so we have this real issue where, as the Fed is cutting short rates, long rates are
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   not going down.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.920]   And I think that is because of the government deficit and the government debt and the fact
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.840]   that there's so much debt that needs to be serviced by the bond market.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.400]   And the market for treasuries.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.200]   The buyers are all leaving the market for treasuries.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.280]   The Chinese, we talked about this last week, have been selling down their treasury position.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.740]   There just aren't buyers anymore, which is-- Right, and I think this could ultimately have
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.600]   a very detrimental effect on the economy.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.920]   You already saw that.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.680]   I think this hasn't been widely reported, but I think it should be a major piece of
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.320]   news, which is the prime rate hit 8% today.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.880]   So now it had a seven-handle on it before, and now it has an eight-handle on it.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.640]   Well, this matters a lot if you want to buy a house and get a mortgage.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.480]   It's much more expensive.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.160]   Then you got to think about all the people who already have debt.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.920]   Doesn't this look recessionary?
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:00.480]   Totally, because a few years ago, you could get a home loan at a 3% to 4% interest rate.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.760]   You know, and amortize that.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.000]   Now your debt service cost can be twice as high.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.280]   So you just can't buy as much house.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.480]   It's a very bad place if the economy is in the toilet, but we can't even talk about it
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.440]   because there is no structural way to get an accurate read because the government just
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   perverts the effect it has in the economy.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.480]   Like you can't have-- Distortions, yeah.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Yeah, distortion.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   Fine.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   You can't have a nonprofit entity representing the plurality of the economic activity of
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.680]   a country and expect the capital markets to function properly.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.840]   At some point, the capital markets will basically throw their hands up in the air and puke it
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.760]   all out and say, "No."
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.960]   I think that you're starting to see a little bit of these fissures.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.800]   So I think we're going to have to clean up our balance sheet pretty aggressively here.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.560]   Yeah, and if you look at the importance of that rate, that rate drives the value of bonds.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.800]   As the current market rate for treasuries or for the prime rate climbs, the value of
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:10.760]   an existing bond that pays interest at a lower rate goes down because you have to pay a lower
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.040]   basis in order to get back to the new high rate that the market is telling you.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.760]   So there are several trillion dollars, and we can pull up the graph here, Nick, of loans
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.600]   and bonds that are sitting on the balance sheets of many commercial banks in the United
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:31.580]   States that are now so significantly underwater, where the value is now below the book that
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:37.040]   they paid for those loans or that they issued them at, that those banks now have unrealized
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.600]   losses.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.160]   I think that this number is one of the other kind of facts.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.960]   You see a few articles come out here and there about this, but the number as the rates go
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.840]   up, the number of unrealized losses, the dollar value of the unrealized losses of banks' balance
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.280]   sheets in the United States has climbed so considerably that it represents a real crisis.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.000]   In fact, the unrealized losses on banks' balance sheets today is higher than it was in 2008.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Trillions.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's trillions.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's trillions.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Buffett warned B of A publicly.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.680]   But he's been selling off.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   He sold off, right?
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   B of A.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   He warned B of A publicly, although a bit obliquely, last year during his annual conference.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240]   It was very clear.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.680]   It's like, "Listen, this is an opportunity for folks to just mark to market these securities
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.400]   properly and/or sell them and get them off the books."
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.960]   I don't think B of A acted quickly enough.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.960]   What did Buffett do?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.460]   He just basically started dumping.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:36.120]   He's almost completely out of B of A, if not completely out altogether.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.120]   There's a lot of talk-
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.760]   A crisis is brewing.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:45.160]   There's a lot of talk in FinTWIT, if you go into the deep, far-reaching bowels of the
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.000]   FinTWIT community on X, that there is a huge credit crisis looming amongst some of these
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.400]   large charter-holding banks because of this exact issue.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.280]   The relation between the Fed and the prime is typically 3%.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:06.040]   The Fed cuts rates, and then the banks put 3% on top of it when they give people credit
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.260]   worthy people, mortgages and credit cards.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:14.480]   As the Fed cuts, this should come down, but if it went up, what explains that?
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.200]   I'm curious if anybody knows.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.560]   The Fed sets short rates.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:23.360]   It sets the Fed funds rate, which is the rate of overnight lending between banks, but it
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.560]   does not set the 10-year treasury, for example, the long-term-
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   The market sets that.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   The market sets that.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   The market sets it.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:36.120]   It now requires a higher rate of interest in order to accept the risk of investing in
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.440]   those bonds.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.760]   Since it's a U.S. treasury, it's not really risk, it's more about the time value of money
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.800]   and their expectations of inflation, how much that money is going to be worth in the future.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.240]   I think what we're seeing is that the Fed can cut short-term rates, but it hasn't had
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.600]   the impact on long-term rates that everyone was expecting.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.720]   I think everyone was expecting that we had this sort of burst in inflation, the famous
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.640]   9% inflation rate.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.720]   I think people were expecting that that would work its way through the system and that we'd
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.440]   get long-term rates back to where they were, but that's not happening.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.120]   It's not happening for the reason we're saying, which is there's just too much debt out there.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.000]   Think about the impact on the real economy.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.760]   Let's say that you're a homebuyer and you got a five-year interest-only ARM-type mortgage
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   for your house.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   Tick-tock.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.520]   Now, you probably got that in the 3% to 4% range.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.240]   If you have to refinance it this year at 8%, your monthly payment is going to double.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.080]   That has a real impact on people's wealth and on their spending power.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.680]   Maybe they can't even support a payment like that.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.400]   Now, go over to the commercial side and it's very similar.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.680]   There's a lot of commercial real estate out there, buildings and so on, where they've
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.400]   got debt on it.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.120]   You can't get 30-year mortgages in commercial.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.560]   The typical commercial loan is five to seven years.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.200]   We're now coming up, I think, in the next few years on a lot of that debt will need
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   to roll.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.460]   It'll need to be refinanced.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:18.320]   If it gets refinanced at twice the interest cost, roughly, a lot of those buildings may
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   be underwater.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   I mean, they may not be in composite.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.320]   There's no equity value.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.480]   There may be no equity value.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.680]   A lot of people know this now, but they don't really have to mark those positions to market.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:34.300]   If they did, their equity was zero, but they're all on borrowed time right now, hoping that
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.600]   rates will go back down.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.340]   What we're seeing is that the long rates are not going back down.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340]   It's a pretty scary proposition.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.900]   Then, of course, a lot of the debt on those buildings, it's all owned by the commercial
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.600]   banks that you're talking about, the regional banks.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.960]   They're sending out a lot of bad debt that they haven't had to mark to market.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:59.420]   They're just kind of hoping that this problem will get sorted out before there's a default.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:04.740]   By the way, as these numbers climb, the cost to borrow for the federal government climbs.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.640]   The new bonds, we have to reissue a good percent, I think nearly $10 trillion, I think, of our
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.160]   debt has to be reissued in the next year.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.120]   That's going to get reissued now at this higher rate.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.600]   That higher rate means that the annual expense just to pay the interest on the existing debt
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.120]   is now climbing at a faster rate.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.800]   That means you've got to issue more debt to pay for your interest on your current debt.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.360]   It's quite paradoxical that the Fed sets that rate.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   This becomes the compounding problem when your debt to GDP reaches a certain level and
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.080]   you don't reduce federal spending fast enough.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.000]   It becomes a compounding problem you cannot get away from.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.760]   This has been the beginning of the cataclysmic economic collapse of every great empire in
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   the last 500 years.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   I know I've said this.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.840]   I could talk about it all day long, but this is how it starts, is it starts at a point
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.160]   where you're arithmetically not able to get out of your debt spiral.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.000]   The markets are telling us that if the U.S. doesn't take drastic action in reducing its
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.440]   spending and reducing the deficit levels so that we can actually address the payment obligations
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.040]   on the outstanding debt that we've already issued, the U.S. dollar is going to have a
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.720]   real problem and the creditworthiness of the United States is challenged.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.840]   That's what the market says, but I know that there's other issues with the fact that there's
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.480]   no other better place to put money today and there's not a lot of other great economies
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.200]   out there and so on and so forth, but the stability of the United States, the hegemony
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   of the United States and the dollar is challenged in part by the fact that you've got this BRICS
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.000]   organization out there now that has greater GDP in aggregate than the U.S., and so there
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.920]   may be an alternative that emerges in the next couple of years and maybe everyone's
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:41.120]   kind of putting their assets away in gold and Bitcoin and other stuff while they're
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.600]   waiting for the transition to find another place to buy.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.600]   We'll see.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   All right.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   Well, it's scary.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   But what it implies is if rates have roughly doubled, let's say, in the last few years
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.120]   and they're going to stay at that level, they're not going back down, it implies there's going
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.600]   to be a big deleveraging, right, because, you know, you can't support those interest
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   payments.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.440]   I mean, let's say that you own a building, right, and now all of a sudden…
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:12.040]   Well, it's actually deleveraging or inflation because the alternative is the Fed monetizes
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.200]   the debt, they start buying all the bonds, which means you're pumping more U.S. dollars
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.920]   into the market, and that means that the cost of everything goes through the roof, so you
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   have this effect of economic inflation, which is the way that you inflate away the debt
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.680]   problem, assuming people still want to use your currency.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   Well, I mean, that's at the government level.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.920]   I mean, I was talking about the private sector.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.520]   I mean, just think about it at the level of, like, an individual building, you've got
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.480]   a loan on it, now you need to refinance the loan, interest rates are twice as high, let's
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.080]   just say that that doesn't… the building no longer produces operating income at that
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.920]   level of debt, so you have to pay down some of your debt.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.640]   It's called an equity in refinancing, where you're not pulling money out, you're putting
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   money in.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.920]   You have to deleverage in order to make your sort of income statement work, right?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.800]   It's just too much debt at that new level of interest rates.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.760]   So if rates stay high, there's no choice but for many people to delever, whether it's on
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.640]   the commercial side or on the consumer side.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.000]   You just can't afford as much debt, right, at that higher interest rate.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.880]   So think about the impact that has on the economy when everyone has to delever.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.680]   That's a very negative effect.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.320]   And then, of course, like you're saying, at the government level, you have to figure out
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.120]   what to do about that, because our interest payments on the debt are already, what, 20
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   to 25% of federal revenue?
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   Yeah, it's about $1.5 trillion.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   $1.5 trillion, yeah.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   It's about $2,500.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:37.640]   So you already see it there, where there's less money to spend on current programs because
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.200]   you're paying for interest on the debt.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.060]   So what do you do about that?
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.560]   So I think that the next president is going to face a pretty wicked set of problems and
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   trade-offs here.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.360]   Even though the GDP numbers are fine, they're good, I still think there's like a wicked
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.720]   set of problems related to government debt and interest rates.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.960]   And there's no way to really skin this cat without some pain.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   I think the only path is you have to cut spending, which is recessionary, government spending,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.400]   which is recessionary, so you're going to trigger an economic recession.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.240]   You're going to have to have some amount of inflation, and you're going to have to have
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   a spike in unemployment.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   And if you don't do the first two things, you're going to have a lot more inflation,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.160]   which is really hard to get out of.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   Well, I agree.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   I agree that we have to cut.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.680]   There doesn't seem to be a win-win scenario here.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   There's no, yeah.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.840]   I agree we have to cut government spending.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.240]   I personally don't think it's recessionary.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.160]   I think it helps the private sector when government gets cut.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.160]   However...
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:38.040]   Because, Saxe, that means the private sector gets to service that function.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.360]   The government won't be consuming all these resources that the private sector could use
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   better.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.520]   It also won't have as many government bureaucrats acting as brake pedals on the private sector.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.880]   So I tend to think that the government, the real economy will perform better with a smaller
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   government.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.800]   I think the reason why it won't happen is because it's politically difficult.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.600]   It's extremely difficult to cut spending politically, right?
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   Right.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   Well, I mean, as we saw this cycle, every single proposal seemed to be a payoff to different
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   constituencies.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   It was like Christmas for everybody.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   Right.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.640]   Those line items got in the budget somehow, right?
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.000]   Somebody fought for every single line item in the budget, some special interest, and
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.840]   they're going to fight like hell to keep their appropriation.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.400]   It's not even special interest.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.520]   It's the representatives in Congress doing their job, which is to fight for their constituents
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.680]   getting their fair share or their fair shake at the money that's being spent.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.080]   And that's just the way that the legislative branch has evolved over time.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.960]   If someone's getting something in order for me to vote for it, I want to get something
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   too.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.800]   And so the whole thing over time becomes functionally inflationary.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   Right.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   I've seen it.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.400]   I think that whole shell game might just be over now because there's no more money left.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   I mean, it's all been spent.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.140]   In fact, you know what I mean?
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:59.920]   So like all the federal government probably will end up doing in the near future is entitlements
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   and defense.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   That's it.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.360]   Because those are the core functions of the federal government.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.680]   I think everything else that's sort of "discretionary" is probably going to get cut because there's
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.200]   no more money left.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.280]   Tragedy of the commons, folks.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.800]   Everybody acting in their self-interest and yeah, not a lot of coordination or ability
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.680]   to win office if you actually do what's in everybody's collective best interest and take
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.240]   the medicine.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.800]   Moving on through the docket, tech earnings this week, Google has a great quarter.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.520]   Let's go over that a bit here, your alma mater, Freiburg.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.400]   They beat top line and bottom line.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.440]   Stock popped 5%.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.280]   Looks like cloud and YouTube are the story here.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:47.520]   Total revenue, let this sink in, 88.3 billion, up 15% year over year.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.960]   Freiburg was 49 billion of that.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.360]   And their operating income is now up 34% year over year.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.480]   I think the CFO is getting some work done there, 28.5 billion, and net income was 26.3
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.640]   billion.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.440]   Interestingly, people are expecting even larger profits.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.160]   They got a new CFO over there who said they could push a little further on cost cutting.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.760]   And she said the company will use AI to cut costs by streamlining workflows and managing
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.120]   headcount physical footprint.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.440]   I think that means more layoffs are coming to big tech.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:29.200]   YouTube had a tremendous quarter, ad revenue 8.9 billion, Chamath, that's up 12%.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.840]   But Sundar said something interesting.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.020]   He said YouTube surpassed 50 billion in total revenue over the past year.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:41.400]   And so if you do a little botte math, that's the back of the envelope math for those of
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.900]   you at home who haven't heard that acronym.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.480]   Google doesn't report YouTube's non ad revenue, but we know YouTube had 35 billion in ad revenue
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.080]   over the last year.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.160]   That means they're doing about 15 billion in premium paid products.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.360]   YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, YouTube Premium, which is the greatest product ever, it takes
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.140]   ads out of YouTube, and makes it usable.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:11.240]   So 70/30 split, cloud had a blowout quarter, Google Cloud, I see that all the time now.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.840]   11.4 billion in revenue on 35% annual growth with 1.9 billion in operating profit.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.280]   I mean, it's printing money.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.720]   There are seven quasi monopolies in the world.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.600]   They're all American, and if we allow them to flourish, we'll be good.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:37.160]   If we hamper them a little bit, and allow other companies to pick up the white space,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.280]   we'll be great.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   Over to you.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   Okay.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   There's your, that's called analysis.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.300]   And what if we break them up, Chamath?
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.460]   And if we break them up?
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:51.000]   I think that you'll have a lot more, the sum is greater than the parts.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.880]   I mean, clearly YouTube would be one of the great companies right now.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:02.920]   If you take the perspective of, if you own stock in any of these companies, the sum of
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.200]   the parts analysis would tell you that the breakup value is greater than the way that
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.700]   these companies get discounted.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.480]   You can look at the multiples that they trade at, and you can see that.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.640]   So if you're a shareholder of the company, you actually silently probably want them broken
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.400]   up because you'll get individual shares that are each will be worth more.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:27.080]   Separately, if you are a shareholder of the United States economy, you also probably want
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.760]   them broken up because then you'll just have many more companies creating economic value,
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:38.400]   which then drives the tax rolls, which benefit the United States balance sheet.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:45.440]   It's hard to see unless you're an employee of the company, or you derive a lot of ego
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.960]   from the existence of a company the way it is, that you would need it to stay where how
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.960]   it is.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.440]   Well, let me challenge your point on two fronts.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:59.400]   In Google's case, both YouTube and GCP required many, many, many, many billions of dollars
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.880]   of investment over many years.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.800]   Same with Waymo, by the way, at this point, that took a long time and a lot of capital
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.600]   to get the payback on.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.920]   If those were standalone businesses, and they didn't have the profits being derived from
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   search and ads over many years, they would not have been able to build those incredible
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   businesses.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.040]   So if you do break these businesses up, what you do lose is the ability for an American
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.840]   juggernaut to be able just like Amazon did with AWS, and Apple did, and we can go through
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.360]   the list to build these new businesses that require the cash flows from the old businesses.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.160]   With separate companies, it becomes much harder to make that degree of an investment.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   That your set angle, that angle of belly aching is not going to pass muster because it's all
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.840]   about litigating the past.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.520]   And you got to play the ball where it lies, where it lies is this business is in a position
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.520]   where you can probably demarcate four or five logical business units.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.920]   Again, I'm not saying that it should have for sure, but it will happen and the argument
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.040]   of but the past is not going to work.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.640]   I'm not disagreeing with your point about like, hey, if these things broke up, people
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.640]   would make money.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   I'm just I'm just trying to understand this point about American dynamism or whatever
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.360]   you want to call it, that these companies are all in America, they've all been successful
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.800]   because they've been led by amazing founders.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:21.280]   They've reinvested so much of the profit they've generated back into building insane new businesses
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.320]   that took a lot of capital and a lot of time.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.760]   And eventually they paid off.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.880]   And they became the next generation of ginormous new businesses that would have not have possibly
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.760]   existed if not for the will and the cash flows coming from those old businesses.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.440]   But you also have a companion economy in the capital markets where there's hundreds of
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.940]   billions of dollars that go and fill in the gaps.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.640]   And I think the reality is the people in the capital markets are not stupid.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.400]   And if these big companies hadn't spent hundreds of billions of dollars, the capital markets
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.400]   would have.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.480]   So I don't think that if Google, let's just play a scenario and I'm not trying to relitigate
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   the past.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.040]   But if Google did not own YouTube, what do you think would have been fine would have
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.680]   gotten funded and it would have been fine.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.320]   It would have raised the billions and the reason for it because you do you remember
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.880]   YouTube had a real infrastructure under a serious lawsuit.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.320]   I think they would have shut down.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:14.040]   The reason is because people are smart enough to understand when then there's the potential
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.320]   to make money.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   Okay.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.720]   And the free markets do a really good job of highlighting where that's possible.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.960]   Again, there is no point relitigating this, but I think it would have gotten funded.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.200]   Why didn't AWS get funded with $10 million?
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   Because that's what open is, right?
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.800]   Why does why does core weave get funded today?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.720]   How is core weave allowed to even exist?
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.920]   Why doesn't it all go?
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.120]   Because investors are smart.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.240]   They see that there's an economic rationale for there being multiple players.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.080]   And then there's a smart founding team that creates a justification that gets it going.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.480]   So the era of the monopolies monopoly on building new monopolies is over.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.640]   I don't think it's I don't think it's ever existed, but I think the point is that big
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:05.240]   businesses are there to eventually grow a GDP so that they can be disrupted by small
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   companies.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.960]   That's what you want, because if you had the same seven or eight companies, then you could
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.640]   make the argument that we should have stopped at the East West India Company and everything
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   would have been great.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   It's not true.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.920]   It is what we did with the railroads.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.200]   It's what we did with the AT&T.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.680]   It's what we did with Standard Oil.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.640]   Like when these when these monopolies were built in the US, they were all broken up.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   But hold on.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   It's not necessarily what we did.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.280]   It's the boundary conditions that enabled other people to then go and fill the gaps.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.600]   And I think that that's the economic boundary conditions.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.080]   You know, Sachs had this great tweet this past week, and I almost quote tweeted it,
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.320]   but I thought I don't want to create a lot more noise where there doesn't need to be
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.680]   paying attention now.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.840]   But he had this tweet about taking back the licenses for the main broadcast channels.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.280]   And I thought that was an excellent thing.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.320]   And I quote tweeted something where I was like, yeah, we should buy that for all in.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.960]   And I said it half jokingly, but I didn't.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.480]   Because I think that if those licenses were up for grabs, what would happen is a bunch
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.320]   of private equity people would get behind Rogan, a bunch of private equity people would
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.360]   get behind us and we would all bid and the outcome would be better.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:22.880]   So the point is that these small structural changes, and I know that it may seem large
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.920]   to break up Google.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   It's not.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.960]   It's a small thing in the grand course of American business history.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.480]   It's not going to really matter that much.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.560]   Would be good generally through the lens of the individual shareholder and through the
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.840]   lens of the shareholder of the United States.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   That's Sachs.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.520]   Can you tell us about the broadcast licensing comment that you made?
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.040]   I thought it was actually pretty good, too.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.400]   Yeah, there's a history to this.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:52.760]   I mean, originally in the US, we had three major broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, and
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.800]   they were given licenses of public spectrum from the FCC.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.400]   And those licenses were free.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.240]   But in exchange for them, the major broadcast networks had these various requirements to
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.360]   serve the public interest to be fair, pre pre cable.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   And this was right.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.920]   This goes back like 100 years, just to be I think it's important to be clear, because
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:19.120]   I don't think everyone understands that back in the day, all the TV networks only broadcast
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   over the air.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.220]   So they needed radio spectrum allocated to them to do that.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.120]   Which was a you know, 100 year old kind of that's 100 year old situation doesn't exist
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   anymore.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   Sorry.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:37.720]   It was the only way to get information broadcast on TV was through this, this public spectrum.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.960]   And so it kind of made sense in a world in which there are only three networks.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.440]   Because that was the only way to get information to have these fairness requirements and public
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.040]   interest requirements.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.640]   And so it was heavily regulated.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:56.080]   Well, now it's a century later, and there's so many ways to get information.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:03.520]   You've got cable, obviously, meant that we went from three or four networks to hundreds.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.920]   And then of course, you've got the internet, and you've got streaming.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:14.160]   So there's now an infinite number of ways to get information in real time, including
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   video and that sort of thing.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.600]   You've also got social networks, you've got x, and all the rest.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.760]   So there's no shelf space limit anymore.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   There's no scarcity.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:31.480]   And so therefore, tying up this very valuable spectrum, by giving it for free to the to
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.660]   the broadcast networks, this doesn't really make sense in the same way.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:41.040]   And what we should do is just auction off the spectrum, use the money to pay down the
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.120]   national debt.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.440]   And then in that way, it'll go to its most highly valued use, the market will figure
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.080]   out what that use is.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.160]   If the broadcast networks are the most highly valued way to use this spectrum, then they'll
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   win the auction.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.160]   But I suspect they won't.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   Isn't that exactly what they did?
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.440]   They did this auction in 2016, right, for 15 years?
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.600]   They've been gradually auctioning off more spectrum.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:10.840]   But we're talking about here, this is like the most choice valuable part of public spectrum.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:17.760]   So for example, one of the reasons why the spectrum is valuable is because it can easily
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.840]   go through walls, right?
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.800]   Like, you can watch your TV inside your house, and this broadcast spectrum is good at getting
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.600]   through those walls.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:31.880]   Imagine the types of GPS apps you could enable with that kind of precision, right?
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   So there's many other ways, in theory, that the spectrum could be used.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.000]   And you would be able to unleash, I think, a lot of innovation in next generation wireless
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.120]   apps if the spectrum were available.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:49.960]   I don't think the public would lose anything because ABC, CBS, NBC, first of all, I mean,
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.160]   these networks are basically a commodity now.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.280]   There's so many other ways to get news, and they'll still be available through the internet
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   and through cable.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.400]   So you're saying to speed up these auctions, because they do occur every 15 years or something
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400]   to that.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:10.760]   I think what happens is that the licenses are actually granted to local stations, like
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.680]   your local ABC or whatever.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   WNBC.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   WNBC.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   Right?
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.280]   And then collectively, they have a lobby called the NAB, or National Association of Broadcasters.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.000]   And this is why they have so much power, is you've got all these local networks, let's
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.720]   call three or four of them in every geography, and they all come together as part of this
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.040]   lobby.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.080]   And so this is why nothing ever changes.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.680]   But does this model still make sense?
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   No.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.520]   I mean, it's completely obsolete.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.640]   But those local networks will all go crazy if they lose their free spectrum.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.240]   Well, they pay for it.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   They don't get it for free.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   They don't pay for it now.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.320]   They get a free license from the FCC in exchange for the fairness requirement and these other
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   requirements.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.240]   I think that they pay billions of dollars for these and hundreds of millions on a local
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   level.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   Not these licenses.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   No.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.640]   Every six years or so, they come back up and they get renewed by the FCC.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.520]   I was just talking about the spectrum auctions.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   I'm looking at it right now.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.520]   That's different.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.520]   Okay.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   All right.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   Interesting.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.520]   No.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.600]   Look, the FCC has auctioned spectrum before, but not the spectrum that the broadcast networks
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.200]   are sitting on, which is some of the most valuable spectrum.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   Got it.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.760]   And the only reason why it's being used this way is because of legacy, because this is
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.320]   how it worked a hundred years ago.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.280]   Well, and then this parallels into, I think, some of the research that's going on right
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.520]   now around legacy media and trust in media.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.600]   A bunch of reports have been coming out about this.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.720]   It's not shocking to anybody who listens to this podcast, but confidence in institutions
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.320]   is tracked by a number of different organizations, Gallup being one of them.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:56.760]   And if we look at how Americans feel and trust has generally been going down in everything,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   the military.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.360]   It's also being tracked in the WAPO op-ed section.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.040]   Are you going to pull that up, Jake, do you have that or no?
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.400]   Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:16.000]   But here, if you take a look at from 2021, 2022, and into 2023, television news went
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:26.840]   from 16 down to 11, and back up to 14, but is amongst the lowest in terms of trust.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   And 40% of Americans have no trust in media at all, according to this Gallup poll.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:40.120]   Here's how it breaks down by party, Republican, Independent, and Democrats.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:48.500]   Democrats by the Democrats, 58%, Independents 29%, Republicans 11%.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:55.900]   In mass media, your thoughts, Friedberg, as we look at just trust in general, in institutions,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.720]   this transitionary period we're in and specifically the media.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.140]   I do think we've talked about this a number of times in the past.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:09.560]   So without rehashing too much, I think that many of the institutions that have offered
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.320]   media have had to move away from providing data and information because data and information
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   has commoditized.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.040]   It's available broadly through the internet and other places.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.340]   So the actual gathering of information is now democratized.
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.600]   You know, agencies put their data on their websites, stock markets are published on the
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   internet.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.880]   So the internet has democratized access to information.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:34.400]   So the media companies that have historically been arbiters of information have had to become
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.360]   effectively content businesses.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.420]   They've had to provide more than just information.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:48.440]   And what has happened is a iterative feedback system whereby the more kind of angry they
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.100]   can make someone, the more upset they can make someone, the more emotive they can make
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:59.140]   a reader or a viewer or a listener, the more clicks they get, the more the kind of limbic
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.680]   system triggers that consumer to come back and consume some more of their media.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.440]   And so the iterative development cycle is that things look like they're one side versus
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.320]   another side in nearly every context, in every piece of media.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.800]   Everyone is opinionated and making a position point from a side, from a perceived side that
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.660]   they are representing because it is emotive to the readers and the readers come back and
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.060]   they align with that side and they want to have more of that because it incites their
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   limbic system.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.060]   So that's what's happened.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.360]   And as a result, when people look at it and assume that it's what it used to be, which
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.080]   is objective truth, fact finding information gathering, and it is not that they're like,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.920]   well, this isn't even news anymore.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.480]   And the truth is, it's not because information is democratized.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.840]   It's available to you anywhere and everywhere you want it.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   You can get it through citizen journalism, via blogs, via podcasts, via Twitter, via
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.060]   many other places.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:54.920]   And so the legacy media companies have effectively become emotive content companies in order
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.480]   to drive clicks, drive views, sell ads.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.840]   That's really all this whole story is.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.480]   And I don't think that that's going to shift.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.200]   I don't think that Jeff Bezos has attempt to try and return WAPO back to being a fact
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.440]   finding organization is going to be successful.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.880]   I think all the consumers that read WAPO today, they love the one sided nature.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.720]   They love the bias that they read.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.200]   It makes them feel good.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.400]   I think that the people that work there love the bias.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.040]   They love writing those opinion pieces.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.520]   It makes them feel good.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.960]   I don't think anyone actually wants boring news anymore.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.280]   Because you know what, they can go to a website from the government itself or from a company
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.520]   itself and just read the information.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.720]   And frankly, if they want to get unbiased, honest, factual information, there's 100 other
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   sources.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.080]   Well, and then here, the commentary, the comment, yeah, the commentary about off the cuff, etc.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.400]   You know what that is?
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.680]   That's called authentic conversation.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.400]   That is how people speak.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.480]   When we all get together, we are not journalists, we are not necessarily well versed.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.920]   Let's be honest, we mess things up a lot.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.960]   We say off the cuff comments that are wrong very often.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.360]   But that's just how people speak.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   And it feels authentic.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.720]   And when we do have signal, I think that listeners and viewers are smart enough to separate that
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.400]   signal from noise.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.080]   And they are going to make their own decisions about what they find to be truth and factual
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.560]   and what they're going to use to make decisions in their life.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.500]   And that's, I think, how people want to consume information now.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.400]   It's not being told what the truth is by some fake authority.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.600]   And here is a clip from the podcast last year.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.120]   Podcasts could play a huge role, just like in 2016, social media broke through and played
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   a huge role.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:31.440]   I think in 2024, I think that podcast could break through and be the way that unorthodox
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.840]   candidates get their message out.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.400]   It could be the way all candidates get their message out.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:42.800]   We're moving from traditional media defining these candidates to direct to consumer, direct
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.280]   through Twitter/X, direct through podcasts, this podcast included.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.680]   What we're witnessing right now is the transition from traditional media and the establishment
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.440]   defining who the great candidates are to the public and the people on podcasts and social
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.320]   media who are the tip of the spear on the vanguard.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.600]   They're going to pick the winners.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.600]   I love you both.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.040]   You guys totally nailed it.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040]   Look at that.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.560]   Sax, your thoughts on this sort of transition?
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.440]   Interestingly, as we know, Rogan had Trump on, over 40 million views now.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.560]   I think they're up to 100 million views now for that Rogan/Trump interview.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:21.040]   Despite the fact that you literally could not find it if you search for it in Google
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   or YouTube.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   Quite amazing.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   Well, we'll get to that in a second.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   Yeah, that's an interesting one.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.560]   I got to take on that, but what do you take from Rogan getting, let's say, many more views
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.240]   than the last two presidential debates?
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.960]   Trump/Harris, 67 million viewers, Trump/Biden, 51 million viewers.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:46.720]   I think maybe Rogan combined with his two episodes will get more than the first two
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   debates.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.920]   Yeah, look, I think this is the first podcast election where you can make the argument that
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   podcasts will decide the election.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.120]   There's a couple of reasons for that.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.600]   One is podcasts have gotten big enough that there's enough audience that they just have
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   the reach now to play a big role.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.320]   Second, the format is highly informative to viewers.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.840]   You get to see a candidate expound in long form, being asked questions and having to
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.640]   go for potentially hours at a time.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:23.200]   Trump went for three hours with Rogan, and it's very hard to hide who you are when you're
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.200]   going for that period of time in an unscripted environment.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:32.640]   I would argue even the hour that Trump spent with us demonstrated that he knew a lot more
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.200]   about policy issues than people were giving him credit for, and it also showed his personality
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.680]   was a lot different than the media had portrayed him.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.600]   So I think that podcasts have been a great advantage for Trump.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.160]   He's been willing to do them, and I think he does them quite well.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:55.520]   I think it's particularly helpful to him in a context where the legacy media has been
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.980]   trying to portray him as a very extreme figure, as literally a Nazi or literally the reincarnation
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.260]   of Adolf Hitler.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:08.000]   When the media is telling the audience that you're that, and then you can go on Rogan
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.480]   for three hours and show that you're a normal, funny guy who actually knows a lot about policy,
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.080]   this is such a different impression than what the media is trying to portray that it's been
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.960]   incredibly, I think, useful and advantageous for Trump.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:27.480]   By the same token, Kamala Harris has not been willing to do Rogan, at least not on Rogan's
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   terms.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.280]   Apparently, she was willing to sit down for one hour with him, but-
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.720]   But not in Austin, according to-
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   But not in Austin.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.420]   What Rogan said is, "No, we have to sit down in our studio for three hours."
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.260]   So far, she hasn't been willing to do that.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:45.920]   I think that speaks volumes in and of itself, is that she hasn't been willing to subject
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.880]   herself to the same sort of, you could call it interrogation or really just long-form
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.080]   conversation that Trump has been willing to.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.960]   But in any event, just I think my bottom line on this is that I think Trump's biggest challenge
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:06.600]   in this election is just to get people comfortable with the idea of a second Trump term, to get
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.000]   people comfortable with him.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.200]   And I think that him going on all these podcasts, including ours, including I thought the Andrew
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.720]   Schultz one was really good too, has helped him, I think, just get people comfortable
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.220]   with the idea of Trump, which I think was just his biggest obstacle in this election.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:26.040]   Because people definitely want to change, and they're not happy with Biden and Harris.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:34.840]   The one thing I'll say is, before you go on Rogan, there's a sense of anxiety that I had,
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   which was, "Do I have enough interesting things to say for three hours?"
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.540]   That was really at the top of my mind.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:49.000]   I think, Jason, I talked to you right before I went on, and that was a big thing for me.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.240]   And then you go and you get in the seat, and he's incredible in the way that he moves the
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.080]   conversation along.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.520]   And then you end up, you're like, "Oh, it's already been three hours."
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.380]   That's his superpower.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:08.800]   The reason that she should find a way to go to Austin and do it is because he has the
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:15.120]   ability to allow you to be your true self over a long period of time.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   And I think, again, just going back to the basics, she deserves for herself, for the
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.720]   American people to vote up or down who she really is.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:31.240]   And all the campaign strategists aside, and all of the other nonsense aside, I would want
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:37.760]   if I was running for president, one shot at people being able to see me for who I really
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   am.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   And that's why she should go on Rogan.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.320]   I think she's afraid of that.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.560]   I mean, she has mostly ducked media interviews and ducked any podcasts that would be perceived
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.800]   as adversarial or not super friendly.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.720]   But she stopped ducking them, I think, in fairness to her, maybe after she was in the
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.120]   third or fourth week, she started doing them.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.200]   Yeah, she's done Call Me Daddy.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   She's done Howard Stern.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.440]   She's done the ones that she knew would be super friendly.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   Yeah, of course.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   Doing adversarial is probably...
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.120]   But don't you think that Trump did our show because he thought it would be friendly?
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.000]   Yeah, he started with friendlies, yeah.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.760]   Yeah, why would he do oppositional?
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   When Trump did...
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.440]   I mean, we were on the first podcast he went on.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:17.440]   Were we the first...
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.440]   Kamala went on that Fox...
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.520]   She went on that Fox News thing.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.840]   She did Fox News for 26 minutes, Friedberg, and her staff was waving.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:27.600]   They were on the sidelines waving frantically to get her off of there.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.080]   But in any event, were we the first podcast to interview Trump?
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   Second.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.600]   The Nelk boys were first.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.720]   I guess we were second.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:43.600]   I think that it was really unclear what would happen when you put a major candidate for
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.240]   president on a podcast for an hour at the time he did it.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.200]   I think he took a little bit of a risk, and I think it worked out for him, and then he's
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.320]   done a lot more since then.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:57.840]   I mean, other than Rogan, Rogan and us have consistently tried to get everybody on all
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.280]   sides to be on the podcast.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.560]   I think we did a really good job looking back on...
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.000]   We've gotten everybody except one person, Kamala Harris.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.960]   I mean, I wish I had time to have asked him about...
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   We had all the Dems.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   ...January 6th.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.960]   We had all the senior Dems.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   That was the only thing I didn't get to on my questions.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:16.120]   We had all the independents, and we had all the credible Republicans.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   And to his credit.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   By the elections.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   We were the first for RFK, right?
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   We were the first for RFK.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   Yeah, he credits us.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   First for Dean Phillips.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   Dean Phillips.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   And Vivek.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   First for Vivek.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.880]   I think we were the first for Vivek, and so, yeah, I give us some credit there.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.860]   On the search issue, I looked into that, there, Vivek, sorry, I always get that wrong.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:40.880]   The search issue, there was some complaints that YouTube might have been, like, I don't
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.960]   know, hiding the video, which didn't make much sense to people, so I did an investigation
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.600]   of that, Sax.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   You're laughing.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   Go ahead.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.880]   Well, finish what you're saying.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   No, no, no, go ahead.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.320]   I have a different point of view than you on this, but.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   I didn't even get my point of view.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.720]   I know, I've seen it on Twitter, but keep going.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.200]   Oh, well, no, I did a search on Bing.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   You're gonna defend Google, I know.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.560]   No, no, I'm not defending Google.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.480]   I'm just explaining to people how search works, independent of it.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:13.760]   I went to Bing, DuckDuckGo, search.brave.com, Google, YouTube, Google Video, and what people
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.800]   don't understand about how the search algorithms work is they are designed to increase advertising
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:25.740]   dollars, and Freeberg will back me up this, he worked at Google, and session length.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   That's the goal.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:31.640]   Am I correct, Freeberg, with algorithms, whether it's TikTok, YouTubes, et cetera?
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.200]   Yeah, I'm not gonna-- Increase session time and increase revenue.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.280]   I know more about search results, I don't know as much about the video stuff, so.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:43.560]   So when you look at that, it's a very nuanced thing, but Joe Rogan doesn't monetize his
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.560]   search.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:51.440]   It does not make any money for them, and then clips do make money for YouTube, and the clips
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.000]   have flooded the zone.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.800]   So if you do a search on any search engine, whether it's Bing, or Brave, or DuckDuckGo,
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:05.580]   Google, or YouTube, any of them, what you'll find is the clips beat out the main episodes
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.580]   all the time.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.880]   This happens to our podcast.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:13.360]   When people clip our podcast, they will do keyword stuffing, and they'll beat us, and
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.960]   we'll beat the algorithm, because the algorithm wants to get ads, and we don't have ads turned
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   on either.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.400]   So people have this frequent frustration with This Week in Startups, my other podcast, All
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:28.360]   In Here, and Joe Rogan, that anything that's not monetized on YouTube doesn't rank high.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:34.240]   And if you look, all of the clips, and this makes sense, if you just think logically,
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:40.260]   the clips will generate more engagement, because you get to watch the highlights.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.680]   So it's kind of like sports highlights.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.760]   Sacks, would you like to conspiracy theory this and tell us that Sergey is sandbagging
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.360]   for the Democrats or something by hiding the YouTube video?
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.360]   Well, I don't think it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:56.520]   I mean, if you go to Google every single day and just type in a Trump-related search term
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.200]   versus a Kamala-related search term, you'll see the difference in coverage.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.160]   But back to the Rogan thing, look, Google is a search engine.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.180]   This is what they're supposed to be good at.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:10.800]   You have an interview between the biggest podcaster in the world and a former president
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.040]   who's probably the most famous person in the world.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.440]   It's massively trending.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.360]   It's got something like 100 million views.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.240]   At the time that people noticed that you couldn't find it on YouTube, it already had something
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.380]   like 34 million views.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:27.320]   What I'm saying is, you have to work pretty hard as a search engine for your algorithm
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.840]   to be so bad that you can't find that interview.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.680]   When I went to YouTube and tried to find it, first I typed in Trump-Rogan interview, couldn't
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.680]   find it.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:41.440]   Second, I typed Trump-Rogan interview podcast, couldn't find it, it was just collapsed.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.920]   It was Trump-Rogan full interview, full podcast, still couldn't find it.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.720]   There's no question that this is a factual matter.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.400]   This episode was suppressed in YouTube search.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.080]   If you went to the main Google search engine and did a similar search, what you would have
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:03.640]   found as the number one search result was an article from the Arizona Republic, which
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.960]   is a publication I've never even heard of, that would have told you that the Rogan interview
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.280]   with Trump was a brain-rotted waste of three hours.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.520]   That's the number one result.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:18.520]   Somehow Google decides that its number one result for the Rogan interview was this Arizona
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.680]   Republic story.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.360]   That is not a search engine doing its job.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:31.320]   It's pretty obvious to me that they're using other factors in deciding what to surface
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:38.080]   here, and somehow the results end up being almost universally negative towards Trump
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.760]   and almost universally positive towards Kamala.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.440]   I think you've got to, at this point, have your head buried really deep in the sand not
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.520]   to think that Google is incredibly biased in this election against Trump.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:55.240]   So, let me pull up some facts to show how wrong you are.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.360]   If you pull up YouTube here, here's an image of the YouTube search results that I just
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:06.240]   did for the Trump Rogan, and what you'll see is, as I explained previously, clips perform
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.140]   better and make money.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.840]   They make money, so the algorithm favors those, and what you'll see here is Fox News, et cetera,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.680]   and all these clips, and then eventually you get to the Joe Rogan interview.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.600]   If you look at Bing search results for Rogan Trump interview, what you'll see is all the
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   search engines put news up first, then they go to organic, so it's just a fundamental
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.920]   misunderstanding of how search is designed for users.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:34.280]   They start with news on every search engine today, and then here's Google's same thing,
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:39.860]   and then what you'll see here is, on the Google and on the Bing images, you have a collection,
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:44.000]   you know, typically five or six news stories, then they go to the first organic, so people
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.840]   just don't understand how search works.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.320]   It's always news first when you type in a politician's name, and then when you look
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.440]   at the news, it has New York Post right-leaning.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.880]   You have people who are dead center like AP in there, and you have Fox News there in the
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880]   Google one.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:04.720]   Of the first five, two of them are right-leaning, and AP is obviously in the middle, Forbes,
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.040]   I don't know, maybe Forbes is right-leaning too, Freeberg, over to you.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.600]   Well, I was going to say, I read somewhere, so I have no direct knowledge about this,
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.840]   I actually pinged several people at Google to ask them what was going on, and I did not
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:23.960]   get a clear response, so like I have no insight as to what actually happened, but what I read
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:30.120]   online somewhere was that someone reported that someone at Google said that there was
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:35.720]   kind of a whole bunch of people that clicked inappropriate content flagging on the video,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:41.360]   so like anti-Trump people went to the video, clicked that it was inappropriate, and when
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.560]   YouTube gets that many people clicking that this is inappropriate, it automatically flags
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.560]   it.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   Mass flagging, yes.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.200]   It is a technique people will use, they've used it on our program here, where they flag
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   it.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.040]   They flag it and then people that say at once like, "Hey, there's inappropriate content
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.040]   in here."
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:03.600]   The default is to hide the video from search results while it's investigated, but clearly
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.240]   there's something messed up here because they should have been on top of that and responded
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   immediately with a video that has such a large number of views and such a large audience
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.120]   to allow that to happen and drag on for so long, but someone said that that may have
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.240]   been what happened and then they fixed it, so I don't know, but I just want to point
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.400]   that out, that it may not necessarily have been overt action by Google, but just the
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.880]   way that the system is set up that anyone can flag and if enough people flag, you get
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   the sort of trigger.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:36.520]   I can tell you, I know firsthand that Google is aware of the claims of bias and I think
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.120]   you're starting to see it, just like CNN is aware of the claims of bias and they added
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   …
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   Totally.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.120]   CNN is aware of the claims of bias.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   They're super sensitive.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120]   All these companies are super sensitive to it.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   They're so is Facebook.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.080]   Mark Zuckerberg's very sensitive to it.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.440]   I know Sundar himself is very sensitive to it.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.120]   I don't want to kind of hide the fact that these people think that they're going out
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.600]   and being biased, that they have these kind of information empires because they know that
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   they're going to lose trust and they're going to lose customers and revenue and etc.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.720]   CNN has done, I think, an exceptional job.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.840]   I don't know if you watch it at all, Sax, but they have been having Trump supporters
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.520]   and right-wing commentators in CNN on the desk every …
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.520]   They have?
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.520]   Yes.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.320]   It's really changed the nature of it from being like MSNBC or Fox …
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   Did you know that, Sax?
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.320]   To being something in the middle.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   I didn't know that.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.460]   I've never … I never watch these shows, but like …
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.240]   Before we go off on this topic, people throughout this election have been posting Google search
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.760]   results when you just type in Trump versus Harris, and I've done it.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.560]   Every single time it's massively biased.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.160]   I mean, let's just go through them.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.080]   This was a search result I got months ago where I just typed in Donald Trump and the
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.720]   first carousel was about Kamala Harris.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.000]   I remember joking on the pod that if you want to find the latest news about Kamala Harris,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.560]   just search for Donald Trump.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.580]   And then you go down and the first carousel that's about Trump is negative stories.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.760]   This one was about Project 2025, which has nothing to do with Trump.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.440]   Nonetheless, this was a major Democratic talking point at the time is that somehow that Project
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.720]   2025 is what Trump would do in a second term.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.320]   I just did this and it's different now, obviously.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.400]   You said this is a few months old?
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.840]   I've been doing this on a recurring basis over the last few months.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:20.080]   The point is that whenever you search for the candidates, the news is very positive
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.500]   towards Harris and it's very negative towards Trump.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.320]   And even when you search for Trump, they'll give you positive news about Harris.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.080]   Now go to the podcast … And again, Sax, you don't think this is a
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.080]   function of the fact that so many media outlets are being so negative about Trump and positive
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.520]   about Harris, and so therefore the ratio is just off the media?
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.960]   How does the Arizona Republic end up being the first choice when you search for Rogan
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   Trump?
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.800]   They're not … PageRank can't explain that.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.120]   They're just not a major publication.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.480]   They're not being linked to by a lot of people.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   Doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.480]   Here's another example.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480]   Okay.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.560]   Stay on this one for a second.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.960]   This was after Trump went on the Andrew Schultz podcast.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.480]   That podcast was a very positive experience for him, as we just talked about, helped his
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.040]   campaign a lot.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.640]   What's the number one result when you look for that?
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.200]   New Republic, podcast host laughing Trump face as he struggles to defend rambling.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.280]   That's when he had that hilarious story about the weave.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:18.240]   If you actually watch the clip, the podcast hosts, they were definitely laughing with
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.240]   him.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   They were not laughing at him.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.360]   That was a ridiculous mischaracterization.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.840]   The New Republic is not the objective source for anything.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:32.000]   I don't know how you could say that objectively PageRank should get you to the New Republic
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.680]   as the number one source for the Andrew Schultz interview of Trump.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.680]   That is bias.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.400]   I mean, it's just bias.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:47.160]   There's been so many examples of Google giving these ridiculous results and they find obscure
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.480]   publications and obscure articles that have no basis in the truth to elevate to the top.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.560]   It's almost like they're trying to find the most negative article they can find on Trump
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.440]   and make that the number one result.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.600]   It's not the search engine.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.840]   It's just the corpus of media that's being indexed.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.360]   If you look here at Google-
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.000]   Why isn't it New York Times then?
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.160]   That's the number one thing.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:15.720]   Well, I mean, just here, if you look at Donald Trump, if we were to look at these news sources,
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.960]   there's NBC, NPR, Politico, and New York Times are left-leaning.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.840]   If you were to do this on, I think I have Bing as the next one you can open and you
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.600]   can look at the next one, Nick, which is DuckDuckGo.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.880]   In all of these cases, the problem is only three or 4% of journalists at publications
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.580]   today are right-leaning, and most of the right-leaning publications are opinion publications like
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:45.140]   Fox, et cetera, and so you don't have a lot of representation in the index of Republicans.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.500]   And that's a big opportunity, I think, for Republicans is to make more publications or
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.840]   take more publications over, like we're seeing with the LA Times and Washington Post, which
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840]   I think are going to move right-
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.120]   Publications if Google would choose to surface them, but it decides that it doesn't want
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.120]   to.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.720]   It's on a percentage basis, it's very small is the problem.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   Here you go.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.880]   This is Arizona Republic rocketing to the top of search results for Joe Rogan Trump
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   interview.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.040]   That's a publication that is local to Arizona, that no one's ever heard of, it has no basis
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.400]   being the number one result in Google.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.400]   New York Times is second.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.040]   Okay, I can see the logic of that because New York Times is a big publication.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.440]   Then you go down one row to the carousel, oh, there's New York Public again.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.440]   Why?
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.600]   Because it's calling Trump appearing on Joe Rogan shady.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.040]   And then you've got another one, you've got another one there from the Independent calling
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   Trump a predator.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   I mean, come on.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.040]   This is ridiculous.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.160]   Okay, so you've shared these examples.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.200]   What I would recommend is I think we get someone from Google on the show, we could arrange
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.040]   that and they can kind of talk about how the algorithm works, because I don't think any
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.440]   of us are going to be able to provide a reasonable counterpoint or understanding of what's going
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   on.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:56.320]   But if there is bias, and there's some kind of manual intervention in this, in this process,
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.080]   maybe it can be kind of discussed and talked about why and how and, you know, what the
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.960]   automation is that causes this to happen.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.840]   And let's just try and let's try and let's try and I'll take that as a to do and I'll
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.960]   try and find someone that we can talk to listen, the conversation they do I look, I mean, I've
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.840]   talked with a lot of people over there.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:17.260]   And I have heard from a lot of folks that this is a real issue that folks are trying
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.320]   to address internally, so that there's this perception of bias that they're trying to
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.520]   get rid of.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.760]   And they really want to address it.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.080]   This is what I've heard from people at Google.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.960]   So I want to give them a chance to pull up the thing rather than having us all debated
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.600]   or I don't even have a strong point of view on this, I'd rather just bring someone in
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   and talk about it.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.320]   So just as a counterpoint here, Nick, pull up the thing I just did for Donald Trump.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.560]   And we'll just if you do it as an exercise, that's always the way to find the objective
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.320]   truth here is to try the independent search engines or other search engines, DuckDuckGo
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320]   brave, perplexing.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.320]   perplexing.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   Well, yeah, you can do that as well.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320]   We'll see.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.080]   But if you look here, this being one, if you take out MSN, well, no, if you go MSN woke
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:59.520]   woke search.com, check out MSN, USA Today, Charlotte Observer, Seattle Times, Washington
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.960]   Post, I think these are all left leaning.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:10.080]   So that is more to my point that the entire corpus of news reportage is 95% left leaning.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.760]   That's what's happening here.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.000]   And so they need to they're going to need to manually sacks, say these 5% should get
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.240]   represented 5050.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.720]   In the search results to please the other side, even though that's not what the corpus
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.720]   is.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.240]   And the number of stories written by left leaning just is probably 50 to one to right
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   leaning.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240]   Moving on
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   through I have an alternate explanation.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   We just got this.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   This just got some data.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.720]   I'd like to just pull up this data if I could look at employee donations to party.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.120]   We've looked at tech companies.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.800]   It's all 90 something percent goes to Democrats separate very simple explanation for why the
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:56.640]   Google search results are horribly biased in one direction, Uber's 18%.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.640]   All right.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.320]   Let's go to our final segment here.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.560]   We'll talk a little bit about the election.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560]   Why don't you tee us up here?
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.560]   Freeberg.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:12.720]   All right, guys, I'll quickly introduce our final political election update before our
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:21.120]   live stream on Tuesday, obviously, a lot of daily freakouts, daily efforts at having an
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.240]   October surprise that will take down the other side, all sorts of drama, all sorts of insult,
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.840]   not a lot of love in America right now.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.320]   Super depressing and sad.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.640]   All sorts of stuff happened this week.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.480]   J. Cal, once you kick us off, what do you think is going to happen on Tuesday?
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.040]   What are the things that you think are going to move people between now and then?
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   It's a toss up.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   I mean, that's what everybody's saying.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.760]   It looks like Trump's got a slight lead.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.960]   So I think it's going to be a toss up.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   Sachs.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.960]   Agreed.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:53.340]   Are we 65, 35 as Polly Market predicts or are we 100% Trump or we 90% Kamala Harris?
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.340]   What are we looking at?
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.440]   Well, you definitely can't say it's going to be 100% anyone.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.380]   I mean, but if again, if you look at all the data, the data is definitely pointing towards
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.760]   Trump having an advantage.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.520]   Obviously, the prediction markets are almost two to one in favor of Trump.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.000]   The polling shows that Trump is ahead narrowly in all the swing states.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.640]   I think every single one of them, even the sort of blue wall states of Pennsylvania,
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:22.720]   Michigan, Wisconsin, that Harris must win, I think, in order to have a path to victory.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.200]   Whereas Michigan and Wisconsin are very, very close, like 1% or less in the swing state
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:33.720]   polls, Pennsylvania polling shows that Trump is ahead by, I think, two or three.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.060]   That's what I've seen today.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.840]   So it is looking good for Trump.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:43.520]   And if you look at the numbers that Elon's group, that America PAC put out, it looks
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:53.080]   like the early voting in Pennsylvania is trending 500,000 votes better for Republicans in the
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.320]   early voting than four years ago.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320]   So it sucks.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320]   Is that just pulling votes forward?
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.320]   It could be.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.320]   It could be.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   It could be.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.280]   Instead of showing up at the ballot box on Tuesday, a lot of folks are doing mail-ins
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.080]   and making sure they get their vote in in mail instead of going in person.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.880]   So then you've got to look at polling of people who say they're going to vote but haven't
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.040]   voted yet in Pennsylvania, who say they're going to vote on election day.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:21.480]   And I think those numbers are running about 18 points ahead for Trump, which is about
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.240]   double what he needs to win.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.600]   So just to be clear, the early voting favors Harris, but not by the same percentages that
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.360]   it did four years ago.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:36.440]   So right now, it looks like Trump is tracking to win that state.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.960]   But look, I can't guarantee it.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.800]   I'm not representing that.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.800]   That's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.240]   But right now, the numbers are looking good.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.320]   Remember, Biden only won Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.760]   And again, the swing so far is Republicans are doing 500,000 votes better than they were
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.360]   doing four years ago.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.880]   So there's a lot of stories coming out on Twitter, on independent media, and on mainstream
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.320]   media, or legacy media, as we might call it now, talking about, "Hey, I live in a house.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.280]   I got 15 ballots mailed to me," all with different random names.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.480]   And these sort of anecdotal stories are being pushed and then amplified by folks that are
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.160]   involved in the election.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.120]   Chamath, is this kind of dangerous?
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.560]   Do we think that there really is a lot of this kind of election meddling happening?
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.320]   And if not, or if there is, is this kind of a dangerous thing to happen, where a lot of
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.960]   people are talking about this, where no matter what happens on Tuesday, people start to question
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.880]   the results of the election?
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.280]   How much should we be kind of worried about this rhetoric?
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.640]   I think there are two things.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.960]   There's the substance, and then there's the strategy.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.080]   The substance is that, does it really make sense that the most advanced and important
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:53.920]   country in the world doesn't have a uniform system where one ballot is given to every
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:00.560]   single American citizen who is eligible to vote?
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.840]   That probably makes sense, so we should probably just figure out how to do that.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.680]   Separately, the strategy of it is for both sides to lay the groundwork to say that this
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.200]   thing somehow wasn't totally right down the middle.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.400]   I am hoping for a very clear, decisive victory.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   And frankly, whichever candidate wins, I hope that it's very clear and decisive so that
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.760]   everybody is forced to de-escalate and move on.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:41.280]   Now, that said, I think what the early voting data shows is something that you haven't seen
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:50.160]   in the past, which is that there are a lot of Republican people that are voting early.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.720]   I don't know what that means for Election Day, but typically it's the Democrats that
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:13:00.800]   dominate these early voting processes, and they build what's called the firewall.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.480]   And in these swing states, these firewalls become very important going into Election
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.480]   Day.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:12.040]   And as Zach said, a bunch of these states are different than they've historically been
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.040]   in the favor of the Republicans.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:21.440]   I saw an article today that just said that they've basically considered Nevada now in
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.240]   the Republican camp, because there's been so much early voting that it's about 60% of
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.520]   the total votes they think have already been cast, since they have a very clear Republican
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.060]   lead going into Election Day.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.720]   So there's all kinds of stuff here that's new.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.640]   I just hope that it's just an absolutely crushing victory in one direction or the other, so
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:45.080]   that we de-escalate and get on to the business of running the country.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.360]   So I'm going to break with most of my Republican brethren on this and say, I think early voting
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.080]   is actually a good thing.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   It's very convenient.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080]   Right?
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.520]   You don't have to force people to only vote on just one day, because what if you get sick
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.280]   or a kid gets sick and you have to pick them up from school?
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.840]   There's a lot of things that can go wrong.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.720]   It is more convenient to have, say, two or three weeks to be able to cast your vote.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.900]   I actually think that's not a bad thing.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.080]   And in terms of who it helps, I'm not sure.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.200]   But I think that as Republicans become more of a populist party and the Democrats become
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:21.120]   more of an elitist party, I think higher turnout might actually...might benefit Republicans
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.120]   regardless.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.800]   So I think it's a huge convenience for voters, and I think early voting is something that
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.440]   we should keep.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.080]   The thing we got to change is in the states where you don't have to present any voter
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.920]   ID to show who you are, that's just crazy.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.040]   I mean, you just...you go up to the polling place and you give your name and I guess your
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.360]   address, and they look you up on a computer and they hand you a ballot, and there's no
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.320]   verification that you are who you say you are.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.520]   That to me is crazy.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.520]   The other thing that's crazy is that you can even get registered and added to the voter
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.520]   rolls in a lot of states without any proof of citizenship.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:15:00.800]   So there are states where you can go get a driver's license without proof of citizenship,
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   and there's just a checkbox to be added to the voter rolls, and no one ever checks you're
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.480]   a citizen, and now you're on the voter roll and you can go pick up your ballot without
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.920]   any voter ID.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   That's just crazy to me.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:18.080]   So I think that after this election, there should be some sort of bill that gets passed
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:24.280]   and signed by the president that sets a minimum standard for voter integrity.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   And I...
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.280]   For federal election.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.280]   For federal election.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.280]   For federal elections, right.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.280]   Because states can do what they want, right?
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280]   Like each state can vote how they want.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.640]   I guess states can do what they want, but I don't think states should be able to do
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.320]   whatever they want in federal elections because that affects all of us.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:39.960]   I want to point out that each state is effectively voting for the folks that they want to have
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.640]   go to the electoral college, and that's really where the vote for president is cast.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640]   So should there be...
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   Yeah, but that affects all of us.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.360]   I mean, if there's cheating in several states and in a close election, by the way, I'm not
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.160]   accusing that of happening, okay?
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.640]   I'm just saying that if we have several states that don't have basic voter integrity, and
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.460]   that affects the outcome of a national election, that has a huge impact on all of us.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.040]   Let's just talk about this really important point, which I think a lot of folks ignore.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.360]   It's not a direct democracy.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.400]   It's not like everyone in the United States votes for the president.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.120]   What happens is the states send a bunch of electors to go vote for the president.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.400]   Each state casts a vote for the president.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.680]   How each state ultimately decides who they're going to vote for for president is through
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.240]   this kind of process that we've kind of standardized across the states, but each state is making
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.240]   a vote.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.940]   So shouldn't the states be able to kind of decide how they want to make their kind of
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.800]   voting process run internally to determine who the folks are that are going to go to
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800]   the electoral college?
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.600]   I mean, I think the constitution specifies that the states will run their own elections,
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.760]   and I'm fine with that, but what I'm saying is there needs to be a minimum standard.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   To me, the minimum standard is voter ID and proof of citizenship to get registered.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.760]   I'm in strong agreement with Sachs on this front, and I've actually done a ton of research
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.440]   into it that I would like to share, because I think this is an important service we can
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.280]   do here on the All In podcast, I think.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.280]   I had Hans...
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.680]   So as a diehard moderate, you agree with Sachs?
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:17.160]   I mean, as an American, putting political parties aside, I had Hans von Spakovsky of
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.440]   the Heritage Foundation on This Week in Startups last Tuesday, you can watch it, and they have
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:29.320]   spent a ton of money and time on election fraud, and obviously they're a partisan organization.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.320]   They found 1,600 cases in 40 years, it's about 40 a year.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.920]   They found 23 cases in 2020, none of them were in Georgia.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.960]   You can go search those cases, and you'll find cases like this one here that Nick will
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.400]   pull up, Randy Allen Jumper, who voted twice, and the database is amazing.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.360]   They're crowdsourcing this, and so putting all partisan aside, the Heritage Foundation
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.320]   is doing great work here because sunlight is the best disinfectant, and what's really
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:05.680]   important for Americans to understand is it is impossible right now, absolutely statistically
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:11.760]   impossible to swing the presidential election with fraud.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.920]   The Brennan Center, they're on the other side, they did a report about voter fraud, and they
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:25.600]   put it at 0.0003% and 0.0025%, and basically you've got a much greater chance of being
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.920]   struck by lightning.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.840]   And let's just do a little bit of math here, 158 million people voted in 2020, we'll have
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:38.400]   about 160 million this year, if the estimates are correct, and if you look at swing states,
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.180]   right, that's where I think a lot of people are concerned, "Oh, what if they could swing
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.180]   it in Georgia?"
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.180]   Right?
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:49.200]   And we all know from the famous phone call to Brad Raffensperger, who's a Republican,
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.480]   Secretary of State, and Trump said, "Hey, you know, we've got to find these 11,780 votes,"
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.800]   that was the winning margin.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.560]   So if we were to talk about that, right, and we compare it to what the Heritage Foundation
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.360]   found, 1,600 cases documented in 40 years, about 40 a year.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:14.520]   Now there could be a multiple of that, Freiburg, 10 times, 100 times, but to find 11,000 ballots,
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.280]   this would require, in Georgia, for, which has voter ID, and by the way, voter ID is
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:26.340]   in 35 of 50 states already, after this election, it's going to hit 40, because it's just obvious
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.320]   that we all want that.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.520]   Georgia requires you to have ID to vote in person, and you have to water, and they've
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.340]   watermarked the ballots.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:42.360]   So in order, Shamoff, for somebody to do this, they would have to fake 12,000 watermarked
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:48.200]   ballots and have fake IDs, and have those 12,000 people not show up to vote and have
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200]   two votes there.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   Then, if you were to-
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.180]   Well, it looks like Georgia's got a great system, but we're talking about the states
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.180]   that don't.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.320]   Like in California, they just passed a law saying that you're not allowed to look at
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320]   voter ID.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.560]   Right, and so that obviously should change, but the point is, even in California, which
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.560]   we know is-
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.960]   Sorry, California did that?
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.440]   Why do you guys think such a law is passed?
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.960]   What's the justification for that?
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:18.000]   They want to not have somebody who had a chance to vote vote, and it obviously benefits Democrats,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.440]   if you believe that minorities don't have ID in some greater population, which people
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:30.400]   have rightly called out is racist, and there is this concept that black people or Hispanic
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.320]   people might not have IDs to the same extent, and they would lean Democrat.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.880]   That is the cynical approach that people have taken.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:45.320]   But if we look at this, it is impossible, impossible to swing the federal election-
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   Wait, wait, don't skip over this.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.680]   Sorry, Jason, you're saying it's a DEI thing?
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.680]   That's what people claim.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:50.720]   I'm not saying I claim that.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.840]   And I think that's condescending and nonsense to act like minorities don't have a driver's
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.840]   license.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.840]   It's ridiculous.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.840]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.840]   Or some other form of ID.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.840]   I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:05.480]   To answer your question, Chamath, I don't think there is a good justification for rejecting
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.680]   voter ID, and the law is even worse than that, because it literally makes it illegal for
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.160]   someone to ask.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.400]   So if you go to a polling place in California, they can't look at your ID.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.000]   Even if you say, "Well, I lost my ballot," or something, they just have to take your
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.440]   word for it when they give you a new ballot.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.560]   There's a legal requirement for every employer, when you hire somebody, to make sure that
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:29.240]   that person is eligible to work in the United States, if you're going to pay them legally,
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.240]   right?
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.720]   You get an I-9, and they need to justify that they have a social security number.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:40.920]   That typically tells you whether you need a supplemental work authorization or not.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:49.680]   So if you do that for normal, functional employment, why wouldn't you do it for voting as well?
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   Of course.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   You need an ID to get on a plane.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.720]   You need an ID to buy a beer.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.640]   You need an ID to do all sorts of things in our society.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.940]   So it's ludicrous.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.720]   Voting is something where you should need an ID, because you have to match up that the
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.520]   person who's standing in front of you at the ballot box is the person on the voter rolls.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:15.760]   But why is it more important to make sure that the person sitting in 23B on the United
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:22.040]   Flight is who he says it is, but it's less important for someone to just walk in off
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.000]   the street and vote for the President of the United States?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.140]   Why is that?
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:32.720]   Because people believe that certain communities may not have ID, and then they would be not
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.300]   given the right to vote.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:38.680]   Why don't you allow people to just get on an airplane and just fly wherever they want?
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.480]   Yeah, or drive without a driver's license.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480]   I mean, I'm not saying I agree with that.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.800]   It's just, I'm telling you what people have said is the reason.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.400]   I think it's cover.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.840]   I think that's total nonsense.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.680]   I think it's actually, if you think about it, it's insulting to minority groups to imply
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.400]   that they're incapable of getting a voter ID.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.680]   When you say people, you're saying people in charge?
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.600]   The people in charge of California, this is what they think?
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.600]   Yes.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.600]   And it turns out...
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600]   It's not what they think.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.160]   They're trying to enable cheating.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.920]   We haven't had a voter ID.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.280]   They wanted, not every state has government ID that isn't a driver's license.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.280]   Is this Gavin Newsom?
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.280]   Right.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.280]   So this is Gavin Newsom.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:27.040]   It's obvious to see what the effect of this is going to be, which is it makes it easier
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.560]   to engage in cheating.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:33.880]   Do you guys think if Gavin Newsom was on an airplane, and we said, "Half these people
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   here have just bought a ticket, but we didn't check their IDs," would he get off the plane
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.880]   or stay on the plane?
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.880]   Do you think?
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.640]   I think TSA requires IDs so that they can do a check on everyone, make sure that they're
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.320]   not on a do not fly list and all that sort of stuff.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.400]   There's consensus that everybody wants voter ID.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.520]   I think you can kind of think about a, there's a do not fly list, and there should be a do
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.520]   not vote list.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.000]   Like, if you're not a citizen, you should be on the do not vote list, meaning you have
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.160]   to be on the I can vote list in order to vote.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.840]   It seems pretty reasonable.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.840]   The fact that we've got a lot of federal agencies checking IDs to determine whether you can
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   or can't do something.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.120]   I think there is no way to swing the election, even if there is a moderate amount.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.080]   That is the most important for people to take out.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   So you're not worried about election fraud.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   Partisan election fraud.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]   I don't know how you can draw that conclusion.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.740]   If people can cheat, then you can swing an election.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:26.240]   You can draw it statistically based upon what I've just said, which is the smallest race
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.160]   is 11,779.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.640]   Remember when Trump asked them to find those votes?
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.680]   Do you remember that?
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.560]   We're talking about the state of Georgia, which I think actually has integrity.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.920]   We're talking about the state of California here.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.720]   That's the closest race just passed.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:51.200]   Just in your mind, in your mind, logically think about what it would take to get 11,779
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.320]   people to fraudulently do that, and that they would go to jail and it'd be a felony.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.160]   So this is that hard to me.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.320]   I'm just saying like, how would you do 11,000 votes or whatever doesn't seem that hard if
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.320]   there's no voter ID?
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.320]   It's not possible.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.240]   Where would you get 11,000 ballots?
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.240]   Maybe not in Georgia, because they actually have voter integrity.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240]   Even in California.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240]   Where would you get 11,000 ballots?
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.240]   Hold on a second.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.280]   California is a huge state.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.520]   They allow ballot harvesting and they've eliminated voter ID.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.400]   So you're telling me that's impossible for someone to cheat?
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.400]   Nothing's impossible.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.400]   No, no.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.280]   Cheating, we all agree cheating exists.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.280]   Like credit fraud, fraud exists.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:34.160]   What I'm saying is it's so manageable that is farcical for anybody to think that we could
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:41.120]   swing the presidential election because Trump tried to swing the presidential election by
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.080]   asking to find 11,000 and he filed 58 lawsuits and lost all of them.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.520]   It's not possible for you.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520]   Do you think so?
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.900]   Then what is the value then of having voter ID, Jason, if the cheating is so hard?
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:57.640]   Because it would add more trust to the system and it's always virtuous to add more trust.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:03.080]   I think they should also give you a receipt when you vote to make sure there's no shenanigans.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.240]   And we want to build as much trust in the system as possible.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.240]   But the point here-
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.720]   I would give you a receipt to reduce fraud?
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:15.440]   It would reduce people believing that their vote was changed after they left the box.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:20.720]   So if we all had a receipt, and then there was some debate in a small area because of,
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.360]   you know, hanging chads like in Florida, everybody would have their receipt.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.000]   And if you remember the hanging chads case, there were people who said, I voted for Gore,
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.380]   I voted for Bush, and my vote got counted wrong.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:35.840]   People don't remember this, but you had to push through a card and it popped a chad out
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.640]   of a little circle.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.480]   And there are people who did it wrong because the instructions were, you know, it's a physical
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   thing.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.480]   You have to punch a hole into it.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.960]   I don't know who came up with that system as opposed to drawing a circle.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.640]   But that was 24 years ago.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.040]   I'm sure that's changed by now.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.280]   There was a guy named Chad.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.160]   But no, now they are giving receipts to people.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:00.040]   So the gold standard is giving a receipt showing ID and having multiple weeks to do it.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.600]   And so if anybody's taking anything away from this, there can be cheating, but it cannot
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.600]   swing the president.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.760]   Okay, so Jason's going in, can I make a point?
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.000]   So you mentioned, I think, fraud rates, credit card fraud rates, didn't you?
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.440]   I think that's one of the things you mentioned.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:20.320]   Well, the same way, we don't worry about credit card fraud, because there's a certain tiny
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.560]   amount of it in the system.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.320]   But in this case, it would be a magnitude more than voter fraud.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:33.600]   Voter fraud is extremely rare, because there's no incentive to cheat that would be worth
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.400]   going to jail for.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.700]   And that's why people generally don't cheat in these elections, because the cost is so
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:40.700]   great.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.200]   I was the COO of a payments company.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.320]   So let me, oh, actually, sorry, that was Saks, sorry, go ahead, Saks.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.440]   Let me explain how this actually works, since I was founding COO of PayPal.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.800]   To be clear, one in a million chance of credit card fraud, can I just explain this to the
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800]   audience?
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.800]   Sure.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.520]   Okay, you can create all the models you want.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.160]   And you can create an expectation of future fraud based on the prior fraud rates.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.620]   However, if you change your verification standards, that data is no longer relevant.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:13.960]   If you create a loophole big enough for a fraudster to drive a truck through, then if
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.280]   a fraudster figures that out, you could have infinite amounts of fraud.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.920]   In other words, the historical fraud rate may not be predictive of future fraud if you
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.480]   change the verification standards.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:31.080]   And I would say that the state of California, signing a bill that prohibits voter ID might
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.680]   be such a loophole.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.040]   So I don't see how you can say with this kind of certainty and confidence that you're saying
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.800]   that no fraud could ever swing an election.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.960]   Of course, fraud could swing an election.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.580]   It could swing the presidential election.
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:46.480]   It could swing a tiny election in a state or in a local place.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.480]   Of course it could because there's a very small number.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.640]   Well, I'm not really interested in finding out.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   What I believe is that there are some-
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.640]   Yeah, no, I'm just talking about logic.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   There are some verification-
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.720]   How would you do 11,000 is the question.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   It would be incredibly difficult to do 11,000.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.920]   Trump tried to swing 11,000.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.320]   If you create a big enough loophole, it doesn't sound that hard to me.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.720]   It just doesn't matter common sense.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.120]   I don't think you can say that something is impossible.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.080]   What we should do is simply tighten up these requirements.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.080]   There's no excuse-
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.080]   We're in agreement about that.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.080]   I'm just talking about in this election-
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.080]   There's no excuse for a state banning voter ID.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.080]   So-
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.080]   In this election, you don't have to worry.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.600]   35 out of 50 states-
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.360]   So, I hope that starting in January, we pass a national voter ID law that's the minimum
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.360]   standard for states.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   100%.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.360]   We all agree on that.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   100%.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.360]   We all agree on that.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   Yes.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.720]   I'm just saying in this election, practically 35 out of 50 states have voter ID and the
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.640]   ones that don't, the closest margin is 11,700.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   This time next week-
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.640]   It's not going to happen.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   We'll see if it-
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   We'll be able to talk about the results.
