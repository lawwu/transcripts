[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   For our next panel, we are going to have a quick introduction to each of the three
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.200]   electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle companies, the eVTOL companies.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.360]   We'll see a video for introducing Joby, and then Adam from Archer is going to introduce Archer,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.320]   and then Brian from Wyss, and then we're going to have a conversation. I'll be back in a minute.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   [Music]
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:40.320]   [Music]
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   [Music]
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   [Music]
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   [Music]
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   [Music]
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:42.320]   [Music]
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:54.320]   [Music]
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   [Music]
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.320]   I founded Archer in 2018 to change the way the world moves.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   Urban congestion isn't sustainable.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   This leaves the average American stuck in traffic for dozens of hours per year.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   To combat that challenge, we built Midnight.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   [Music]
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   An all-electric aircraft, purpose-built to fly back-to-back trips over congested cities.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   [Music]
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   Midnight takes off vertically like a helicopter,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   then its propellers transition down to fly like an airplane.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   It's designed to be piloted and carried for passengers, and can travel at speeds up to 150 miles per hour.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   Since 2018, we've made an incredible amount of progress to bringing the Midnight aircraft to market.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   Our nearly 1,000-person team has designed, built, and tested the key enabling technologies to bring electric aviation to market.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   This has enabled us to raise nearly $1.5 billion to date.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   However, our goal is the same since day one, to get to commercial launch.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   [Music]
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   Our high-volume manufacturing facility in Georgia will open up later this year,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   and we have incredible partners that are helping us bring this vision to life.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   [Music]
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Ram, and Maserati, has invested nearly $300 million to date.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   United Airlines has ordered up to $1.5 billion of Midnight aircraft,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   and with Southwest, our goal is to offer passengers three-hour, multimodal journeys across California.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   [Music]
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   We have an industry-leading contract with the Air Force,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   and we recently delivered our first aircraft as part of that contract.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.320]   In LA, we recently announced plans for flight networks connecting SoFi Stadium, USC, LAX, and beyond.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   We can't wait to bring Midnight to a city near you.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   [Music]
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   [Applause]
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   Peter Thiel reminded us yesterday that flying cars are the peak of the hardware revolution that never quite happened.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   But as you just saw, we're closer than ever to making it a reality.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   The aircraft that the three of our companies design take off vertically like helicopters.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   They do a complex maneuver to transition onto the wing, into wing-borne flight, and fly like an aircraft.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   When the founder of our company, Larry Page, first joined this mission,
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.320]   the technologies that enable these aircraft to fly were just starting to become possible.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   The team that I lead has built the enabling technologies in electrification and autonomy that's making this possible.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   You see the prior five generations of aircraft that we've designed here on the screen behind me,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   and that iterative design-build approach has enabled us to get to the point where we are building now generation six,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   which is the first candidate for an FAA certification of a passenger autonomous aircraft.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   This aircraft is designed to take advantage of all of the prior technologies that we developed through those prior iterations
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   and to operate without a pilot on board on those missions.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   There's two technology trends that we are all using to create these aircraft.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   Boaters and the same simplification that's coming to your cars,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   and batteries and the same advances that are coming to your cars and also to your cell phones.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   And second, autonomy. And autonomy has a lot of parts to it.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   So we have to, for the first time in a commercially certifiable way,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   show how we can operate and supervise an aircraft from the ground,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   display information in a way that is safe from a human factor standpoint to supervise that aircraft,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   to use sensors on the airplane in the same way that you would for an autonomous ground vehicle,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   to create the software and the computation to be able to then fly that aircraft autonomously.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   But when you make robots, people don't go away. They change what they're doing.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   And so we use those aircraft to actually do deployment testing in networks.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   Here in Los Angeles, last year, we flew the first electric VTOL aircraft in the Los Angeles area
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   and we showed what's possible with these aircraft and how people can engage with them.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   We are also working on the human interface with air traffic control,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   because again, even though we have an autonomous aircraft,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   our aircraft still has to interface with today's air traffic control system.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   Like what you saw yesterday from Waymo, we use existing flying cars,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   aka helicopters that are piloted, to take that sensor package and those computation abilities
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   and put them onto a piloted helicopter to perfect the algorithms that we use for doing things like
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.320]   detecting and avoiding other traffic in environments where there's different lighting
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   where the aircraft that you might collide with potentially that you want to avoid is above or below the horizon.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   We also have to be able to fly these aircraft without the presence of GPS.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   As we see in conflicts around the world today, we cannot rely on GPS to be able to fly an autonomous aircraft.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   So now once you have that technology stack, you need to turn it into an actual airplane.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:04.320]   And all the things that Peter talked about, about potentially being a bad industry to go into in the '90s,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   are now becoming ever more important.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   The ability to do aerodynamics, to do mechanical engineering, to create these aircraft are now more important than ever.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   And by the end of this year, we'll be flying this aircraft,
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   which will be the first attempt at certifying a passenger-carrying autonomous aircraft.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   So let's bring the guys out and we'll talk about it.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   [Applause]
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   Well, I think that there's a lot of people that probably need an introduction to VTOL in a more basic way.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   Before we talk about the technology, whether it's the actual vehicle itself,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:48.320]   or whether it's the world's best pilot, if you will.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   For the folks out here, if they are going to interact with these systems, whether autonomous or not,
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.320]   what do you think are going to be the biggest issues that they are going to care about
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   and will want resolved before they see it in their community?
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   Maybe, Joven, if you want to start.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   Yeah, I think the number one issue for everybody when you're getting in an aircraft is, is this going to be safe?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   But then for both the passengers, what they care about is something that's going to dramatically change
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   the way they move around their cities and save them time.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   And in order to do that, you need to have takeoff and landing locations
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   that are located both close to where you are and close to where you want to go.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   And so priority two through nine in people's priority stack is about noise.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   And making an acoustic signature that's going to get communities to see this as a real advantage
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   and something that increases the value of living in that community
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   because you're close to this new mode of transportation.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   Do you guys think that when you see a thousand of these things flying around,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   let's just take a place in Menlo Park, California,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   are they going to be forced to have very specific sort of like air highways that they have to adhere to?
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   Or what is the best thinking right now in terms of how the regulatory bodies are going to sort of enable
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   you guys to actually fly commercially as quickly as possible?
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   Hey, Brian, turn to you.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   If we just take a step back, the product exists, they're called helicopters.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   And a helicopter is actually way more complex than what we're building.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   We're actually building a much more simplified version of what exists.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   It's safer, it's fully redundant.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   And so it should inspire confidence for people to want to come and take these vehicles.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   The way they'll start though is going to be really slow.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   If you think about every major city in the world, they have hospitals.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   Those hospitals have helicopters.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   This product exists everywhere.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   So if you took all three of us, you took our most bullish estimates that we have
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   and you tripled them, we still would not even replace helicopters.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   So to get to the point where you're asking thousands of vehicles in the air over one city
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   or even hundreds is pretty far away.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   We could all deploy tens of thousands of vehicles.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   The three of us be trillion dollar companies and there still would not be thousand dollar,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   well, hopefully, there still would not be thousands of vehicles in the air.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   But to make the product really, really great, you do want liquidity.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   You do want a lot of vehicles on dense routes.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.320]   So you don't have to worry about is it available, it's not available, like an Uber, right?
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   You just, it's thumbs up, it's available, or it's thumbs down, it's not available.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   It doesn't matter what seat you get.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   It saves you time.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   That's what we're all trying to get.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   But I think just to frame it.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   - Sorry, Adam, is it a thing where it is like Uber,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   where there's going to be a version where you get in with people you don't know,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   or you think this is just like one person provisions it for themselves
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   and then they go from point A to point B?
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   - No, absolutely.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.320]   The vision is a service that's available for everyone.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   The good news is you can scale these vehicles
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   because they're just much more simple than helicopters.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   We don't have all the limiting factors that helicopters have,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   so you can put a lot more from the air.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.320]   You can push the prices way down and make it very affordable.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   - It's also a dramatically faster trip.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   So you're in it for a few minutes to get across LA
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   instead of in Uber where you might be sitting in traffic for an hour or two.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   - Right.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   Yesterday we heard from Takedra, from the CEO of Waymo.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   Their first launch city was Phoenix.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   The layout was good, but mostly it was really regulatorily--
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   - Amenable.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   - Amenable.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   - Brian, what is the version of Phoenix for eVTOL?
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   Is there a city somewhere that has said, "We want this now.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   Come and help us figure this out"?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   - Yeah, Houston.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   Houston is where we're working most specifically.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   And it's not just because Woody lives there either.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   But seriously, Houston is--
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   The airport network in Houston is actually quite good,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   connecting a couple of the airports around the Houston area.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   It turns out that operating at airports initially
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   is actually quite a good place to start
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   because, like I said, these aircraft, they come with a footprint.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.320]   They really come with people and operations.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   If you've ever seen an airport tarmac area,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   you can't just drop that in the middle of a city on day one.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   So starting at airports as an initial operating area is quite good.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   It turns out what you saw in that video
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.320]   was from an airspace integration standpoint
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   and where you're going on routes and so on,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.320]   New Zealand has been incredibly forward-thinking
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   in terms of how to evolve their airspace network
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   so that they have more digital communications,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   more of an ability to integrate uncrewed aircraft
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   with crewed aircraft in the same airspace.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   And so we've been doing quite a lot of work in New Zealand on that front.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   - But hold on.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   I mean, I think it's, to me, super clear this does not start in the U.S.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   I really think it starts internationally.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.320]   I think the regulatory environment here--
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   - We're at 'em.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   - Both of us work in the UAE pretty extensively.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   I mean, if I'm going to guess just on the press that you put out,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   Joe Benn met the head of the Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE yesterday.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   I'm leaving tonight on a plane to go meet him as well.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   And so we are targeting Abu Dhabi.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   They've been targeting Dubai.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   And the reason is there is a very heavy support for new innovation.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   And the challenge--
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   The reason why I feel like all three of us are up on stage here
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   is probably because of the whole Woody video that we just watched.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   We all learned about NASA as young kids and were inspired by new things.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   But the challenge is the existing environment today makes that very hard.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   And these are companies that were started in America with American engineers
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   that have raised capital from the American venture community
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   that are listed on the American stock exchanges,
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.320]   yet we still can't launch in America.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.320]   And that is really challenging.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   And I think part of it is back to what Bill Gurley talked about last year,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320]   regulatory capture.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   The walls are huge to climb.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   And in fact, the more things go bad with the incumbents, the harder it is for us.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   I don't think that's done on purpose, but that's very challenging for us now.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   I would say that the amount of bipartisan support
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   on both sides of the aisle in Washington is off the charts.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   The amount of local support with states--
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Yesterday I was in Montreal at the International Civil Aviation Association conference
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   where they convened--this is the first time--
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:36.320]   and they were convening 1,800 people to focus on advanced air mobility.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   And so this is really exciting to see how much momentum there is.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   And it's imperative that the U.S. continue to lead.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   Aviation is one of our most important exports.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   It's been vital to our economy.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   And it is really, really important that we lean forward
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   and we make the certification process--
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   Just to double-click on this for a second, I can see how Joe, Ben, and Adam,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:08.320]   you guys, pure play startups, you have to find the willing parent.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   But you have the benefit of Boeing.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.320]   And is that why your answer was Houston?
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.320]   Is it because they have that, I guess, regulatory gravitas
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   to be able to go and help there?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   Or no, you're still mostly on your own trying to figure this out?
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   - Yeah, so the journey of our company was obviously started by Larry.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   - Started by Larry Page.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   - Became Kitty Hawk, turned into a joint venture,
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   and eventually we sold the company to Boeing last year.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   And so we still operate as an independent company,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   a lot like the Waymo/Google relationship right now.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   For us, the difference is we're really trying to pioneer the pathway
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   to the introduction of autonomous aircraft at the same time.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   And that's a longer journey.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   So Joe, Ben, and Adam are going to be operating before us, there's no doubt,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   because piloted aircraft are coming before these uncrewed aircraft.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   I think autonomy is key to the future of aviation in the small airplane space.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   If you look at the causes of incidents and the accident rates
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   in helicopters right now, they're just unacceptable.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   And I think that that can be solved by automation.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   I'm really passionate about that.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   So for us, we're on a longer journey.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   And the question is then, on that journey,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   how do we make sure that the U.S. leads in that?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   And we're trying to pioneer the regulatory pathway
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   to ensure that it happens here in the United States.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   But we're also working around the globe, like I mentioned in New Zealand,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.320]   where there are regulators who potentially want to lean forward
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   and innovate on airspace or some other aspects of the problem
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   that we're trying to solve.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   - I mean, Adam mentioned the concept of regulatory capture,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.320]   but one of our besties, Skye Dayton, who's on Joby's board,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   wrote this great essay, and one of the things that's clear
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.320]   is that a lot of the pushback to the vision that you have, Brian,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   actually comes from the pilots' unions themselves, right?
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   And it's a bit of a weird set of incentives.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   Do you want to just talk about that for a second?
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   - I think it's less salacious than that and more clinical.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.320]   I mean, I'll give an example.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   Well, so my vision for the future is that we're going to have
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   a prolific amount of uncrewed small aircraft that are operating,
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   doing the kind of missions that we're just talking about,
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   but that large aircraft are going to be piloted
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   for probably as far as the eye can see.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.320]   I think the practical aspect of it, honestly, is that in 2023--
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   here's a statistic for you that just blows my mind
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320]   as a developer of airplanes.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   In 2023, there were 30 million global flights,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   carried billions of passenger and plane minutes,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   number of people that got on board the airplane,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   scheduled service, you know, airlines,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   zero accidents, zero.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   - What?
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   - Zero. In 2023, zero.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.320]   So it's less salacious than there's a cabal
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   that's trying not to certificate things.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   There is a natural conservatism in the system of,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   "Holy cow, we've done it. It's working.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.320]   Don't change it." - Right.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   - So when new technology shows up,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   I understand the perspective of a regulator
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   that's sitting on the other side of that wall
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.320]   and is saying, "Man, this is kind of working."
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   - Okay, then just to put you on the spot,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   I mean, I can see, you know, when Joe, Ben, and Adam say,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   "Hey, point A to point B, instead of hours in traffic,
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   you're there in ten minutes."
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   If there are really no pilot errors,
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   unlike in cars where there's still
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   far too many unnecessary deaths,
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   how do you measure the incremental justification
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.320]   for the investment, let alone the reason to switch?
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   - The statistic that I just gave you is for large aircraft,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   scheduled air carriers.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   If you then look at the small airplane market
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   or you look at helicopter markets,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   it is orders of magnitude.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.320]   Well, it's infinity more, you know?
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   But it's way worse.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   And so the question is, how do you bring
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   the level of safety of those large aircraft,
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.320]   how do you bring that same level of safety
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   down into the smaller aircraft?
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   - Get rid of recreational pilots.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   - You have to start. You just have to start.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   I mean, there is definitely, this panel exists in China.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   And guess what?
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   There's two groups that are already certified there.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   They started. That's how you do it.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   You have to get moving.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   You have to set an environment
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   where we can all start flying stuff.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   When we can do it A to B and hopefully here.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   - When you're using a large aircraft,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   you're dividing the two pilots' expense
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   amongst 300 seats or 100 seats.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   And in this case, you would have a pilot on a Joby flight,
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   which really, the pilot's not doing anything.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   They're not flying it.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   So they're there to make the passengers feel safer,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   is my understanding, yeah?
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   - The pilot, you know, there are,
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.320]   even with what Brian's doing,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   with the incredible pioneering work on autonomy,
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   you still have somebody on the ground
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   who's making sure that the weather is going to be safe
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.320]   and lots of other operational logistics.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   The benefit is you get to take that person
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   out of the aircraft and put them on the ground.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.320]   So you get to put another passenger in the aircraft.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   You get a lot of operational flexibility
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   because you don't necessarily have to have the pilot
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   and the plane at the same location at the same time.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   A pilot can, over time,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   begin to operate multiple aircraft at the same time.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   - What is the pilot doing in Joby?
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   Because my understanding is it's automated.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   So they're sitting there just monitoring it.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   - They're making sure that all of the operations
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   are going to go safely.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.320]   - But they're not on a Joby flight.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   - But the pilots are flying.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   There's sticks, right? I mean...
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   - There is the option for the pilot
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   to fly with the sticks as well.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.320]   - So in an emergency situation, they would take over,
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   but it's autopilot, essentially.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   - There are a lot of computer systems
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.320]   that are helping the pilot fly.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   - And when one rotor goes down...
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   I mean, one of the great things about this
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   is when you have a helicopter,
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.320]   you know, a rotor breaks, you die, essentially.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   - We have layer on layer of redundancy.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   We have six propellers,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   and each one's driven by separate motors
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   with each separate inverter,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   with each a separate battery pack.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   And so it's just, you know,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   the same thing with the flight computers and the...
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   - Everything's massively redundant.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   - Exactly.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.320]   And that's what we did in big commercial airlines,
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   which is why you get the incredible safety
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   that Brian was talking about.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   - Yeah, I mean, we haven't had a passenger death
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   in the United States.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   I think the last one was 2009.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   And the last three passenger jets
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   that went down in the United States
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   were all regional jets,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   which we all know there's a collection of problems there.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   So what would it take, theoretically,
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   when you're doing your, you know, edge cases?
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   What are the edge cases that are the most challenging
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   in terms of safety?
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   - Well, so, you know,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.320]   with our initial certification,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   we are not certifying for flight unknown icing, for example.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   So if you live in the Northeast, you know,
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   there will be a few percent of the time
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   where we won't be able to offer service.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.320]   - You'll just ground them during ice conditions.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   You're not going to JFK when it's snowing.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   - Well, you know, when it's snowing,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   you may be able to go,
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   but if there's certain conditions--
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   - Right, sure.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   - Where you get heavier icing.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   - That's for icing in terms of concerns
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   and things that could make these go down.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   - Exactly.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   - Is there anything else, though, that could, you know--
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   - What's like the wind speed or gusting kind of condition,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   Max, and so on?
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   - So we're actually very tolerant to that.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   It was actually, it was interesting--
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.320]   - It's probably better than a winged aircraft,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   I would imagine, right?
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   - And so there's these folks at NASA
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   who are working on wildfire prevention.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   - Yeah.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   - And they came and did a,
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   not the wildfire prevention folks,
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   but NASA came and did an acoustic survey
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   where they put out a whole array of microphones
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   and we flew the aircraft in hover and transition,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   over flight, et cetera,
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   and measured the acoustic signature
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   and showed that it was really low
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   and could fit into the environment.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   In terms of, but yesterday I was having a conversation
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   with them on wildfire prevention.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   They're like, these kinds of aircraft
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   are gonna be game changers for wildfire
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   because with helicopters,
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   they can't handle really turbulent conditions--
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   - Right.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   - When you've got lots of convection from the wildfire.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   And-- - And you have six motors.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   - We have six rotors.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   And so there's this thing called vortex ring state
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   that affects vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   And you aren't gonna have all six rotors
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   go into vortex ring state at the same time.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   And you can also,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   one of the cool things they found out with the Ospreys,
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   if you just tilt the rotors forward,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   that you can very, very quickly get out of vortex ring state.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   - So basically, these new classes of aircraft
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   and what you can do with electric propulsion,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   and I don't think we've talked about that enough,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   is what a game changer electric propulsion is.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   - Can you talk about the acoustic issue?
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   So give us some context for the decibel tolerance,
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   where, and what was, you know, in a city,
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   and give us a comparison to stuff that exists today,
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   a big truck, diesel truck, helicopter,
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   like, and what do we need to be at
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   for this to be ubiquitously accepted in cities?
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   And then what's the technology needed
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   to get the acoustic breakthroughs needed?
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   - Yeah, so the background noise level in cities
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   is around 65 decibels.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.320]   And so we set that as our threshold
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   for this is the level that we want things,
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   you know, want our aircraft to be below
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   during takeoff and landing.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   - You don't wanna be beyond background.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.320]   - Right, we wanna be below 45 decibels in overflight.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   And we've achieved both of those goals.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   You know, you asked about other things.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   You know, I think a garbage truck is 80 or 90 decibels.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   - They're the worst.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.320]   - Exactly.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   - The worst, like, I mean.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   - Every 10 decibels is an order of magnitude
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   more noise energy.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   So it's, you know, a jet engine is like 110 decibels.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   Helicopters are between 80 and 100 decibels.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   The other thing about helicopters
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   that people find really annoying
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   is it's this low-frequency wop-wop.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   And that low-frequency sound travels long distance
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.320]   through the atmosphere and--
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.320]   - So what's the tech needed?
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.320]   - Like it shakes buildings and really annoys people.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   - What's the tech needed to bring the acoustics?
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   Like how hard is--
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   - Well, I mean, you know, when I started Joby in 2009,
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   so it was 15 years ago this week.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   So it was like, I've been working on this a long time.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.320]   I've been dreaming about it since I was a kid.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   And it's incredible to see the industry that we've built.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   And again, yesterday to see like thousands of people gather
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   just to focus on all of the issues
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   of bringing this to their cities around the world.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   So that's really exciting.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.320]   And the rollout and the impact that this is gonna have
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   on cities is just really, really exciting.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   - So let me ask you guys--
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   - In fact, you're spinning the propeller slower.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   That's what you're doing.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   That's what electric engines do.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   That just create lower noise.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.320]   That gets you like 90% of the benefit.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   And then from there you work to all the little efficiencies
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   to get that stuff out.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   - So let me ask you guys about the convenience
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   of owning a car.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   And like America kind of popularized this idea
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   that everyone should own a car.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   And then we all got a car.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   The benefit of a car is it's point to point.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   I can go from any point A to any point B.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   How do you guys think about the challenge of,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   it's such a pain in the ass to go to a port,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   just like it's a pain in the ass to go to a bus station,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   take a bus or subway, go to a spot.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   In New York it works where things are dense enough.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   But like in most cities in the United States,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   this is like, it is preferable to take a car
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   'cause I can do point A to point B.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   And my convenience, which my time,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   is always faster taking a car.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   How do you kind of think about the calculus
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   of the benefit here when I have to go to a port
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   to be able to take the vehicle to the next port?
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   - I think you're spot on.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   I think of where we are today is very similar
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   to where the automotive industry was in the 1890s,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   where it was before we had the ability
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   to mass produce cars.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   We were building tens and then hundreds of cars.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   And that didn't give the scale.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   And so what we were using cars for was taxis.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   We are in a similar mode today
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   where we are going to use these aircraft as taxis.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   We still need to save people time.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   And so there's only gonna be select routes
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   where this is a game changer
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   because of the multimodal nature where you need to,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   and you may not have a takeoff and landing location
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   exactly where you wanna leave from and go to.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   But over time, if we can get the acoustic signature down,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   if we can make these aircraft even quieter
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   than they are today,
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   rather than needing to go to a dedicated vertiport
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   to do this, the dream is to eventually be able
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   to land them at your house.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   - Adam, let's talk about propulsion for a second.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   Energy density, cost, those trade-offs, speed,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.320]   these are all variables
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   that kind of just work opposing each other.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   What were some design decisions you guys made?
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.320]   And did you have to remake some of those?
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   Did you change your mind at some point?
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   And just walk us through that process.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   - The biggest challenge, I think,
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   of building these aircraft
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   is just the time it takes to do it.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   It is very expensive,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   and it does not fit any typical model,
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   meaning the venture guys don't like it.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   And so they're like, "Sorry, you want a billion dollars
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.320]   "up front to build this?
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   "Like, that's terrible.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   "You rejected me, you rejected me.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   "I don't think I met with you."
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.320]   Everybody rejected, probably all of us up here.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   And so it's not a typical, you know what I mean?
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   Like, "Mom, that's the reality."
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   So there was this crazy period of time in 2021
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   where the capital markets opened up.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   It was a dream scenario.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   - Totally.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   - Raised a lot of money from the public markets.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   That was nuts.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   So that allowed this to happen.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   And then from there, for me, what we did was we said,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   "Okay, what is the business case?"
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   Meaning we thought, when we looked at, like,
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   what are these, we call them hero routes,
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   where there's a lot of people doing these trips,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   like Manhattan to JFK.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   It's like 30 million people go from Manhattan
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   to one of the three big airports in New York.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   Okay, so all we have to do is--
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   - No brainer, that's a no brainer.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   - Yeah, all we have to do is have a couple
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   around the city, which already exist.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   There's downtown, Wall Street heliport,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   west side, east side.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   - East side heliport, yeah.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   - And just put them into the three airports.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   And that'll be an amazing thing to start with.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.320]   Okay, so short routes, 20 to 50 mile routes.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   Now let's design an aircraft around that,
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.320]   the fastest thing we can do to get to market
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   so we don't die before the investors decide,
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   "Nah, we're kind of like done with this one.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   "Now on to the next thing.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   "Oh, AI, here, let's everybody go all in on AI."
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   And so I'm just moving as fast as we can.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   So that was the biggest trade-off.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   So it was always, what is the minimum thing
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   we need to do to get that done?
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.320]   So we need to look at speed range and payload.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   Payload is definitely the hardest
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.320]   because batteries are heavy
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.320]   and there's just physics you're always fighting.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.320]   And then speed, the difference between,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   these planes wanna fly around 120 miles per hour.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   If you go faster, it's just more drag.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   It just kills your battery faster.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   So you don't, the difference between 120,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   150 on a 10 mile flight doesn't really matter.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   It's more of how do you go at least
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   that 20 to 50 mile route and go at least,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   call it 120 miles per hour and do that as fast as possible.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   - And what kind of batteries did you guys choose?
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   What chemistry?
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   - Lithium ion cells, commercial off the shelf stuff.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   Molly cell makes, you can find those cells today.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   There's millions of them that are made
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.320]   and power tools and super cars
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   and pretty conventional off the shelf stuff.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320]   - What's the range?
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   - The range of the aircraft?
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   We're designing to go up to a hundred miles
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.320]   but the real design is around rapid
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.320]   back to back 20 to 50 mile trips.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   - What do you guys all need
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   in terms of battery technology improvement
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   from where we sit today or do you not?
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   And what's on the horizon
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.320]   in terms of battery technology improvements?
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   What does that unlock in terms of range?
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   - Yeah, so the batteries that we're certifying
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   our aircraft with have a specific energy
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.320]   of about 300 watt hours per kilogram.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.320]   To put that in context,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   when I started the company in 2009,
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   we had cells that had sufficient specific power
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   to do a vertical takeoff,
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   but also we're at about 170 watt hours per kilogram.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.320]   So we've almost doubled the specific energy
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   in the cells over the last 15 years.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   That we have cells in our lab
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   and then there's a third dimension
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   which really matters is the life.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   And so we have the cells were taking the certification
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   or give us a 10,025 mile flights.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   So our kind of sweet spot is also
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   in those shorter range flights
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   and we wanna be able to do a lot of flights
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   between replacements both
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   for the environmental impact of it,
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   but also from the economics
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   of replacing those battery packs.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   - And when the plane takes off,
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   that's a lot of energy usage.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320]   The wings tilt forward
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   and now you're flying more like these Ospreys as a plane,
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   the energy goes way down the consumption
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   and then on landing,
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320]   you gotta be very careful
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   and use a lot more energy, is that correct?
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   - Yeah, and there's different trade-offs you can make.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   Basically, the more propulsors you have,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   the smaller each propulsor is
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   and the heavier your disc loading
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   and the higher the amount of power you're using in hover,
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   the harder you're pulling on the batteries.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.320]   But then more propulsors also gives you more redundancy.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   So there's a trade there.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.320]   - Breast tax, when do you each think
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   we're gonna pick a quarter in a year?
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   So fourth quarter 2025, second quarter 2026,
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   you all have to answer it.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   You agreed backstage.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.320]   And Americans will be able to give money
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   to get in one of these, not a test flight,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   you know, in a major city in America
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   when we all be able to use it.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   Not just yours.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.320]   - Yeah, these guys should answer for themselves,
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   but I think they'll get it done in 2026
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   and you should yell at me.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   - Pick a quarter.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   - Oh, man, I don't know.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   First quarter. - Q4, be safe.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   - First quarter, 2026.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   I wanna give 'em some heat.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   We'll be a couple years after that.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   - But that's an incredible thing.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   I mean, we're less, you know, a year plus away.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   That's crazy.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   - Now you should, tell me how you feel
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   about my expectations.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   - I think pretty clearly there's a route
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   to do this internationally next year.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   And so I think we'll launch with passengers next year.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   - He said in the US.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320]   - I know, I'll start there.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   I'll start there in 2025.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   My job is to make sure we have a safe aircraft.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   - Which quarter?
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   - I think probably fourth quarter.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   - Perfect.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   - I think we have a,
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   my job is to create a safe aircraft.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   If Pete Buttigieg called and said,
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   "Hey, there's a way to do this in the US.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   "I'm gonna help cut through all the red tape
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   "and we're gonna help you get it done."
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   Like, my phone's on, I'm ready.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   Call me.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   We'll find a way to do it.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   - I would love to have,
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   Pete, why don't we invite Pete?
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.320]   He seems dynamic.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   - So he was actually, yeah.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   We nearly had him.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   - Yeah.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.320]   - Very close.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   - So I think we're on a timeline
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   which we publicly announced
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   to begin commercial service in the UAE next year.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   - You think Q4 2025 as well?
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   - I think that's, it's likely.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   - Or Q5.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   - I think it's at the back end of next year.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   - How much though?
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   - I mean, we will begin a non,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   you know, begin operations before that,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   but we will not,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   in terms of being able to buy a ticket.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   - Have you figured out the flight profile
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   that you're gonna start with?
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   Like it's airport to X or something like that?
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.320]   - We have four vertiports
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   that we're planning to build in Dubai.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   And the RTA, which is the--
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   - I would like one from the airport to the wind,
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   which opens in 2027.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   - Yeah, from Dubai to the new wind.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   - They're opening a wind.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   - It's a little far 'cause it's in Iraq,
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.320]   so it's a little far away.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.320]   - There's a wind in Dubai that's opening?
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.320]   - Yeah, they're opening a wind, yeah.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   - That's sick, we gotta go.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   - All kidding aside.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   - That's awesome.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   - I wanna talk to you guys.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   We talked yesterday with Elon about this.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   You know, he said it's taken longer
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   to get approval to launch Starship
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   than it did to take launch.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   So this sort of push on regulatory,
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   we're hearing over and over again.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   You work with the FAA closely.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   Can you just describe the path to bring them along,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   get the certifications that you need,
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   and how much of a push or a pull that is
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   in each of your businesses?
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   - Yeah, I guess I'll just start, you know,
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   obviously from the autonomy standpoint,
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   specifically, you know, we're really,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   we're trying to push the frontier.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   And so whenever you're engaging with a regulator,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.320]   no matter if it's aviation or if it's biotech
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   or some other thing, if you're really,
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   really on the frontier, it means that the regulator
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   doesn't necessarily understand the technology
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   any better than you do.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   And so a part of it needs to be kind of a journey
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   where you're going together to really learn
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.320]   how to make it safe.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.320]   At some point, you need to be regulated.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   You know, there needs to be a process
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   of you putting forth, you know,
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   engaging in what are the requirements,
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   you putting forth, here's how we're gonna meet
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.320]   those requirements, and then there's a process.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   I think that, you know, honestly, from my standpoint,
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   that actually works okay.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.320]   I just wish that it was a little more responsive
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   or engaging on some of the deep technical subjects
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   that we have to advance.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   - Do they have the people inside the FAA?
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   - That's part of the challenge.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   So part of the challenge is that in aviation,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   partially because of what Peter Thiel said yesterday,
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   you know, there's sort of a generation of,
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   you know, if you went into aviation,
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   when I went into aviation, the demographics
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   were completely upside down.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   You know, people were retiring, new people
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.320]   weren't coming into the industry.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   And so many of the experts in the FAA
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   that have regulated some of these systems
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   that have created really safe airplanes have retired.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   There's a lot of new people coming into the industry,
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   which is great, but don't necessarily have
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   the expertise of having built some of the systems
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   that we're now building.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   And so there's some way that we almost need
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   to get people to come through the industry and then--
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   - I think this is a really important point,
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   and it's counter to what RFK Jr. has been saying
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   over and over again, and this is why I push back on him.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   I'm sorry this is off topic.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   There is a very important reason
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   to have people from industry become part
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   of the regulatory framework for regulating the industry.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   Because if they don't, they don't know how,
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   and they're gonna have a complete aversion
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   to embracing technological innovation.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.320]   That's why I think it's important
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.320]   that there is a rotation of people
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.320]   that are, you know, consequentially
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   not economically motivated in some way,
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   but that understand the technology and can motivate it.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   But in that framework, let me ask you guys,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   in markets where there is a regulatory framework
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   that allows for accelerated output of innovation,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   let's take China for an example.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   There's a good A/B test maybe underway right now.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   What companies are doing eVTOL technology in China?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   How good are they?
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.320]   And then given the way that the Chinese government
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   can kind of step in and accelerate outcomes,
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   are we going to see and are we seeing eVTOL technology
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   kind of coming to market fast,
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   and in a kind of accelerated way in China,
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   like we're seeing with nuclear and other tools
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   that the government's saying is a priority and a mandate?
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.320]   - Yeah, I mean, you have Ehang and Autoflight,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   and they're-- - Those are Chinese companies.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   - X-Fang, and, you know, a bunch of them
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   are making great progress.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   There's a lot of enthusiasm in China.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   The regulatory pathway there is more forward-leaning,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.320]   I think, as Adam pointed out.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.320]   And I think you're gonna see more rapid iteration.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.320]   I think the good news here in the U.S.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   is that the FAA is in the process
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   of releasing something called Mosaic,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   which for aircraft that are smaller than ours,
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   aircraft with, like, two passengers in 'em,
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   more of a personal ownership type of thing,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   that's gonna allow much more rapid development
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   and a lighter touch from the FAA.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   Just to put this in context,
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   the FAA has done, I think, an incredible job,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   and they've really been leaning in.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   When I went and first talked to them in 2009,
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   they thought this was, like, absolutely crazy.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   Like, they just did not think
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   we were gonna be able to build an electric aircraft,
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   let alone one that could take off and land vertically,
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   and which was quiet in all these different dimensions.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.320]   We then, you know, began working with them regularly in 2015,
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   began formal certification in 2018,
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   had our Stage 4 G1 in 2020, G2, and then G3,
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   and now we're working on Stage 4.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   So, you know, with each, you know,
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.320]   we are building momentum.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   We are writing all the rules.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   It's very heavy lifting, and--
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320]   - Joe Ben told me once,
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   'cause Joe Ben has been kind of the first
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   through the pipeline there,
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   and he said, "I feel like a pipe cleaner
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   "for how to certify these things."
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   And I guess there's one thing I would just throw
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   into the regulatory, like, context,
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   'cause I think you bring up a good point,
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   is it's not like these things were sitting on the shelf
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   and a regulator was sitting somewhere saying,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   "You can't use that."
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   We have been on a journey that we just all talked about,
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   getting these things ready.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   So they're now just at the point where they're ready,
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   and the question is, can we take that first step
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   in the U.S. to really get it done?
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   - And does the U.S.,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   do they approach that from a culture of,
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   "Let's just try something.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   "If we get it wrong, we can iterate it,"
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   or is it more, "We must get this right
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   "because there's all kinds of consequences,
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   "political or otherwise."
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   - It's so much more simple than that.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.320]   They want to do it.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   The people at the top are actually genuinely
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   very excited.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   Former FAA Administrator, Billy Nolan,
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   stepped down from his role, joined Archer.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   The new one, Mike Whitaker, came from an eVTOL company.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   They were very excited to do it.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   The challenge is, with probably most regulatory set-ups,
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.320]   is not a lot of incentive.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   It's not like there's a downside to not doing it,
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   a lot of disincentive to do it,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   meaning if something goes bad,
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   there's only downside there,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   and it's a slog and it's hard.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320]   This is hard.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   This is not easy to go through all this.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   The incentives are not great,
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   and then on top of all of it,
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   there's no policy saying,
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   "Hey, America needs to be innovative.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   "We need to go do this.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   "Let's go and get it."
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   There's no culture to do it.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   - Why is there no mandate?
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   It would be great if some leader said,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.320]   "You guys need to get this done,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   "and we need to have these things flying safely
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   "in the next 36 months."
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   How does that happen in our current system?
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   I can understand how it happens in UAE.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   - Trump literally put out a video on it.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   He put out a video, agenda number whatever,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   39 or something like that,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   where he talked about building future cities.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.320]   I'm guessing he went to Dubai and then--
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   - I'm sorry, but is that something, Adam,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.320]   that we could change through an executive order?
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   - I think it's culture you have to change,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   meaning we will do this
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.320]   and break down all the barriers to get it done
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   because it's not that hard.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   We've all laid out the rules to certify.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   Why can't you let us just go do the tests,
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   and then if we do the tests,
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   you check them off, we're good.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   It shouldn't be that easy.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320]   - If you're a bureaucrat,
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   if you're working in one of these organizations,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   if it goes poorly, you're in big trouble.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   If it goes well--
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   - But are you, though?
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   - Well, the SEC had this mandate,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.320]   it's very similar,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   to allow more accredited investors,
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   sophisticated investors,
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   allow people to take tests,
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   and to just allow more access
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   to private companies and investing,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.320]   which would be good for a company like yours,
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   and they have slow-walked it.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   So I think that's part of the problem is why--
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.320]   - Just to build on what Adam's saying.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.320]   Okay, let's just say the SEC doesn't do anything,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   or they do it and they make a mistake.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   Nobody at the SEC will get fired.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   I don't think the culture is
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.320]   that if a commercial airline has an issue,
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   or, for example, in the 737 MAX issue,
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   did more people at Boeing get fired,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   did more people at the FAA get fired,
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   or did nobody get fired?
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   - Nobody.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   - Aviation is different in the comparison
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   with the SEC, as an example.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   Aviation is different.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.320]   Actually, aerospace is different,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.320]   and I would just call out one thing
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   that I saw on the stage yesterday,
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   which really hit me.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   If you saw Elon's face when he talked
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   about the safety of the astronaut,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   you saw his face.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   - He was almost crying.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   - Yes, he was almost crying.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   And that's what aerospace is all about.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   And so there is a,
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   the reason that the industry has been able
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   to get to that unbelievable statistic
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   that I just talked about
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   is that it's gone through awful accidents.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.320]   It's gone through terrible things that have happened
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   and have turned into the rules
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   that we are now all being regulated towards.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   What's happening now is that we're showing up
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.320]   with new technology.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.320]   So I'll give you an example, like regulations.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.320]   They currently say the pilot shall do X,
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.320]   and it says that 50 times,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   but we don't have a pilot.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   And so when we're showing up,
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   we have to kind of rewrite what that is.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   I understand why it says the pilot shall do X.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   It says that because there were accidents in the past
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.320]   that have now been regulated out of existence.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   - But you're also looking at it
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.320]   from the negative point of view.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.320]   How many lives could be saved
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   if we got this stuff into,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   pick a country, India or Africa,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   we could bring clean water and medicine
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   and supplies to people, disaster relief.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   It doesn't cost $10,000 an hour
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.320]   to fly a Blackhawk anymore
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   into some disaster relief situation.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   It costs $500 an hour,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   and we can send 50 immediately,
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   and they're always available.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.320]   The uptime is super huge.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.320]   And so I actually think you could save a lot of lives too.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.320]   - And what about saving lives here in the US?
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   We lose 40,000 people every year on the roads.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   - Yeah, which is insane.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   - And we fly almost as many miles as we drive.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.320]   So driving is more than 10,000 times more dangerous
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   per passenger mile than flying is.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   So we could actually,
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.320]   by moving people into the air
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   for their daily transportation,
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.320]   save thousands and tens of thousands of lives.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   But we need to get the technology out there.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   We need to start learning.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   - I hope Peter Thiel had it wrong,
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.320]   and we are going to get flying cars
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   in the next couple of years.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.320]   And I want to thank you all for being here.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   Please join me in thanking our panel.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   (applause)
