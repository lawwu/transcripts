[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   - Let me give you a little hack here on the C stuff.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.560]   So my agent said C, the inside items.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.800]   - Yeah. - Personal belongings,
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.880]   he described it as this, which I thought was a great,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.640]   just a perfect analogy for it.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.840]   If I were to take your home,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   and I'd pick it up off the ground, and I were to shake it,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.860]   anything that falls out would be considered
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.920]   those personal belongings.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.120]   Now, I had installed speakers in my ceilings
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.680]   and all that stuff, and he's, those are hard attached.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.120]   Those are attached to your home.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.880]   You couldn't remove them without causing damage to the home.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.920]   So we have to include that in the main dwelling.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.800]   And if you hit your cap there,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560]   then they're not covering the speakers.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.040]   So I hit my cap on the dwelling.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.440]   So they're like, oh, you're out the cost of speakers.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   The electronics are related to that stuff
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.440]   that it was hard mounted.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.120]   It's actually to your benefit to get like sound bars
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.560]   and stuff that isn't- - Now if it's mounted to the wall.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.520]   - Then you'll be okay with that if it's mounted to the wall.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.920]   But just remember, if you're going and doing that dream
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.760]   7.1 surround sound system where it's all put into the wall
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   and all that, they are not gonna include that.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920]   As a personal belonging, it's part of your dwelling.
