[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   Let us pray. Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we turn to Thee, conscious ever that apart
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.400]   from Thee we can do nothing, and conscious that we are handling holy things, conscious
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.960]   of our proneness to wonder, we therefore pray Thee to look upon us and to grant us Thy blessing.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.240]   May we be conscious, O Lord, that we do everything as under Thine all-seeing eye, and grant that
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.680]   we ever may be animated by the desire to minister to Thy glory and to Thy praise. So we commend
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.680]   ourselves to Thee this afternoon. Hear us, we humbly pray Thee, in Christ Jesus' name.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.680]   Amen.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   I'd remind you that we are now still trying to establish this proposition that preaching
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.560]   is the primary task of the church and of the minister in the church. We've produced scriptural
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   proofs of this and further proofs from church history. And then we've tried to develop the
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.640]   theological argument for this, how our very theology insists upon this because of the
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.100]   subject with which we're dealing. And then having laid that down, we're considering some
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.040]   objections to all this. The first is, haven't times changed? And the second is, can't all
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.720]   this be done now by means of reading or by means of watching television or listening
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:43.720]   to radio and so on? And now that brings me to a third objection. And this is the objection
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:53.440]   which asks, can't all this be done rather by means of group discussions? Why must it
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.000]   be preaching? Why this particular form? Can't this be replaced by a kind of dialogue, as
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.880]   it's now called, an exchange of views? Shouldn't we rather encourage more questions at the
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.420]   end of sermons? And this dialogue between the minister and the people who come to listen,
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.000]   that's within the realm of the church. But furthermore, it is suggested that this can
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.300]   be done also, again, say on the television by means of discussions, that you have a panel
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.180]   of people, some of them Christians and some of them not Christians, and that they engage
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.820]   in a discussion together. And the suggestion being that this is not only a good way of
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.140]   evangelizing and making known the message of the Bible, but that it is in the present
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.980]   age a superior one to preaching. Now I think that as this is gaining a good deal of support
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.660]   and gaining certainly a great deal of publicity at the present time in most countries, we've
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:16.180]   got to address ourselves to this. I would answer it by putting it to you in this form.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.140]   It's a personal reminiscence, again, but I put it in that form in order that the principles
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.320]   which I hold may stand out more clearly. I remember back about 1942, I received an invitation
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.060]   to have a public debate on the question of religion with a man who was very famous at
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.140]   that time in your country as well as in Britain, the late Dr. C.E.M. Jode. He had gained a
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.180]   good deal of publicity and, not to say notoriety, by taking part in what was called a brains
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.820]   trust on the radio. And he was a very popular speaker, then holding more or less atheistical
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.620]   views. And I was asked to debate religion with him at the Union Debating Society in
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.900]   the University of Oxford. I'm even troubling with the background to that and other reasons
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.540]   why I was asked to do that. But it really did arise out of my preaching. That's one
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.780]   of my reasons for mentioning it to you. I was taking part in a mission in the university
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.380]   and it was directly as the result of my preaching on a Sunday night that this invitation came
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:42.180]   to me. Well, now, I turned down that invitation. I refused to do it. So I'll put my case to
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.060]   you in terms of asking the question, was I right in refusing this? There were many who
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.180]   took the view that I was wrong, but it was a wonderful opportunity for preaching and
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.860]   presenting the gospel, that the very fame of Dr. Jode in itself would attract a wonderful
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.460]   house to listen to the debate. It might very well obtain publicity in the press and so
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:19.300]   on. And some felt that I was rejecting and missing a wonderful evangelistic opportunity.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.940]   But I maintained then, and I still maintain, that my decision was the correct one. And
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:33.300]   my reasons are these. That I think that that whole approach is wrong. Quite apart from
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.940]   any detailed reasons which I'm going to give you, I think it's wrong as a total approach.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:48.900]   And I would suggest immediately that experience of that kind of thing shows very clearly that
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   it very rarely succeeds or leads to anything. It provides entertainment, but as I'm aware
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:04.020]   of it and in my experience and knowledge of it, it has very rarely been fruitful or effective
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.300]   as a means of winning people to the Christian faith. But more important are my detailed
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:17.060]   reasons. And the first is this, and to me this was an all-sufficient reason in itself.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.900]   God is not to be discussed or debated. God is not a subject for debate because he is
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:34.060]   who he is and what he is. Now we are told that the unbeliever of course doesn't believe
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.980]   that, and that is perfectly true. But that makes no difference. We believe this. And
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.220]   it is a part of our very case to assert this. Holding the view that we do, believing what
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:56.540]   we do about God, we cannot in any circumstances allow him to become a subject for discussion
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:05.820]   or of debate. A part of our whole argument is this, is the word addressed by God himself,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:13.220]   you remember, to Moses at the burning bush. Moses had suddenly seen this phenomenon and
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.100]   was proposing to turn aside and to examine this remarkable and astonishing thing. But
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.060]   immediately he is rebuked by the voice which came to him and said, "Take off thy shoes
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.540]   from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground." That seems
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.940]   to me to be the governing principle in this whole matter. Our attitude is more important
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:48.740]   than anything that we do in detail. And as we are reminded in the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:57.060]   God is always to be approached with reverence and with godly fear, for our God is a consuming
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:10.980]   fire. Now to me this is a very vital matter. To discuss the being of God in a casual manner,
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:17.980]   lounging on an armchair, smoking a pipe or a cigarette or a cigar, is to me something
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:27.860]   that we should never allow. Because God, as I say, is not a kind of philosophic X or a
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:35.500]   concept. We believe we are dealing with the living God. And whatever may be true of anybody
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:43.140]   else, we must never put ourselves or allow ourselves to be put into a position in which
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:51.140]   we are debating God as if he were but a philosophical proposition or any other kind of proposition.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:58.460]   To me this is an overriding consideration and is enough in and of itself. But there
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:06.300]   are obviously supporting reasons which arise inevitably out of that. So the second argument
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:14.780]   I would deduce would be this, that in discussing these matters we are dealing with the most
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:23.420]   serious and the most solemn thing in life. We are dealing with something that we believe
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.300]   is not only going to affect the lives of these people with whom we are concerned while they
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:35.260]   are in this world, but also their eternal destiny. In other words, the very character
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:43.460]   and nature of the subject is such that it cannot possibly be placed in any context except
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:54.700]   of that of the most solemn and serious atmosphere that we know or are capable of. Certainly
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:02.740]   it can never be approached in a light spirit or in a mere debating spirit. And still less
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:10.700]   can it ever be regarded as a matter of entertainment. Now I'm not familiar with your programs,
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:18.020]   but certainly these supposed discussions and dialogues on religion that we have in Great
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:25.260]   Britain and the television and so on are nothing really but sheer entertainment. Equal time
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:32.460]   is given to the unbeliever as to the believer. And there's cut and thrust and jocularity
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:39.260]   and fun. It's entertainment. And of course it's meant to be entertainment. Now I'm arguing
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.860]   that the matter with which we are concerned is so desperately serious and vital and urgent
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.620]   that we can never participate in such activities. We can never allow it to be approached in
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:57.620]   this way at all. And I think I can give you a very good and sound reason for this. Take
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:08.500]   for instance the position of any one of us who might suddenly develop a serious illness.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.460]   Suddenly you are stricken with a very serious illness. Not only are you in great pain or
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:22.340]   running a temperature, but you're feeling desperate. And your doctor tends to take the
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:30.460]   same view and calls in another and a higher opinion. Now I wonder whether anybody would
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:39.180]   like to put up the proposition that in such a condition, in such a state, that what you'd
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:46.940]   really like to have is a discussion and a debate on the rival possibilities. And you
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:52.820]   take it in this lighthearted way and look at this proposition and criticize it and evaluate
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:00.500]   it and put up another and so on. And the whole thing is done in this light and comparatively
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:07.300]   carefree attitude. The answer of course is that all of us would abominate that. We'd
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:14.580]   say my life is in jeopardy. This is no time for debate and discussion. I want to know.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.380]   I want to have some certainty. I want the thing dealt with. I want to be cured. I want
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:26.060]   to be put right. It would be desperately serious because of its urgency. And of course you'd
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:34.940]   be perfectly right. Well now if that is the case with regard to physical health and well-being,
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.860]   how much more so should it be the case when we're discussing the ills and diseases of
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:52.540]   the soul and a man's eternal destiny? I can't emphasize this matter too much. I think this
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:59.860]   comes as a rebuke to all of us. And we who are Christians need to be reminded of this
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:10.840]   quite as much as do people who are not Christians. So often we discuss theology in a light manner,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.500]   in terms of debate as such, as if we were handling something that is quite apart from
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.140]   our lives and our own well-being and eternal destiny. But it isn't. We're always involved
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.260]   in this if we really believe what we claim to believe and what we say we believe. So
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:37.580]   that I'm arguing that these matters should never be dealt with in terms of a debate or
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:46.260]   in the atmosphere of debate and discussion. They're too serious and too solemn. But then
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:53.100]   thirdly and supporting all this of course, there is a sense in which such a debate or
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.380]   discussion or dialogue is impossible and that is because of the ignorance of the natural
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:06.820]   men. The thing I was referring to yesterday afternoon. I maintain that the man who is
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:15.660]   not a Christian is incapable of entering into a discussion about these matters. And that
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:22.780]   of course for this good reason that he is blind and in a state of darkness. The Apostle
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:28.380]   Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 2 14 that the natural men receive us not the things
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:34.980]   of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know them for they
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:43.300]   are spiritually discerned. He is entirely lacking in spiritual understanding. The whole
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.660]   argument of 1 Corinthians 2 is that these things are spiritually discerned. They're
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:56.020]   spiritual truth. They're put in spiritual terminology and language and they can only
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:04.540]   be understood by the mind that is already spiritual. The other man, says Paul, is incapable
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:10.420]   of doing this. Very well then, if he is incapable of doing this, how can you have a discussion
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:17.860]   with him? In other words, there is no neutral point at which the Christian and the non-Christian
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:26.740]   can meet. There is no common starting point as it were. Our whole position is the very
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:32.580]   opposite and antithesis of the other and is a complete condemnation of it. So that the
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:39.460]   very positions in which we find ourselves, I argue, makes a discussion or a debate of
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:45.900]   these matters quite impossible. I go on to the fourth point which drives that home and
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.460]   enforces it by saying this, that what the natural man needs above everything else is
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:16:00.460]   to be humbled. And this is absolutely essential before we can do anything with him at all.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:06.780]   The ultimate trouble with the natural man is his pride. Again, you get that worked out
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.460]   in the second half of the first chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:19.180]   The wise and the scribe and the disputer of this world. And the Apostle's argument is
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.900]   that what God does to this man is not to have a discussion with him but to make him look
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:30.940]   foolish. He's got to be turned upside down. He glories in himself. Whereas the position
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:37.340]   is that he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord. So that the first thing that has
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:44.420]   to be done with the man who does not accept the Christian faith is to humble him. It is
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:51.060]   the first essential. Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? Or as our Lord himself
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:59.460]   put it, except you be converted and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:07.540]   into the kingdom of heaven. That's a very vital statement. It's a controlling statement.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:15.940]   It applies to all men. All men have to be converted and become as little children. All
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.820]   they know and all they are and all they have and all they've done is utterly useless in
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:29.420]   this realm. And there is no hope for them until they become aware of their utter bankruptcy
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:35.980]   and become as little children. Well, you therefore don't sort of debate or discuss these matters
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.660]   with them on an equal standing as it were and make this assumption concerning them.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.580]   Indeed, our Lord went further, you remember, and uttered these words. I think the, oh Father,
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.180]   Lord of heaven and earth, that thou wast hid these things from the wise and prudent and
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:58.540]   thus revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. This is
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:05.820]   a revelation. This is illumination that the spirit alone can do. And therefore I say that
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:13.020]   this whole notion of having a debate or a discussion or an exchange of views is something
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:20.060]   that runs contrary to the very character and nature of the gospel itself, the theme which
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.980]   we are handling. Now, I reject all this and say that there is only one way. It is the
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:32.580]   way that was adopted by the apostle Paul himself in Athens. I've already quoted it. Whom ye
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:41.860]   ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. This declaration is essential. It must come
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:49.140]   first. There can be no profitable exchange until this declaration has been made and people
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:59.740]   have been given a certain amount of information. And so it is my contention that this declaration
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:09.500]   is something that we, the church, the preacher alone can do. And that this is the first and
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:21.300]   the primary thing that he must do. Very well. That leaves just one further argument or objection
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:28.500]   to this. And that is the argument that that may be all right in theory, but that people
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.740]   will not come to listen. So what you do then? It's all very well to put up this wonderful
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:39.460]   case, but people won't listen to this sort of thing these days and are not interested
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.220]   and so on. And that they insist upon having their right of speech and putting forward
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:49.020]   their views and so on and so forth. Well, I shall be dealing with this, I trust, later
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.060]   on when I come to consider the congregation that listens to the preacher. But let me just
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:20:04.140]   say this at this point. The answer is that they will come and that they do come when
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.300]   it is true preaching. I've adduced evidence from history already that the world was done
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:17.780]   so in the past. And I argue that it is still the same today for the reasons I gave yesterday,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:23.220]   that God is still the same and man is still the same. And if we argue along these lines,
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.900]   it's indicative ultimately of the fact that we have very little place for the Holy Spirit
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:35.340]   in our artwork upon this whole matter. Now, this may be slow work, and it often is. It's
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:42.460]   a long-term policy. But my whole contention is that it works, that it pays, and that it
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.460]   is honoured and must be because it is God's own manner. It's a God's own method. It's
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.700]   the thing to which he calls us. It's the thing to which he thrusts us forth. And therefore,
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:59.340]   he will honour it. And I am asserting that he does honour it and still honours it in
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:05.020]   this modern world. And that finally, you can try all these other methods and schemes, they
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:11.700]   will come to nothing. And you will be driven back to this ultimately. This is the method
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   by which churches have always come into being. You see it in the New Testament, and you see
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:26.980]   it in the subsequent history of the church working in this present world. Very well.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:36.380]   But all that you see has led us repeatedly to this same point. What is preaching? I say
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:44.980]   that when it is true preaching, people will come and listen to it. So that I'm stating
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:53.060]   in other words, is what is preaching? And this, of course, is a very vital question
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:22:03.500]   for us. And I want to address myself to it now immediately. My position is that most
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:09.340]   of these problems with which we've been dealing and most of these situations and difficulties
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.940]   that have arisen and which are causing such concern, and rightly so, to those who are
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:20.220]   in the church, I'm arguing that they're all ultimately due to the fact that there has
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:28.620]   been a defective view of preaching, and therefore defective preaching. I don't think the pulpit
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:34.620]   can escape responsibility for this. If the people are not attending places of worship,
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:42.300]   I hold the pulpit primarily responsible. The tendency is, of course, to blame other factors,
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   the two world wars. At one time, we were told that poverty was the explanation, and that
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:54.380]   you couldn't expect people who haven't enough food and inadequate clothing to come and listen
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:59.020]   to preaching. Poverty, we were told, was the great obstacle. But of course, by today, we
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.460]   have been told that affluence is the great problem, and that the people is the people,
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.260]   and the problem is now that people are so well off and have got so much of everything
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.980]   that they don't see the need of the gospel. You see, the moment you begin to try to explain
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:17.180]   these things in terms of circumstances and so on, you always lend yourself ultimately
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:25.300]   in some such ridiculous position. My contention is that it is the pulpit that is ultimately
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:33.100]   responsible, and that when the pulpit is right and the preaching is true, that it will attract
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:39.340]   and draw the people to listen to its message. And if I may say again what I said yesterday,
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:45.500]   I do not think that there has been an era in the history of the world, generally for
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:52.140]   a long time, when the opportunity for this is greater than it is in this present troubled
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:59.700]   modern world. Very well. What then is preaching? What do I mean by preaching? Let's look at
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:07.380]   it like this. There are men standing in the pulpit and speaking. There are people sitting
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:17.140]   in pews or seats and listening. But what's happening? What is this? Why does that man
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:23.100]   stand in the pulpit? What's the object? Why does the church put him there to do this?
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:29.300]   Why do these other people come to listen? What's this man meant to be doing? What's
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:35.940]   he trying to do? What ought he to be doing? Now, it seems to me that these are the great
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:43.340]   questions. We mustn't rush to techniques and methods and things like that. It's because
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.740]   these preliminary questions have not been asked and faced that I think people get bogged
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:54.700]   down in all these details and discussions. This is the big thing and the controlling
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.500]   thing. What is this man doing there? Well, I suggest that a true definition of preaching
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:07.900]   must say this, that that man is there to deliver the message of God and the message from God
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:17.860]   to those people. If you prefer the language of Paul, he is an ambassador for Christ. That's
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:26.220]   what he is. He's been sent. He's a commissioned person. And he is standing there as the mouthpiece
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:36.780]   of God and of Christ addressing these people. In other words, he is not there merely to
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:44.900]   talk to them. He's not there merely to interest them. He's not there to entertain them. He
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   is there, and I want to emphasize this, to do something to those people. He's there to
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:26:04.060]   produce results of various kinds. He's there to influence these people. Now, not in merely
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:11.820]   a part of them. He's not merely to influence their mind or only their emotions, disturb
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:20.500]   and stimulate their emotions, or merely to bring pressure to bear upon their wills and
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:27.980]   to induce them to some kind of activity. He's there to deal with the whole person. And his
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:35.780]   preaching is meant to affect the whole person at the very center of life. And there is a
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:45.100]   sense in which preaching should be something that makes this difference to a man who's
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:55.500]   listening, that he is never the same again. Preaching, in other words, is a transaction.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:05.100]   It's something for the soul of man, for the whole of the person, the entire man. And it
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:15.820]   deals with him in this vital and radical manner. I remember a man saying to me a few years
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:29.060]   back, he was making a remark about some little studies of mine on the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:36.180]   which I had deliberately printed and published in sermonic form. Now, there were many who
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:43.180]   didn't like that. People don't like sermons. There are people who abominate sermons. And
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:51.660]   I was often pressed to turn my sermons into essays, give it a different form. But I was
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.980]   most interested when this man I was talking to, and he's a very well-known man in Great
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:05.140]   Britain, he said, "You know," he said, "I like these because they speak to me." And
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:13.180]   then he went on to say, he said, "I've been recommended many books by many learned preachers
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:18.780]   and professors and others." But he said, "You know, those other books, what I find in them
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:24.260]   is this, it's professors writing to professors. They don't speak to me," he said. "But,"
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:29.140]   he said, "your stuff," he said, "it speaks to me." Now, he was an able man and a man
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.620]   in a prominent position, but that is how he put it. I think there's a great deal of truth
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:40.100]   in this. That he felt that so much that he'd been recommended to read was very learned
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.580]   and very wonderful, but as he puts it, it was professors writing to professors. This
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:51.980]   is, I think, a very important point for us to bear in mind when we read sermons and so
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:57.300]   on. I was adverting the other afternoon to the danger of the literary style being given
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:03.020]   too much prominence. I remember reading an article in the literary journal some five
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:09.940]   or six years ago, which I thought was very illuminating because that was making the complaint
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:18.660]   there in that realm, that the difficulty was that instead of getting true literature today,
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:24.820]   what you tended to get was reviewers writing books for reviewers. These men review one
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:30.580]   another's books, so that when they write, what they've got in their mind is the reviewer
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:36.700]   and not the public, as it were, for whom these books should certainly be designed at any
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.820]   rate in the first instance. And that tends to come in in this whole matter of preaching.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:48.980]   In other words, I maintain it should be a transaction. Something is taking place. It's
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:55.580]   not the mere imparting of knowledge. There is something much bigger than this. The total
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:05.540]   person is involved on both sides, and if we fail to realize this, our preaching will be
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:15.820]   a failure. Now, shall I enforce this particular point by quoting to you from a pagan philosopher
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.420]   who certainly saw this point very clearly with regard to philosophy? I'm going to quote
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:27.620]   to you from Epictetus. A young philosopher went to him for advice, and he gave this advice,
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:34.180]   which I think is very good advice also for preachers. He said, "The philosopher's lecture
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:41.660]   room, gentlemen, is a surgery. When you go away, you ought to have felt not pleasure,
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:48.620]   but pain. For when you come in, something is wrong with you. One man has put his shoulder
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:56.540]   out, another has an abscess, another a headache. Am I the surgeon then to sit down and give
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:03.900]   you a string of fine sentences, that you may praise me and then go away? The men with the
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   dislocated arm, the men with the abscess, the men with the headache, just as you came?
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:19.180]   Is it for this that young men come away from home and leave their parents and their kinsmen
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:28.820]   and their property to say, 'Bravo to you for your fine moral conclusions'? Is this what
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:36.500]   Socrates did, or Zeno, or Cleomphus?" Now, I think that's most important. You see, he
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:42.540]   says this is true even of the philosopher. He's not discussing abstract problems and
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:51.940]   questions. Even philosophy should be concerned with men, with living beings, and with problems
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:58.900]   and with conditions. Here it is, he says, these people come with something wrong with
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.980]   them. One man's put his shoulder out, another man has an abscess, another a headache. And
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:11.220]   this is true. It's always true of every congregation. These people don't come just as minds or as
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:18.060]   intellects. They come as total persons. In the midst of life and all its attempts and
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:24.780]   circumstances and its problems and its difficulties and its trials. And the business of the preacher
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:32.020]   is not only to remember that, but to deal with it. That he's dealing with living persons,
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:36.660]   people who are in need and in trouble, sometimes not consciously, he's to make them aware of
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:44.940]   it and to deal with it. It's this living transaction. Or take another statement made by the same
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:51.700]   Epictetus. Tell me, he says here, here's his question, his challenge to the philosopher,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:59.620]   equally good challenge to the preacher. Tell me who, after hearing your lecture or discourse,
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:08.620]   became anxious about or reflected upon himself. That's the test. If people can listen to us
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:14.860]   without becoming anxious about themselves or reflecting on themselves, we haven't been
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:20.860]   preaching. Or who, as he went out of the room, said, the philosopher put his finger upon
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:28.700]   my faults. I must not behave in that way again. I think this is an excellent statement of
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:35.180]   it. That is what preaching is meant to do. It addresses us in such a manner that it brings
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:41.900]   us under judgment and it deals with us and we feel our whole life is involved. And we
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.780]   go out saying, I can never go back to live just as I was before. This has done something
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.340]   to me. It's made a difference to me. I am a different person as the result of listening
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:34:01.980]   to this. And he says, if you don't do this, the utmost praise you get is when a man says
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:10.380]   this to another. That was a beautiful passage about Xerxes. And the other says, no, I like
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:17.980]   that best about the battle of Thermopylae. In other words, you see, nothing has been
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.980]   done to them at all, but they're sitting in a detached manner and in judgment. One likes
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:27.980]   this quotation. The other likes that incident out of history. It's been a matter of entertainment,
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.700]   very interesting, very attractive, very stimulating, perhaps for the intellect, but it's done
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:40.060]   nothing to them. And they go out just praising this or that aspect of the preacher's performance
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:45.420]   and nothing has been done to them at all. Well, no, to me, that is what preaching is
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:54.300]   not. Preaching is that which deals with the total person. And a man becomes involved and
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:01.420]   he knows that he's being dealt with and addressed by God through this preacher. And something
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:07.260]   has taken place in him and in his experience, and it's going to affect the whole of his
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:15.980]   life. Very well, then. There it is in general. But what exactly is this man doing? That's
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:23.020]   the object, that's the purpose. But what exactly is he doing? Now here, I think we've got to
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:33.260]   draw a distinction between two elements in preaching. There is, first of all, the sermon
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:41.420]   or the message, the content of that which is being delivered. But secondly, there is
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:49.020]   the act of preaching, the delivery, if you like, or what is commonly called preaching.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:59.740]   It's a shame in a way that this word preaching is not confined to this second aspect. But
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:09.260]   let's call it the act of delivering this message. Now, I'm concerned again to emphasize this
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:18.780]   very real distinction between the message and the imparting of the message, of the delivery
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:28.940]   of the message. Let me try to show you what I mean by this distinction. I remember hearing
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:38.700]   once about a very well-known old preacher in Britain who, preaching in a certain place,
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:44.220]   the local ministers went in to see him after the evening service and they put him a question
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:50.860]   that is so often put to preachers. These preachers asked him, "Who's the greatest preacher you've
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:37:00.620]   ever heard?" And his reply was very important. He put it like this. He said, "I don't know
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:09.020]   that I can tell you who is the greatest preacher I've ever heard. But I can tell you this for
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:16.140]   certain. The greatest preaching I've ever heard is the preaching of John Hutton." Now,
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:21.180]   I'm concerned about this distinction. You see, when he's asked who is the greatest preacher,
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:28.060]   he felt that it was a too inclusive term, all inclusive, the person of the preacher,
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:34.540]   character, his sermon, and so on. And there he found it difficult to come down and say
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.340]   that one man was superior to all the others. But with regard to the matter of preaching,
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:45.820]   as he put it, this deliverance, this act of communicating this message, he had no doubt
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:52.380]   at all. It was this particular man, John A. Hutton. Now, that's the kind of distinction
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.740]   I'm drawing between the message and the act of delivering it. Or take another one.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:08.060]   I remember reading about great men toward the end of the 18th century,
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:15.980]   drawing a distinction between two very great evangelical preachers in that century. One
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.900]   of them was George Whitefield, who was as famous in your country here as he was in Britain,
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.860]   and one of the greatest preachers of all time beyond any question. But there was another
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:37.660]   preacher in Great Britain of the name of Daniel Rowland, and he was a contemporary of Whitefield
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:44.060]   and lived some 20 years after Whitefield. Another great preacher, another great orator.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:52.780]   And this man was being asked to evaluate the difference between Whitefield
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:39:03.500]   and Daniel Rowland as preachers. And what he said was this. He said, as regards the oratory,
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:12.620]   as regards the delivery, as regards the act of preaching, as regards the soaring to the heights
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:20.460]   and lifting up the congregation with them, he said, "I really could detect very little difference
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.860]   between them. The one was as good as the other." He said, "The one big difference between them
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:33.900]   was this, that you could always be certain of getting a good sermon from Rowland,
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:41.340]   not always from Whitefield." Now there you see comes out exactly this same distinction.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:51.980]   You can get good preaching and great preaching with a poor sermon. It's a real possibility.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:59.580]   I shall be referring to this in another connection at some other time. But all I'm concerned to do
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:06.300]   now is to show that there is a very vital distinction between these two elements in what
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:13.100]   this man is doing in the pulpit. A sermon which he's prepared and then the act of delivering
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:20.860]   this sermon. Another way perhaps we could illustrate it is this. A man came, I think it was
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:27.180]   here in Philadelphia actually, on one occasion to the great George Whitefield and asked if he might
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:33.660]   print his sermons. And Whitefield gave this reply. He said, "Well," he said, "I have no
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.820]   inherent objection if you like," he said, "but you know, you'll never be able to put
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:44.220]   onto the printed page the lightning and the thunder." He said, "That cannot be put into print."
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:53.020]   You see, and that's the distinction, the lightning and the thunder. And to Whitefield, this was of
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:58.940]   very great importance. And it is of very great importance as I'm hoping to show you. You can
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:07.420]   put the sermon into print, but not this lightning and thunder that comes into the act of preaching.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:14.780]   Very well. Now then, here is our basic division of the matter. So we've got to start with the
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:25.100]   sermon. And once more, I have again to divide it into two sections. As regards the sermon itself,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:35.900]   you have first of all the content, the message. And secondly, you have the form of that content
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:45.740]   or the form which you give to the message. Once more, a most important distinction.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:54.700]   We are only dealing with the sermon at the moment. Its content, the form which you give to the
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:42:02.140]   content. The control, now we start with the content. What is it that determines the content
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:08.620]   of our message, of our sermon? And I suggest to you that a very good
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:17.900]   text of scripture which focuses attention on this particular point is the famous statement made
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:24.940]   by Peter, you remember, as he and John were walking into the temple one afternoon at the
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.980]   hour of prayer and were suddenly confronted by the impotent men at the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:36.220]   These men looked at them expecting to receive alms of them. He'd received alms of many people.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.100]   That was what the world could do for him. It couldn't heal him, but it could help him to live
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.500]   and to exist and to improve his lot somewhat and give him a certain amount of comfort. They gave
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:51.660]   him alms. And he looked at these two expecting to receive something of them, but he didn't receive
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:43:01.580]   it. And Peter puts it like this to them, to the men, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:11.180]   have, give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." What is this message?
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:21.020]   Well, there's a negative aspect to it. Certain things we are not to do. Certain things which
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:27.580]   we are not equipped to do. But then there is this special thing that we are equipped to do,
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:34.940]   we are called to do, and we are enabled to do it. Very well. I'm only putting it in those terms
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:41.580]   in order that it may be convenient for us to remember it and because it dramatizes the thing
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:49.020]   in our minds. Very well, then what are our principles? Well, here, first and foremost,
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:55.740]   the message of the sermon is not to consist of topical comments.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:02.700]   In other words, we are not to talk to the people about the events of the week,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.500]   things that have happened, things that have caught the headlines in the newspapers,
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:15.900]   political matters, or anything you like. There is the type of man who obviously depends upon
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:23.500]   what he reads in the newspaper for his message on Sunday. And he just makes comments on this,
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:34.620]   topical preaching, topical comments. Other men seem to rely almost entirely upon their reading,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:41.580]   some of them almost on their reading of novels. And the last novel they've been reading, they
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.060]   tell the people about it and about its message and try to give it a moral application or a moral
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:53.740]   twist at the end. I remember a woman journalist who used to write to a certain weekly religious
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:59.020]   paper in England writing about what she, the man she described as her favorite preacher,
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:04.460]   and she told us why he was her favorite preacher. And the reason she gave was this,
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:10.700]   he always shares his reading with us. And you're familiar with the type of thing to which I'm
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:17.340]   referring. Then there are others who seem to think that a sermon is a moral essay
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.820]   or some kind of disquisition on ethical principles
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:28.940]   and an appeal and a call and an urging to a certain type of ethical behavior.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:35.580]   This is all under the negative heading. This is what we don't do.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.420]   Then to others, the message is to be one of general uplift,
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:50.700]   you know, a kind of psychological treatment. It may use Christian terminology, but it evacuates
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:56.460]   them of its real meaning. The terms are used to do something psychologically to people,
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:02.860]   to make them feel happier, to make them feel better, and so on, to teach them how to face
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:11.260]   the problems of life, positive thinking, so on. You're familiar with all that class of
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:19.740]   what passes for preaching and for sermons. And then coming to a more intellectual type
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:29.660]   under this negative heading still, speculative thought, philosophizing, playing with ideas,
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:35.500]   trying to meet the modern men at his own level and trying to get a message that is
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:43.340]   adequate for him living in this atomic age and so on. Well, now I suggest that all this is
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:49.180]   entirely wrong. This is not the business of the men who stands in the pulpit.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:53.820]   Why not? Well, the world can do that. There's nothing special about it.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:02.140]   I put that under the category of silver and gold. The world does that, the world can do that.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:10.300]   But this is not the result that has been committed to us. And in any case,
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:16.620]   while again, I'm not saying that the effect of preaching should not be to make people happier,
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:23.820]   it should, as I say, it affects the whole person. But all these effects which arise in that way
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:31.020]   are incidentals or they are results or they're consequences of the message preached
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:38.620]   and not the message itself. Now, when I come to the actual construction of a sermon, I shall
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.380]   go out of my way to show that we must always show that the sermon is relevant.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:48.300]   But there's all the difference in the world between showing the relevance of the message
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:55.420]   of God's word and preaching a topical sermon. This is to be incidental. It isn't central,
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:02.300]   it isn't primary. That's the sort of thing that the world in its ethical and philosophical and
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:10.300]   social clubs and societies can do. But it is not the thing to which the preacher is called upon to.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:18.620]   Well, what is it? Well, coming to the positive side and using this analogy of Peter and John
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:23.740]   with the men at the beautiful gate of the temple. What is the message? Well, it is such as I have.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:33.500]   I haven't got the other. Not my province, not my business. I'm not competent to do that.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:40.700]   But such as I have. I have got something. Something has been put into me. Something
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:47.820]   has been committed to me. I do possess something such as I have. That I give to thee.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:56.700]   Now, the way in which the apostle Paul puts this is this. I delivered unto you first of all
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:05.260]   that which I also received. This is the thing that determines the message of the sermon as such.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:13.740]   It is that which the men has received. Or take again this term ambassador. This brings it out,
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:21.100]   I think, very clearly. An ambassador is not a man who voices his own thoughts or his own opinions
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:29.820]   or his own views or his own desires. The very essence of the position of the ambassador is
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:36.380]   that he's a man who's been sent to speak for somebody else. He is the speaker for his government,
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:41.900]   for his president or his king, his emperor or whatever it may chance to be.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:50.460]   He's not a man who speculates and gives his own views and ideas. He is the bearer of a message.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:55.660]   He's commissioned to do this. He's sent to do this. And that is what he must do.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:07.180]   In other words, the content of this sermon is what is called variously in the New Testament,
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:16.300]   the word, preach the word or preach the gospel, the whole counsel of God,
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:25.420]   which being interpreted, of course, means the message of the Bible, the message of the scriptures.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:33.820]   Now, what is this message? There it is. It's limited to that. This is what we've received.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:39.100]   This is what I've got, such as I am. I've received this. There it is for me.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:44.700]   I don't bring my own thoughts and ideas. I don't just tell people what I believe.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.180]   I deliver this to them. I've been given it and I give it to them.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:54.620]   I'm a vehicle. I'm a channel. I'm an instrument. I'm a representative.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:51:07.020]   Very well, it is this. But obviously, we see at once that this is divided into two main sections.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:15.580]   And I believe it's very important that we should recognize these two main sections
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:21.420]   in the message of the Bible. The first is what you may call the message of salvation,
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:30.220]   which determines evangelistic preaching. And the second is the teaching aspect,
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:36.620]   the building up of those who have already believed the edification of the saints.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.660]   Here is a major division which we must always draw.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:49.980]   And I suggest that this must be a controlling factor in our preparation of our sermons and of
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:58.700]   our messages. What do I mean by this first division of message of salvation, evangelistic
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:04.700]   preaching? Well, I think you've got a very perfect summary of this in just two verses.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:13.180]   In the first epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians in the first chapter and in the last two verses,
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:19.580]   verses nine and 10, Paul reminds these Thessalonians of what it was that he had
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:24.460]   actually preached to them when he first came amongst them. This is what brought the church
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:30.380]   at Thessalonica into being. He says, "They themselves show of us what manner of entering
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:37.260]   in we had unto you and how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:42.380]   and to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus,
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:49.100]   which delivered us from the wrath to come." It's a perfect summary. He gives another summary of it
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:56.700]   in his farewell address to the elders of the church at Ephesus, who came down to meet him as
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:02.060]   he was going up to Jerusalem by the side of the sea. There's a wonderful account of it in Acts
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:09.980]   chapter 20. And he reminds them. He said that this was his preaching and he'd done it from house to
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:16.940]   house by day and by night with tears. What was the message? He says, "It was the repentance that is
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:25.420]   toward God and the faith that is toward the Lord Jesus Christ." Now that's the apostles own summing
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:36.220]   up of this message. For our purposes, we can put it like this. This type of preaching is a great
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:45.420]   proclamation of the being of God, how he turned to God from idols to serve the living and the true
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:55.820]   God. Evangelistic preaching has this great content. It is this declaration. You see, you get
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:00.540]   it everywhere in the New Testament. That was the very thing he was doing in Athens. "Im declare I
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:06.860]   unto you." This preaching about God, contrasting him with the idols, exposing the emptiness and the
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:13.500]   acuity of idols and so on. And then of course, it comes on to a preaching of the law.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:20.860]   The character of God leads to the law of God, God's whole relationship to the world and to men.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:28.620]   All this is designed to bring these people to a conviction of sin and to lead them to repentance
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:38.460]   and that in turn to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:44.700]   message of salvation. That is what is called evangelistic preaching.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:52.540]   But then there is this other side which is teaching, building up of the saints. And I
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:59.900]   would subdivide this into two sections. That which is more primarily experimental
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:03.660]   and the other which is instructional.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:15.500]   Now, I haven't time to open this out to you now. I shall do so as we get on to the more
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:22.380]   practical parts of this discussion. But fundamentally, I am suggesting that this man
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:31.020]   in the pulpit should have that kind of twofold distinction in his mind, but he must subdivide
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:35.580]   the second into these two sections, the experimental and the instructional.
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:43.500]   In other words, I am saying that this preacher should be as it were three types or kinds of
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:51.500]   preacher. There is a preaching which is primarily evangelistic, which I personally always did on a
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:59.500]   Sunday night, invariably. There is a preaching which is instructional teaching, but it's
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:08.380]   experimental. That I generally did on a Sunday morning. There is a more directly instructional
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:15.900]   type of preaching, which I personally did on a weeknight, generally on a Friday night.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:23.180]   Now, I'm very concerned to say that you mustn't press these distinctions into absolute
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:29.900]   essence. But for the general guidance of this man in his preparation of his message,
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:35.900]   it is good to think of it, if you like, in that threefold way. Preaching to those who
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:43.260]   are unbelievers, then preaching to your believers in this experimental manner and in this more
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:51.100]   directly and boldly instructional manner. Well, very well. We'll leave it at that for this
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:58.620]   afternoon and for this week. And we'll be able to take it up from there and see how this man
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:05.660]   relates the total message of the Bible to these three particular types of presentation.
