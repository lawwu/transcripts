[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about your dynamic safe withdrawal rate in the retirement
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.520]   Because interest rates have gone up
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.620]   Your safe withdrawal rate has gone up and the reason why is because the formula that I have offered to the world
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.980]   the financial samurai safe withdrawal rate formula equals the 10-year bond yield times 80%
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.600]   So as the 10-year bond yield goes up
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960]   So does your safe withdrawal rate and vice versa?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.560]   And if you think about it, it makes a lot of sense
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.080]   the 10-year bond yield is the risk-free rate of return and it encapsulates the state of the economy you can write
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.120]   Thousands and thousands of words on the 10-year bond yield, but it is the single most
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.360]   Important economic indicator you should follow because it's the risk-free rate. It is a reflection of where
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.700]   Inflation is heading or where inflation is right now
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.920]   it reflects the state of the employment market and it also discusses where the bond market thinks the economy is heading as
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.320]   A investor who is willing to risk his or her assets to make money and probably lose money on occasion
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.560]   The 10-year bond yield is so important because you would not invest in any other asset if there wasn't an equity risk
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.960]   premium and that equity risk premium is the difference between your
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.380]   Expected market returns and the risk-free rate of return the 10-year bond yield
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.760]   So if you expect an investment to generate a 10% return and the risk-free rate of return right now is 3%
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.160]   Your equity risk premium is 7%
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   So you might be wondering where did I come up with my formula the 10-year bond yield times 80%
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.080]   Well, it comes from history
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.020]   back in the
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.900]   1990s the 4% rule became very popular and the 4% rule states that if you withdraw at a 4% rate
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.700]   You will unlikely run out of money over a 30-year time frame and back then
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.940]   You know people were retiring at around 60 and the median life expectancy was under 80
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.740]   So in other words if you follow the 4% rule you would unlikely run out of money by the time you
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.140]   Passed away what I found very fascinating when I was studying the 1990s and when the 4% rule became more popular
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.980]   Was that the risk-free rate of return the 10-year bond yield was at 5% to 6%
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.020]   Therefore, of course, you would never run out of money if you're withdrawing at 4% because you could earn
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.300]   risk-free money at 5% plus
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.700]   I'm honestly not sure why nobody in this world is talking about this reality
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.640]   But since someone has to talk about this reality
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.300]   It might as well be me and you don't need a PhD
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.220]   To understand that you're not gonna run out of money if you can earn a higher risk-free rate or return
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.420]   So 4% is 80% of 5%
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.380]   That is how I came up with my safe withdrawal rate formula of the 10-year bond yield times 80%
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.660]   so if you believed in the 4% rule back in the 90s and
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.820]   2000s and 2010s then you should believe in the logic of the financial samurai safe withdrawal rate formula and
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.300]   to be frank I
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.800]   Created this formula to be simple to be very logical
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.140]   But also to poke fun at the 4% rule and why everybody just thinks that's the gospel rule
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.100]   Things are forever changing folks since the 1990s inflation and interest rates have come down
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.820]   We invented the internet. We're texting instead of writing letters to loved ones friends and family
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.980]   So it's important to adapt with the times and I promise you that you will be happier and wealthier
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.140]   if you are more dynamic in your thoughts and in your actions if you don't believe me identify the
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.700]   unhappiest person, you know
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.700]   Chances are high. They are very set in their ways
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.100]   They're rigid and thought and in action and that means a lot of opportunity
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:16.540]   Has and will pass them by part of my responsibility as a financial educator is to ensure that as many people
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.180]   Understand what I'm saying what I'm writing. Otherwise, I'm failing, you know
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.580]   I was a high school tennis coach for three years and
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.700]   If my students didn't understand my instruction or I couldn't get through to them or motivate them or make them feel confident
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.980]   I was failing as a teacher. So I do believe no
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.220]   Buddy should be left behind and I'm trying my best to explain this concept to you
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.460]   So, please take some time to understand the formula and also to listen to a couple of examples
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.580]   I want to give to you right now. Here are two formulas just to listen to you
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.780]   Don't have to understand it yet. But here they are one the expected market return equals the risk-free rate
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.420]   plus beta times the equity risk premium and the equity risk premium equals
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.500]   expected market return minus
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.300]   risk-free rate
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.980]   Now logic dictates you would not invest in a risk asset if it didn't provide a greater potential return
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.140]   Than the risk-free rate therefore as the risk-free rate rises and falls
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.280]   So does the expected market return and expected risk premium and these variables are always changing
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.260]   It's not set in stone
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.340]   Which is why when you hear about the 4% rule and you must follow it for the next 30 years
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.140]   It doesn't make sense
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.940]   If you have studied finance or if you're just a normal person who realizes that things are changing all the time
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:52.000]   Let me explain using two examples why the risk-free rate is important when investing. So the first example is real estate investing
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.020]   With the risk-free rate currently at about 2.8%
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.140]   You would not buy property when an expected market return of 2.8% or less
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:07.020]   Why? Because you could lose money in your property further it takes time to manage a physical rental property, right?
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.740]   You've got to find tenants. You've got to deal with the maintenance issues. It can be a hassle if you're unlucky
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.060]   Therefore you look for the highest expected market return above the risk-free rate of return
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.480]   Which equals the equity risk premium from the formula as the risk-free rate goes higher
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.100]   Real estate investors will refuse lower cap rate properties
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.600]   So cap rate think about it as a net rental yield if you have no mortgage
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.900]   This will in turn lead to market softness in those markets with lower lower cap rates
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.340]   Those cap rates are going to increase because investors who are like well
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.740]   Why bother investing in such a low cap rate property now people do that?
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.500]   They've been doing that for decades in big coastal cities where cap rates are lower because of the assumption that
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.540]   principal returns that
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.300]   Depreciation of these properties will more than make up for negative cash flow
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.060]   this investing strategy works well in a bull market because
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.340]   Rising tide lifts all boats things are doing well your cash flow and no big deal if you're making
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.080]   10% 15% on your principal but in a bear market it puts
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.220]   These type of investors more at risk because their cash flow gets crunched and they're not making
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:27.900]   Positive returns on their principal. So when you think about this logic, you'll better understand my real estate investing rule
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.100]   Which is burl
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.500]   Burl by utility rent luxury so the idea is to buy utility those properties with higher cap rates
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.320]   With higher net rental yields and then rent property
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.540]   Those properties in usually bigger cities with lower cap rates, you know
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.220]   It might sound very expensive to spend a hundred thousand dollars on rent in New York City
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.520]   But if the if it costs let's say a 2.5 percent cap rate to buy that property
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:04.100]   Then it's actually a relatively good deal. So in terms of finance money investing you've always got to think about
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.820]   Yin-yang yin-yang a positive is often
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.160]   Counterbalanced by a negative. So for example
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:19.940]   Rates are going up. So this is causing growth tech high beta stocks to go down because there's a higher discount rate which
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.660]   Reduces the present value of its future cash flows
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.540]   however, if you are a retiree who is relying on
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:35.700]   Investment income higher rates is a good thing because you earn higher risk-free investment income and you earn
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.500]   higher dividends and higher bond income and
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.940]   Many other sources of income which will help you live a better life
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.780]   The second example I want to use is investing in corporate bonds and the risk-free rate
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.140]   corporations issue bonds to raise capital for
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.780]   corporations and acquisitions when interest rates are low
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.660]   You'll see more corporate bond issuances because the cost of capital is lower and vice versa
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.400]   When equity valuations are high some companies might issue more primary shares
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.860]   Because they can raise capital a lot more capital when their share price is high again
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.780]   Yin-yang finance
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.500]   so with the risk-free rate at about 2.8 percent a
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:21.060]   Corporation would need to issue bonds with a coupon rate higher than 2.8 percent
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:27.980]   Otherwise, it may have a hard time attracting capital that they want since investing in corporate bonds has risk
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.880]   corporations could default on their bond payments or go
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:38.780]   Bankrupt if you believe inflation and interest rates will decline and the market hasn't yet priced in this likelihood
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.560]   Then you are even more excited to buy some bonds today
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.980]   For example, the corporate bond you purchased yielding 5% today will look more attractive if the risk-free rate
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:56.780]   Drops to 1.5 percent in one year versus 2.8 percent today. So again, everything is relative
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.700]   there is something interesting for everyone to think about and that is when
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:07.700]   Bond prices go up Treasury bond prices go up or when the government issues Treasury bonds with a higher interest rate
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:13.740]   It effectively starts crowding out sources of capital that private companies could get
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.340]   So if you put on your economist hat and investor hat
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:24.580]   Raising rates too quickly or seeing the bond market sell off too quickly to see higher Treasury bond yields
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:31.700]   For example can be detrimental to the economy because if you crowd out so much of the limited capital
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.540]   You could say capital is unlimited because we print unlimited amounts of money
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.300]   But let's just say that capital is limited for most institutions and people
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:49.180]   The government starts attracting all this capital and then companies can't get that capital to pay salaries to hire to acquire
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.740]   To grow to innovate and that is how you see the economy slowing down. So I hope that kind of makes sense
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.980]   It's just a battle for capital battle for talent, you know companies go through battle for resources in this finite world
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.460]   Everything is competitive and everything moves up and down with a variable price now
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.900]   Let's move on to a situation where my dynamic safe withdrawal rate
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.020]   suggest
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.500]   Increasing your withdrawal rate in a high inflation and negative return environment
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   That's kind of like what we're experiencing right now and conventional wisdom is saying well, you should lower your safe withdrawal rate
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.700]   Because it'll reduce your wealth quicker now that it makes sense
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.780]   If you've started with a high withdrawal rate in the first place
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.260]   So if you're stuck if you've been stuck on a 4% 5% withdrawal rate, yes lowering it makes sense
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.460]   But you're not stuck if you follow my recommendation because it's dynamic
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.100]   When you know the market was collapsing in March and April of 2020
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:58.500]   The dynamic safe withdrawal rate said well lower that withdrawal rate to 0.5%
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:06.140]   and by so doing you can invest more of your money in the market to take advantage of the sell-off or
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.740]   You can just raise more cash
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.860]   It makes sense during times of uncertainty and it depends on you
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.900]   But unfortunately, I was bonked over the head by this type of thinking so in this current environment of high inflation
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.940]   Negative returns at least in the stock market
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:27.220]   I say you continue to follow the safe withdrawal rate formula that I've proposed and
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:33.620]   Really the answer does depend on your timing risk tolerance your ability to generate supplemental retirement income
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.900]   What is more important to you? Do you have a working spouse that I know a lot of
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.420]   Male readers do have who say they're retired. They they say yeah, you know
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.300]   I can raise my safe withdrawal rate because my wife continues to work and pay for health insurance
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.740]   Everybody's situation is different
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:56.140]   But let's go through this logic if you are willing to invest more when you know times are bad
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:03.220]   In other words, you have a lower safe withdrawal rate and you're buying stocks and real estate in 2020
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:10.700]   Then logically you should be willing to spend more when times are good or not yet that bad
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:18.700]   So right now we're still up over 60% from stock market bottom in 2020 and we've only seen a 10
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:25.980]   Plus percent correction in the S&P 500 so things are not going up, but they're not that bad to me
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.740]   It is way better to enjoy your money rather than see it disappear in a bear market
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.500]   And here's a very important point if you don't spend your money when things are good
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.980]   then you most likely won't spend your money when things are bad and
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.540]   If this is the case you will more than likely die with too much money
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.940]   And that would be a darn shame and a big big waste of time
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.020]   Unfortunately, I see this happen all the time
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:59.020]   Retirees who've spent 40 years saving and investing they can't change their ways
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:05.100]   So they continue to save and invest for a future that is quickly going to come to an end
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.980]   It's kind of sad, but we need to recognize our mortality. I have this frugality disease problem myself
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.220]   I have t-shirts that have holes in them pants that have holes in them
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.980]   I wear shoes for many many years also with holes in them because I'm kind of lazy
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:27.620]   But I also yeah, I don't I don't like spending money that much but I'm trying I'm trying because I'm entering the decumulation phase
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.460]   At the end of this year because I'll be 45 years old and I don't think I'm gonna live
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.300]   Far past 80 85 years old if you are a retiree right now
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:45.020]   What's more important is your income and not your net worth even if your net worth temporarily declines by 25% in a bear market
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.620]   It's gonna suck. It won't feel good to be frank
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.300]   So long as your net worth is generating a similar amount of income, you're gonna be fine
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.020]   but if your income declines by 25%
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:03.420]   You may have to reduce your lifestyle and living your best lifestyle in retirement is the end goal. Never forget the end goal
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.840]   So there is one risk to your investment income and that is during a protracted bear market
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.260]   If a bear market lasts for far longer than a year
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:20.100]   Chances increase dividend payout ratios may get cut property rental yields may decline as you
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:28.220]   Can't rent out your rental properties for as much or as long there might be more vacancies bond yields may also decline
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:35.780]   So this double whammy of declining principal values and declining investment income hurts retirees the most so you might be wondering
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.940]   What are you gonna do? Well, I think most people would lower their safe withdrawal rate
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:46.380]   That makes sense because you're trying to prepare yourself or just stop the hemorrhaging as much
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.300]   however, the beauty of the financial samurai safe withdrawal rate formula is that it will
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:58.820]   Automatically generate a lower recommended safe withdrawal rate in such a scenario because this is a bad scenario, right?
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.020]   We're going back to let's say March April 2020 a lot of uncertainty
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:09.460]   Recession all that stuff. So it'll naturally get you to withdraw less and spend less
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.260]   So the bottom line here is don't overthink things
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.820]   You don't have to overthink things because the 10-year bond yield and
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:24.040]   Encapsulates so much of what our economy is going through and so much about future expectations
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.180]   That's why being dynamic
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:32.020]   Is so important having a dynamic safe withdrawal rate formula is so beneficial
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:37.860]   And even if you follow the logic and the formula, you don't have to stick to it 100%
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:43.060]   It's a guide to help you through the ups and downs of life because there will always be ups and downs
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.100]   Now in addition to following a dynamic safe withdrawal rate formula
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.260]   I recommend trying to be more dynamic in other areas of your life
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:59.300]   Some examples include getting good at a sport a musical instrument or type of art meet new friends outside of your socio-economic
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:05.180]   Level meet new friends who are different in sex race culture beliefs learn another language
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.620]   Nima ha read all types of history take up a new hobby
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:18.140]   Interview people outside your circle. I promise you with a more dynamic thought process with more dynamic
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.380]   Actions you will have a more rewarding and happier life
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.940]   You will be able to bend when bending is required and not break
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:34.660]   You will be able to see different perspectives that were on once unfathomable because you were so set in your ways
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.580]   I hope this episode has better helped explain why I believe
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.900]   My safe withdrawal rate formula is superior to sticking to a fixed withdrawal rate in retirement over time
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.820]   If you haven't let go of a steady paycheck then do a test drive by living off various withdrawal rates
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:57.940]   You might discover you're fine with a much higher withdrawal rate or you might feel that drawing down principle feels
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:05.140]   Too terrible as a result, you'll find fun ways to generate supplemental retirement income to keep your withdrawal rate low
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:13.420]   The truth is folks you won't know how you will really feel about drawing down capital until you no longer have a job
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.300]   therefore
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:21.820]   Expect the unexpected. Thanks everyone for listening. If you enjoyed this podcast, please subscribe share
