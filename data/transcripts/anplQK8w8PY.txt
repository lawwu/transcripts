[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.540]   This is not just the fact that you think a little bit differently about theology and life.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.300]   This is a change that literally alters your mind.
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.200]   You're renewed in the spirit of your mind, not just your mind.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.620]   You might think that's just kind of how you think on the surface.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.960]   So the Holy Spirit goes deeper than that.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.480]   The spirit of your mind, all the way down to the fountains of your comprehension and your reason.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.420]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.900]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:01:01.020]   We come now to Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.020]   We are going through the book of Ephesians, and we are in chapter 4 again, verses 17 to 24.
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.020]   And I'm going to read it, and then we're going to look again at these wonderful words of divine revelation.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.240]   "So this I say and affirm together with the Lord that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.980]   also walk in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.700]   from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.500]   their heart.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.240]   And they, having become callous, are now in the midst of a great trial.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.740]   And they, having become callous, are now in the midst of a great trial.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.240]   And they, having become callous, are now in the midst of a great trial.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.740]   And they, having become callous, are now in the midst of a great trial.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.000]   And they, having become callous, are now in the midst of a great trial.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.320]   have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620]   greediness.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.500]   But you did not learn Christ in this way; if indeed you have heard Him and have been
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.420]   taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus."
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.960]   That in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.860]   being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.140]   spirit of your mind and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.660]   in righteousness and holiness of the truth."
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.420]   Now we here have a comparison between the people before salvation and the same people
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.840]   afterward.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.980]   Before salvation - and this is true of all unconverted people - they walk in the futility
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.800]   of their mind, darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, ignorant, hard-hearted,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.080]   callous, given over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.580]   Verse 22 says, "This former manner of life is one that is being corrupted in accordance
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.720]   with the lusts of deceit."
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.100]   The diagnosis of everyone prior to salvation.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.900]   When salvation comes, as noted in verses 20 and 21, everything changes.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.980]   Verse 23 says that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, put on the new self, which in
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.800]   the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.600]   The difference is the salvation that is the theme of verses 20 and 21.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:40.120]   So as we come back to Ephesians, chapter 4, let's go look at it again.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   We are seeing something that is consistent with the way salvation is described in Scripture,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.840]   both in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.160]   Now Paul begins in verse 17 by saying that we no longer walk as the Gentiles walk.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.480]   We can't live the way we used to live.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   We can't.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   It's not right, and it's not even possible.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   Did you get that?
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.820]   It's not right, and it's not even possible.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.360]   We don't walk as the ethne, as all human ethnicities walk.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.160]   We don't live the way they live.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.480]   We aren't characterized by the things that characterize them.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.860]   Now let me just say as a footnote, the descriptions of people before they're converted in Ephesians
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.360]   2 and 4.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.580]   Sound extreme, and they are extreme.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.240]   It doesn't mean that everybody lives those out to the maximum extreme possibility of
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.520]   evil.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.620]   Not everyone is a mass murderer.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.600]   Not everyone is a serial rapist.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.260]   Not everyone is like that, but everyone falls into those categories to one degree or another.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.080]   It's only a question of degree, not nature.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.240]   So not everybody is as bad.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.840]   Not everybody is as bad as they could be, but everybody falls under the same definition.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.400]   And the main issue is indicated in verse 18.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.460]   "All of this is true because they are excluded from the life of God.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.400]   They do not possess divine life.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.240]   They do not possess the life of God."
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.960]   Mark that, because that is very, very, very important.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.780]   That's part of them being dead in trespasses and sin, the absence of the life of God.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.660]   But again, back to verses 20 and 21, you see the picture of salvation, learning Christ,
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:54.240]   being taught about Him, the truth in Jesus, which is the gospel, direct reference to salvation.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.500]   And in that saving work, I want you to see what happens.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.840]   In that saving work, Paul uses the word "saving."
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   He uses three infinitives to reveal the nature of the transformation, three infinitives.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.260]   One is in verse 22, "Lay aside."
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.560]   The next is in verse 23, "Be renewed."
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.840]   And the next in verse 24, "Put on."
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.420]   Three infinitives to reveal the essential nature of this transformation.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.880]   It is a laying aside.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.720]   It is a putting on.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.020]   It is a being renewed.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.580]   This is not exhortation, by the way.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.600]   These three infinitives describe the transformation by God, the Holy Spirit, through the saving
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.920]   gospel of Jesus Christ in the life of a sinner.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.940]   This is the work of God.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.660]   Now look at verse 22.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.600]   In reference to your former manner of life, you laid aside the old self.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.640]   This is a reality.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.560]   You laid aside the old self.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.120]   What is the old self?
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.420]   What you were, the composite of your invisible nature.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.380]   Why did you lay it aside?
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.920]   Under the power of God, because you heard the gospel, and you were taught the gospel,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.480]   and you saw it as the truth, and you believed it.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.440]   God opened your mind, opened your heart, gave you life, gave you understanding.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.560]   A divine miracle took place.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:49.220]   You heard the gospel, you learned the gospel, and you laid aside the old self.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.940]   That's a powerful statement, very powerful statement.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.200]   You laid aside the old self.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.360]   Then in verse 24, "You put on the new self."
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:08.560]   This is transformation, and this is what salvation is.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:15.420]   It isn't that when you were saved you were repaired.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.840]   It isn't that when you were saved you were realigned.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.760]   It isn't that when you were saved you have an old self, and added to the old self is
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.240]   now a new self, and so you have the old self and the new self.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.100]   Competing, no.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.580]   You put off the old self.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.900]   You put on the new self.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.520]   The old self is not repaired.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.220]   It's not realigned.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.060]   It's removed.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.640]   It's removed, and it's replaced.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.280]   This is very, very important for you to understand.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.120]   If you are a true believer, this is what has happened to you.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:08.940]   This is an amazing thing for us to understand.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:18.300]   In the language of Ephesians 4, "You have put off the old self, put on the new self,
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.440]   and are renewed in the spirit of your mind."
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.480]   You don't think the way you used to think.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.000]   You could parallel that with having a new heart and a new spirit.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.640]   It's not just that God treats you differently.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640]   You are different.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.400]   You're a new creature.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:51.980]   Colossians 3:10 says, "You have been literally created in a true fashion to be like the image
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.700]   of the One who created you."
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.720]   This is not a psychological change.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.880]   This is not just the fact that you're a new creature.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.660]   This is the fact that you think a little bit differently about theology and life.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:12.800]   This is a change, Ephesians 4, that literally alters your mind.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.560]   You're renewed in the spirit of your mind, not just your mind.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.800]   You might think that's just kind of how you think on the surface.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.660]   So the Holy Spirit goes deeper than that, the spirit of your mind, all the way down
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.760]   to the fountains of your comprehension and your reason.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:37.120]   I read an article this week that said, after a survey of 600 pairs of Christian parents,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:44.520]   that 4 percent of Christian parents have a Christian worldview.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:51.880]   Four percent of parents who say they're Christians have a Christian worldview.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.260]   You know how I feel about surveys to start with.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.640]   But you're trying to tell me that 96% of Christians have a Christian worldview.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:07.940]   96% of people who have been created anew, who have been given new life, who are the
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:14.500]   possessors of eternal life, who in the words of 2 Peter 1:4 are partakers of the divine
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:25.240]   nature, those who possess everlasting life, those who have been renewed in their minds.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.520]   You're telling me that 96% of them see the world the way they see it?
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.600]   The way they saw it before?
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.540]   Not possible.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.740]   Now they may not know all the elements of Scripture that help them understand and discern
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:48.780]   everything in the world, but to say 4 percent of Christian parents have a biblical worldview,
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:59.400]   you better check your definition of Christian, because when you were saved, you better know
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   everything.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.120]   You put off the old self.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:10.140]   You put on the new self by the power of God, and deep down in your mind you were transformed,
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:17.520]   and you don't think the way you used to think about anything.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.920]   The new self.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.980]   Ephesians 4 says, "In the likeness of God."
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.280]   In the likeness of God.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:37.720]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2:16, "You have the mind of Christ."
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:48.700]   I think Christ has a biblical worldview, just saying.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:59.160]   So there in that fourth chapter of Ephesians, we are told that we have been created in righteousness,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:07.940]   in holiness of the truth, and in the very likeness of God.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.700]   This is the total transformation.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.360]   Again, it's not addition.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.560]   You aren't what you used to be, and something was added to it, and now you've got a war
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.280]   between what you were and what you are.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   No.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:29.040]   Your inner person, your inner man, your new self replaces the old self.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   Now, I know what you're thinking.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.820]   You're thinking, "But wait a minute.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.420]   I'm doing a little inventory, and I have to confess that I sinned."
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.300]   And I'm glad you did.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.860]   But how do I understand that?
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.780]   How am I to understand that?
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.900]   This seems really black and white.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:56.040]   So let's go back to Romans 6, and I want to help you with that.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   Romans 6.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.920]   We say, "Well, I'm not going to do that."
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.440]   I'm glad to hear that.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.760]   But what about sin?
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.180]   Paul will not locate sin in that new self.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:15.620]   In chapter 6 of Romans, verse 12, Paul says this.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.560]   Verse 11, "Consider yourselves to be dead to sin, alive to God."
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   That's the creation.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:28.800]   "Do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you may obey its law."
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   That's the creation.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   That's the creation.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.680]   Paul locates sin, not in the new self, but in the mortal body, the part of you that is
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   not eternal, the part of you that is material and mortal.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.760]   And he always is careful to do that so that the reality is this.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:57.780]   You are a new creation, partaker of the divine nature, possessing eternal life; you just
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.680]   happen to also be a part of the new creation.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   You are a new creation.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680]   Now, I want you to notice the careful language of Paul.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   Go to chapter 7 of Romans.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   We're not surprised at all.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   He says, "For the Lord is a God of the heavens, and He is the Lord of the earth."
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   Now, I want you to notice the careful language of Paul.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.680]   Go to chapter 7 of Romans.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   He says, "For the Lord is a God of the heavens, and He is the Lord of the earth."
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   Now, I want you to notice the careful language of Paul.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   Go to chapter 7 of Romans.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.680]   We're not surprised at all.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.620]   Now, I want you to notice the careful language of Paul.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:27.800]   Go to chapter 7 of Romans.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:37.280]   We're not surprised at all if we come down to verse 14, and we read this from Paul, personal
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.520]   testimony.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.680]   We know that the law is spiritual.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.560]   In fact, he says back in verse 12, "The law is holy, the commandment is holy, righteous,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   and good."
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   He knows that.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.860]   We know the law is spiritual.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:56.380]   But I am of flesh sold into bondage to sin.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:03.440]   He locates the sin issue in the flesh, which is like the mortal body of chapter 6.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:11.740]   And this is how it reveals itself: "What I'm doing I do not understand, for I am not
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.800]   practicing what I would like to do, but I'm doing the very thing I hate; if I do the very
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.440]   thing I do not understand."
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.220]   "What I do not want to do I agree with the law, confessing the law is good."
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.220]   Something's wrong.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.680]   I don't like it.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.900]   I am a new person.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.600]   I am a new creation.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.140]   My physical death will be less of a change than my conversion was, because I've already
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.940]   been fit for eternal heaven, because I've been given eternal life, which is the life
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.700]   of God.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.680]   So why is there all this struggle?
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.320]   So in verse 17, notice how Paul distances his new sin.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.420]   He says, "I am a new self from it."
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.820]   So now no longer am I the one doing it.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.240]   No, the new I says the law is spiritual.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.340]   The new I says the law is holy, the commandment holy, righteous, and good.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:08.940]   And maybe he says with David, "Oh, how I love your law."
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:17.200]   So it's not I doing it but, verse 17, sin which dwells in me.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.800]   Sin's still around.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.080]   Verse 18, "I know nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh."
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   There we go.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.840]   It's in the mortal body.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.260]   It's in the flesh.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.400]   Your mortal body and your flesh is dying.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.500]   Amen?
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   Correct?
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.640]   This is the part of you that still bears the curse.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.080]   And it shows up, "Because the willing is present in me," that's the new self, "but the doing of it
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   is not.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.780]   For the good that I want I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.160]   I'm doing the very thing I do not want.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.900]   I'm no longer the one doing it."
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.900]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.020]   He says, "It's not the real me."
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.340]   Now he's not being irresponsible.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:14.380]   He's just parsing out spiritual reality and saying, "Sin is so alien to me.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.960]   I hate it.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.660]   It's not what I love.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.660]   It's not what I want.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.000]   It's not what I desire.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.280]   But it's still there in my mortal body, in my flesh.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.220]   That's where it resides.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.720]   So I find in verse 21 the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   good.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.800]   "For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man."
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   There it is.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   There's that new self.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.840]   "But I see a different law.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   Where is it?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.240]   It's in the members of my body.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.860]   It's in my flesh.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.640]   It's in my mortal body.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.020]   And it wages war against the law of my mind and makes me a prisoner of the law of sin,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.020]   which is in my members."
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.560]   Again, he keeps saying, "It's not me.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.040]   It's not the new self.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.240]   It's not my heart.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240]   It's not my new heart.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.340]   It's not my new spirit.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.360]   It is in my flesh.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.380]   It is in the members of my body.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.720]   It is in my mortality.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:24.400]   It is in my members, my fleshly mortal faculties."
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:34.360]   Verse 24, he shows his frustration by saying, "Wretched man that I am, who will set me free
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.660]   from the body of this death?"
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.520]   And again, he says, "It's the body."
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.200]   In ancient times, very often when somebody killed someone, as a punishment, they would
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.600]   take the murdered corpse and strap it to the murderer.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.900]   It wouldn't take long before the body decayed and brought about a horrendous death to the
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.280]   killer.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.560]   Paul feels that way.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:04.000]   He is full of divine life, but there's a corpse strapped to him.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.480]   Now, he knows he'll triumph, so he says it in verse 25, "Thanks be to God through Jesus
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.220]   Christ our Lord.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.480]   He will free me from death.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.160]   He will free me from this corpse.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.100]   He'll free me from this corpse."
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.600]   But notice how verse 25 continues, "Not yet.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:35.600]   So on the one hand I myself with my mind, my renewed mind, am serving the law of God,
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.760]   but on the other with my flesh the law of sin."
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.060]   It hasn't happened yet, right?
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.340]   I know it will happen.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.860]   I know Christ will deliver me.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.080]   I know someday it's going to happen.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.360]   Someday I'm going to get rid of this sin.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.600]   I'm going to get rid of this wretched sin that attaches itself to me.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.140]   And oh, by the way, in chapter 8, verse 1, "I know it's not going to condemn me, for
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.700]   there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.680]   Why will we never be condemned if we're in Christ?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:12.640]   Because Christ was condemned in our place.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.240]   And so we struggle, and we will struggle all our life.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   We'll struggle all our life long.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.480]   Sometimes young people say to me, "Do you ever get victory over besetting sins?"
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.860]   Sure, as you grow in grace and the knowledge of Christ, you'll sin less.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:35.560]   But I warn you, though you sin less, you feel worse.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:43.680]   Paul has this horror of sin because his inner man is righteous, and he sees sin against
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.120]   that backdrop.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:53.520]   Any Paul and any believer is far more sensitive to sin than an unbeliever, because an unbeliever
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.620]   has nothing to compare it to.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.200]   Unbelievers don't fight the battle with the flesh.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:13.920]   They're all flesh, and the old self and the flesh are very compatible partners.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.000]   So the good news is you will sin less.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.500]   You will sin less as you grow, but you'll feel worse, because the less you sin, the
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.940]   more you become like God, the more you hate sin.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:36.360]   And in your maturity, you will hate your own sin a lot more than somebody else's.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:43.640]   So Paul recognizes the reality of sin, and he knows there's going to be a triumph.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.880]   When is that triumph going to come?
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.240]   Go to chapter 8, verse 23.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:23:02.200]   Verse 22, he says, "All of creation is groaning under the curse."
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:08.660]   Verse 23, "We ourselves, having the firstfruits of the Spirit, because the Spirit is in us,
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:13.760]   and the Spirit has dispensed into that new inner self - love, joy, peace, gentleness,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   goodness, faith, meekness, self-control.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.600]   We have the Spirit.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.780]   We have those.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.020]   We have the divine nature.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.120]   We have eternal life, the life of God in our souls.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.720]   We are the temple of the Trinity.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:34.820]   Because of all of this in the new self, we groan within ourselves.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:42.040]   There's an agony in living, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   What do you mean, Paul?
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.640]   I mean the redemption of what?
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   Our body.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.240]   And again, that's all that we need.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.260]   We've already been transformed.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:01.060]   When you die, it's not a transformation of your inner person, it's the subtraction of
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.400]   your sinful flesh.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:15.520]   When you see a casket lying in a coffin - I know they all always dress people up.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:29.640]   But what you're really seeing is nothing but flesh, nothing but mortality, nothing
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:43.400]   but the occupying part of humanity that holds sin and fights against the new self.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   So we rejoice.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:52.580]   We rejoice when someone goes to glory, not only because they're in heaven, but because
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.780]   they've left the body behind.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.320]   And there will be in the future a new body, a resurrection body, right?
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   First Corinthians 15.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.280]   It will be like His glorious body.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   There will be no battle in heaven between the glorified body and the glorified soul.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:27.080]   So we are waiting, he says in verse 23, eagerly for the redemption of our body.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.100]   When you think about heaven - and we've sung about heaven this morning - when you think
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:37.200]   about heaven, it's not so much about seeing Aunt Alice, although you might be able to
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.500]   find her up there if she's there, and it's not so much about the beauty and the splendor
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.160]   of it.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.420]   Because it is that the struggle with sin is over.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.640]   It's over.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.280]   It's over, the redemption of the body.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.740]   In the meantime, this is how we need to think about ourselves.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:05.540]   We need to think about ourselves as new creations created in the likeness of God, in the image
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.600]   of the One who created us.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.540]   We have in our salvation been enabled by the Holy Spirit to put off the old and put on
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.040]   the new.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.520]   We have a renewed mind.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:24.540]   We now love righteousness, holiness, and truth.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.800]   But how do we gain victory?
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:37.920]   How do we get the upside of the struggle between the new self and the flesh?
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   Well, I think, first of all, you have the power to do it in the resident Holy Spirit,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.400]   right?
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:52.600]   And in the power of that new life, which is created in righteousness, holiness, and
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   truth.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:27:01.300]   The power is in the very essence of that life and in the Spirit who dwells within you.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:07.340]   You also have the additional power that comes from the Scripture, "Your word have I hid
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.040]   in my heart that I might not" - what?
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.360]   "Sin against you."
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.520]   You have that new nature.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   You have the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.800]   You have the Word of God.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.480]   But I'll tell you what it comes down to.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.820]   It comes down to obedience.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:31.840]   Sanctification is in the power of the Spirit, by the power of the new creation, by the power
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:40.020]   of the Word of God, a believer obeying the commands of Scripture.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.680]   That's why Jesus said what He said in His final words.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.500]   That is the path of sanctification.
