[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   I think of protein quality in terms of quality of protein, meaning the type and ratios of
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.440]   amino acids, the availability of those amino acids relative to the amount of calories one
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.740]   has to ingest to get them.
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.360]   Because frankly, I've grown tired and slightly irritated at the, oh, you know, these plant
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.080]   based foods have a ton of quality protein in them.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.500]   And I go, really, you have to consume 2000 calories of that plant or grain in order to
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.400]   get the equivalent amino acid profile from, you know, a four ounce piece of steak, for
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.760]   instance.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.880]   And this is not an argument that animal proteins are better ethically.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.740]   I'm just saying at a quality as a function of calories ingested, I feel like animal proteins
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.340]   are superior.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.140]   But tell me, tell me what the data say.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.880]   Sure, sure.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.300]   Man, this is a lightning rod of a, of a topic here.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.760]   This, uh, um, we have a strong audience.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.560]   They can handle it.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.100]   They can handle it.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.800]   All right, you guys, guys, buckle up, brace yourselves, please.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.900]   So gram for gram, as a group, animal proteins are higher quality.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.740]   They're more anabolic.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.780]   They have a higher proportion of essential amino acids.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.280]   They have a higher amount and proportion of the anabolic driving, the most anabolic driving
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.240]   amino acids, the branch chain amino acids, leucine specifically.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.200]   And, uh, in, in the majority of the literature, when you compare animal versus plant proteins head
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.700]   to head, you see greater muscle protein synthesis.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.820]   Um, now with muscle protein synthesis being sort of the short term indicator of what might indicate
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.620]   a growth trajectory over time, we have to see if we can corroborate that with these longitudinal trials
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.500]   where you drag the experiment out for weeks and months to see if there's any superiority with the animal
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.940]   versus the plant protein for kind of where the rubber meets the road, which is increasing muscle mass
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.120]   and or strength.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   So there have been a lot of studies comparing animal versus plant proteins and
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.320]   interestingly, uh, okay, so the animal proteins do have the edge in that department.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.440]   And that's been reported in a couple meta-analyses now.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.500]   Um, uh, one of them compared whey and soy and didn't find a staggering difference between the two
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.860]   anabolic leap, so we can call soy actually a high quality protein, but when you look at the individual
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.380]   studies there, it way still has an edge in terms of because meta-analyses just like take the data
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.700]   and cram it all together into a single conclusion.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.940]   And so, um, it's also important to look at the individual studies too.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.240]   So here's where the story gets interesting.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   There, there are two studies now that compared a, and this is what, what's been
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.560]   missing from the literature.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.760]   Usually we take two groups of omnivores and we supplement them with, let's say, whey protein.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.960]   And then we supplement the other group with, uh, some sort of a plant protein.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.760]   Like pea protein.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   Yeah, pea protein.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.840]   And interesting thing about pea protein, it actually outperformed whey in one study.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.440]   So in this 2015 study where pea protein supplementation outperformed whey for increasing muscle thickness.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.080]   It was really sad.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.460]   It was, I was really sad to see that because I was weighing it up and I was like, oh God,
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.540]   God, yeah.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.540]   Well, what are we doing here?
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.100]   It is what it is.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.740]   That study has not been replicated, but okay, so the interesting part, we finally have studies
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.620]   where we're looking at completely vegan regimen, a group who's totally vegan, no, no animal products
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.900]   at all in, in the diet versus an omnivore group and, uh, put them on a resistance training regimen, 12 weeks.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.700]   This was, uh, done by Lorraine and colleagues.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   And this was like a few years back.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:06.980]   And so they optimized protein, or at least made it at the bottom of optimal at 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day in both groups.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.260]   And so, but the unique thing about this study, it was the first time ever we're comparing vegans with omnivores.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:24.060]   So there were no significant differences between groups in muscle size and strength gains by the end of 12 weeks where they were put on a progressive resistance training program.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.420]   It was isocaloric, so isocaloric meaning, uh, for those that don't know what that means is total number of calories ingested per day.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.260]   Same in the vegan versus omnivore group.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.300]   Yes, that's right.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:43.180]   Isocaloric, isomacronutritional, you know, isoproteic, everything, everything is equated between the groups new macronutrition wise.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.460]   No significant differences in the size and strength gains.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.020]   And, um, they're suspecting, oh, and by the way, the vegan group, their protein intake was boosted.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.100]   It was boosted up to 1.6 grams per kilo or 0.7 grams per pound.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.700]   It was boosted up by a soy protein supplementation.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:12.580]   So, apparently, I mean, we're beginning to see that at a dose, a total daily protein at 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight,
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:20.660]   the totally vegan group was able to hang in there against the omnivore group for muscle size and strength gains,
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.140]   at least within the conditions of the study and at least for those 12 weeks,
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.980]   and at least for the, uh, the subjects that, that were used who weren't necessarily, you know, these high level athletes or, or, yeah.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.820]   So you can, if you construct it properly, you can follow a vegan diet as long as you get 0.7 grams per pound of body weight.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.340]   And the weird thing, man, is the vegan diet overall had significantly less essential amino acid content.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.660]   Hmm.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.340]   And significantly less branched chain amino acid content.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:01.860]   But, apparently, the resistance training stimulus is robust enough to make protein effects, ah, almost secondary.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.900]   Interesting, um, getting right back to exercise probably being the major lever in, in everything.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.020]   Oh, well, sleep, I would argue, is the major lever, uh, over time.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.900]   I, I would agree, man.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.380]   But, I will say this, because then people think if they get one bad night's sleep to not train.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:26.740]   I don't know if you're familiar with these recent studies showing that you can offset the inflammation that arrives from getting five or fewer hours of sleep the previous night.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.140]   With training.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.860]   With exercise.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.860]   You just don't want to get into a habit of it.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.180]   So, um, but if you're-
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.220]   Easier said than done.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.540]   I know.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.060]   If you're on the fence about whether or not to train because you're sleep deprived, train.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.300]   But don't do that more than one to two days per week, ideally.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.340]   And even better would be to get great sleep and train, but-
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.540]   I know you're, you're gearing up to, to hit, hit the next thing.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.660]   I, I want to mention that this study I just talked about was not a one-off.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:02.180]   A couple years later, Monteen and colleagues did the same thing, but they used mycoprotein for the vegan group.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.140]   Mycoprotein.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.860]   It's a fungus-based protein.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:14.660]   So you've seen that, that, um, that, that I think it's on, is it on Netflix or HBO, The Last of Us, where that fungus makes people anabolic?
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.420]   I haven't seen that.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.380]   That's what this is.
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.100]   It's based on this.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.740]   I'm doing a joke about a fictional show.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.620]   Some, some of the audience will, will chuckle or just think I just busted the most terrible dad joke ever.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.460]   But, um, it's a fungus-based protein.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.020]   Uh, commercially it's called corn.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.940]   So Q-U-O-R-N.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.420]   Okay.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:41.380]   It's one of these weird, uh, types of products that is unfortunately expensive.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:52.580]   And, um, so the plant-based or the animal-free group, their protein intake was boosted with this mycoprotein.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.860]   And then they were compared against omnivores with mixed, mixed protein sources.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:08.340]   And by the end of the study, I believe it was a 12-week study, no differences, no significant differences in increases in muscle size and strength.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.980]   And they, you know, progressive resistance training regimen.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:17.060]   Once again, not necessarily highly trained people, but we basically saw the same thing.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:28.820]   As long as total daily protein is where it needs to be, then apparently the, the animal-free group can hang with the omnivores, at least for the conditions of that study.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.940]   So I, I always look at these things skeptically.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:43.700]   Um, but the mycoprotein also outperformed milk protein for muscle protein synthesis in this acute study that preceded this longitudinal study.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.020]   And so there's some weird stuff that we can look at aside from animal protein that could be just as anabolic.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:58.100]   Um, so yeah, that, that's the story with animal versus plant and/or fungus-based protein.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.220]   And so, so yeah, I just, I just had to throw in the, the montine.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.420]   That's very interesting.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.580]   You know, I think when people hear soy, you know, there's been this, you know, kind of assault on soy for years.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:17.460]   And, um, and I've, I've avoided it, not for any specific reason, but because I prefer other sources of calories.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.100]   Um, I like meat and berries and eggs and this kind of thing.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:29.780]   Um, but it's interesting that some of these engineered proteins and soy protein and pea protein, when you really put them to the test under the right conditions,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:37.300]   you know, they seem to gram for gram, they seem to, uh, to perform just as well as the animal proteins.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.940]   You did mention, however, that satiation, uh, satiety rather is a key factor.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.220]   So I'd be curious in this study, I don't know if they measured this, whether the people in the vegan group
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:54.900]   felt that they were, um, happy with what they were eating as compared to the animal protein group.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.140]   You know, at the end of the day, are they still craving more food?
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.660]   Do they feel, um, like they desperately want a ribeye steak?
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.500]   In order to follow a fairly strict diet of any kind, but in particular, plant-based,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.380]   one has to have a good reason.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.780]   You know, I, I think that otherwise you, you just kind of fall into the, the availability issue.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.180]   You know, it's a lot easier to fight to eat an omnivore diet.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.380]   Um, that wasn't measured in either of the studies.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.860]   And I always look at these things skeptically when you used essentially untrained subjects,
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:36.100]   because untrained subjects are always going to kind of incur this newbie gains effect
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:43.060]   for the training regimen where the, the gains that you get from the resistance training alone
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.420]   are going to just mask any potential advantage of either protein type.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:55.540]   And so, um, you know, people would, well, Stu Phillips will argue with me on that all day long.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.780]   We did a two day long, uh, Twitter argument about that.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.220]   You spend two days on an argument on, on X?
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.340]   Like Stu is a, is a fricking legend, man.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:12.100]   He is, he is a legend in the protein research area, but he will argue with two to three days on,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.660]   on Twitter.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.580]   And so, you know, we always end up at the same spot where, um, look, we need more research
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:25.940]   to see whether, um, and, and this wasn't about, this wasn't about vegan, uh, versus, uh, animal
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.260]   proteins, plant versus animal, this was about just total daily protein intake period.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:38.420]   Um, we, we just need more research on, uh, highly trained, highly resistance trained subjects
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:46.420]   to see whether, uh, in fact, a completely plant-based protein regimen that's optimized calorically and
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.500]   total daily protein amount wise can really run with, um, the animal based stuff like the,
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.380]   the high quality animal based proteins.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:01.700]   And so, uh, it, it almost depends on where you want to place your bets and, and where you,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.540]   where you want to, uh, take your risks.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.940]   So if you're, if, if gold is on the line at first place at a professional or national level is on the line,
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.380]   yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:16.500]   I don't know if I would, but, uh, everybody's ideology is what it is.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.100]   And some people are just kind of governed by what they want to stick to.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:32.020]   So it really depends on the population and what the goal is.
