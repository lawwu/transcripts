[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300]   So as you recall, just last week, people on Reddit nearly bankrupted a very famous hedge fund.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.200]   They did that by using a strategy that hedge funds have used for years.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.160]   They shorted stock in companies like GameStock and drove them up for that purpose.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.540]   Now, of course, only hedge funds were allowed to manipulate the stock market, so corporations turned to a familiar tool.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.740]   They censored the people on Reddit.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.920]   The online service Discord, for example, accused the Reddit day traders of hate speech.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.240]   And then there were the questions around Robinhood, which was a service they used to conduct those trades.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.540]   All of this is filled with lessons for the rest of us.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.260]   We're not financial experts.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.600]   We're talking to someone now who is.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.060]   David Sachs is a technology entrepreneur, very well known in that world.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.060]   He co-founded PayPal.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.580]   He wrote a really smart piece about the implications of this story.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.100]   You can find it on the online publishing platform Persuasion.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.480]   We wanted to talk to him tonight.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.020]   David, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.180]   So you have the grounding in this world sufficient, I think, to draw informed conclusions,
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.320]   about what happened and what it means for everybody else.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.640]   What have you concluded?
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.500]   Sure.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.520]   Well, Tucker, you've been warning about censorship and the slippery slope when people start to invoke censorship.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.420]   And I think we see it here with Discord.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.120]   You have a case here where some Wall Street traders, their message board was taken down.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.160]   They weren't engaging in political speech at all.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.040]   They were engaging in a plan to give these Wall Street predators a taste of their own medicine.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040]   Because of that, they were very threatening to the people in power,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.160]   and they were accused of hate speech.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   And they were taken down.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   Now, if you were to actually go into these message boards, you wouldn't see hate speech.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.500]   You would see a lot of very raunchy speech, but nothing that's too different than what you'd see on any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.500]   And all of a sudden, these sort of titans of Wall Street are just shocked by the language that's going on here.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   So, you know, look, this is a really good example, I think, of when you strip away sort of partisan issues,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500]   you see that the real purpose of censorship is, as a tool,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.840]   for the people in power to keep the outsiders out.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.920]   I think that's really smart.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.100]   So when they invoke the phrase hate speech, especially, of all the phrases they use, I think it's the scariest.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.560]   Nobody wants to be thought of as a hater or, you know, using hate speech.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.420]   That's an awful thing.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.900]   That's certainly how I feel.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.080]   But what you're saying is they don't employ that in order to protect the weak.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.880]   They use that phrase in order to protect the strong.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.260]   I mean, hate speech is a very...
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.760]   It's a very malleable term.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   And so the people who get to decide what it means, which is really always the issue with censorship,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.760]   is who decides who has that power.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   It's the people in power get to decide what it means.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.260]   And so, you know, you had a case here where, look, these message boards weren't set up for the purpose of organizing hate
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.760]   or even any political topic.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   They were organized to talk about a trade.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.260]   And they, you know, figured out actually a plan that worked perfectly to execute a short squeeze.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260]   And these hedge funds lost $20 billion.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.160]   And so they were...
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   You know, in a lot of trouble, a lot of financial distress, and they were looking for a way out.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   And so the way they found a way out was to go through these message boards.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.660]   They screenshot any posts that could plausibly be characterized as hate speech.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.660]   They report it.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.660]   And then they get the site taken down.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.660]   And so this is kind of where the slippery slope of censorship goes, is that whenever outsiders become too threatening
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.660]   to powerful insiders, the insiders use censorship as a weapon.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.660]   They weaponize these speech rules to prevent the threat.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.660]   So you're making a very traditional liberal argument.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.660]   I mean, you're saying what the ACLU said for about 100 years, what, you know, Nat Hentoff used to write about in The Village Voice.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.660]   Why aren't more people saying that now, do you think?
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660]   More people in power with authority?
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.660]   Well, it's a really good question, Tucker.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.660]   And I think part of it is that a lot of the people in power are frankly threatened by these new social networks.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.560]   And so certainly the traditional media has been very upset with that.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   And so certainly the traditional media has been very upset with that.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560]   And so certainly the traditional media has been very upset with that.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   And so certainly the traditional media has been very upset with that.
