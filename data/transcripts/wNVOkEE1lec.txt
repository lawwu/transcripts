[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   The church is fractured. We've seen that over the past couple of years. We've experienced
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.500]   a lot of division among Christians at the levels of networks and denominations, but
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.580]   also inside local churches and among friends, too. So is all this division a good thing?
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.040]   Is it only a bad thing? Will division work for the church's greater purity and final
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.940]   good or will division work to the church's final detriment and the lessening of her testimony
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.120]   in the world today? It's a relevant question. It's an important one and it comes to us from
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.780]   a listener named Connor. "Hello Pastor John and thank you for this encouraging podcast.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.540]   I have heard a lot from fellow Christians recently about the sadness of the church being
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.980]   so divided with all its disagreements, splitting local churches and denominations and even
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.540]   old friends. Division is everywhere." While there's much to be sad about in much of this,
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.380]   especially given Jesus' emphasis on his desire that his disciples be unified in love, I have
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.740]   been wondering whether some of the divisions in the church today are good, even necessary
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.980]   as a means to distinguish the sheep from the wolves, something Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.100]   11 19. But can we distinguish healthy from unhealthy divisions in the church? Some big
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.340]   issue divisions seem obvious and good, but other divisions seem petty and insignificant.
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.540]   What do you think of the disagreements in the church today?
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.140]   Well, there's so many ways to come at this. Let me come at it like this. The point that
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:47.540]   I would like to emphasize about the divisions in the church is this. Don't make light of
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:02:00.420]   it and don't make death of it. It is tragic, but it is ordained. It is possible to speak
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.220]   about disunity and division as though they were a small thing, which would be a mistake.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.900]   Making light of it is a mistake. Just listen. John 13 34, "A new commitment I give to you,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.980]   that you love one another, just as I have loved you. You also are to love one another.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.340]   By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:39.700]   That's a very convicting text. Lovelessness among Christians is not a light thing. John
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.500]   17 21, Jesus prays, "I pray, Father, that they may be one, just as you, Father, are
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.700]   in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.180]   you have sent me." Ephesians 4, "I urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.020]   to which you've been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:15.860]   one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.740]   One more, 1 Corinthians 1 10, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:31.300]   Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.860]   you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment."
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:47.460]   So just a few texts. There are so many more. We simply must not make light of our divisions,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.380]   especially those that are unnecessary for the sake of truth or that are maintained with
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.220]   unloving attitudes and actions. Three things stand out from those passages of Scripture.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.660]   One is that the deepest unity among God's elect is a given. It's a given. We don't
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.420]   create unity. Man doesn't make it happen. When we come to Christ, we are grafted in
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:28.820]   by the Spirit to one body, Jesus Christ, and members one of another, so that the command
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:37.060]   in Ephesians 4 is, "Maintain the unity. Don't create it. Show it to the world."
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.540]   A second thing that stands out from those passages I just read is that the public effectiveness
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:53.780]   of our unity is not at the level of institutional oneness or collaboration, as though the absence
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:02.460]   of denominations would be a compelling witness to the world. Rather, the public effectiveness
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:13.440]   of our unity is when unbelievers see on-the-ground attitudes and acts of love among believers.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.960]   This is where the energy for unity should be mainly expended, I think. Let all bitterness
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.760]   and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:33.240]   Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.700]   That's the level at which the miracle happens. That's the level at which the unbeliever
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.600]   sees and says, "I'd like to be part of that kind of community."
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.560]   The third thing that all these texts either say or assume is that the only kind of unity
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.140]   that glorifies God is unity in the truth. He's a God of truth. "You shall know the
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.780]   truth and the truth will make you free. Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." Paul
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.000]   says in Ephesians 4.15, "Speak the truth in love to one another." For Christ and
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.900]   his apostles, it was inconceivable that one could love another person by throwing away
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:27.260]   truth for the sake of peace. Listen to Jeremiah. "They have healed the wound of my people
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.380]   lightly saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace." The only peace that
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:42.300]   matters is truth-based peace. So when I pray for unity in the church, which I do regularly—little
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.940]   church, big church—I pray, "Oh God, grant us unity in the truth."
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.360]   So Francis Schaeffer at the end of his life said that what the world needs to see is not
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.660]   the Christian church tearing down every fence that was built for the sake of truth, protecting
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:13.940]   truth, declaring truth. Rather, what we should do is stop throwing hate bombs over the fences.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:21.380]   So I thought that was a very effective way. And instead, love each other across genuine
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:28.780]   disagreements, genuine fences. The world, I don't think, stumbles mainly over doctrinal
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:36.500]   disagreements among Christians. It stumbles mainly over the way we treat each other in
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:44.940]   the light of those disagreements. So all of that to say that we should not make light
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:53.460]   of the contentions and divisions in the church. But now let me say, we should not make death
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.820]   of these divisions either. Don't make light of them, don't make death of them. That
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:06.180]   is, we should not have an unbiblical, Pollyanna view of what Jesus and his apostles said would
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.780]   actually come to pass as time goes by in the church. It's not a rosy picture.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.740]   Now, to be sure, this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.820]   as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come, Matthew 24, 14. There will
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:32.060]   be a completion of the Great Commission, and God will gather his elect from the peoples
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:41.580]   of the world. That is the triumph of this age before Christ comes. But the conditions
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:50.540]   of the church and of the world in which the church finds itself while that mission is
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:57.020]   happening successfully is not a pretty picture. One of the texts that Connor mentioned when
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:03.580]   he asked his question is 1 Corinthians 11, 19. "I hear that there are divisions among
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:10.540]   you," Paul said, "and I believe it in part, for there must be factions among you
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized." Now, that is a
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:23.020]   startling statement. It assumes that there is underlying disunity in the church that
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:30.940]   needs to be exposed. He just seems to assume it. Why would Paul assume such a thing? I
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:38.100]   think that assumption goes back to Jesus. Jesus did not paint a rosy picture of the
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:46.900]   climax of history. In God's strange providence, Jesus stated a principle like this, "Woe
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:57.220]   to the world for temptations to sin, for it is necessary that temptations come, but woe
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:04.740]   to the one by whom the temptation, the stumbling, the traps, the deceptions come," Matthew
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:14.260]   13, 7. That's amazing. This is divine necessity. When he says, "It is necessary," he's
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.620]   talking about the way God has ordained for the world to come to its climax. God has willed
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:27.060]   these kinds of troubles. Jesus pictured this kind of inevitable trouble in the parables
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.860]   of the fishing net and the parable of the wheat and the weeds, Matthew 13, 47. Again,
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.700]   the kingdom of heaven is like a net. The kingdom of heaven, the rule of God, the saving rule
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:49.500]   of God is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:56.660]   it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers, but they
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:03.420]   threw away the bad. So it will be at the end of the age, the angels will come out and separate
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:12.880]   evil from the righteous. So the kingdom, the visible church draws into itself unconverted
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.900]   people that the angels will separate out in the day of Christ's second coming. Same
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:24.060]   thing in the parable of the wheat and the weeds. The workers, they wonder if they should
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:31.420]   go out and pull up the weeds that are growing among the wheat. False brothers! Jesus says,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:40.180]   "No, let them grow together until the end," Matthew 13, 30. In other words, Jesus predicted
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:47.780]   that disunity and conflict would be built into the church from the beginning. It is
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:57.180]   necessary that such temptations come. These weeds are not going to keep their mouths shut.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:03.540]   They're not going to keep their opinions and attitudes to themselves as time goes by.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:13.380]   And then in Matthew 24, when the disciples ask Jesus about the signs of the end, Jesus
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:24.460]   says over and over in that chapter how torn the church is going to be with betrayals and
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:31.300]   apostasy. Listen to these words. I'll start reading at verse 4 of Matthew 24. Jesus answered
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:38.940]   them, "See that no one leads you astray, for many will come in my name." These are
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:45.820]   people in the church, in the name of Jesus. People will come in my name saying, "I am
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:52.380]   the Christ." They will lead many astray. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.740]   and put you to death. These are Christians putting Christians to death. "And you will
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:05.620]   be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away and betray one
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:12.500]   another." This is not just trouble from outside the church. Betray one another. Hate
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:19.540]   one another. That's verse 10. Here's verse 11. "And many false prophets will arise
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:30.620]   and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:38.420]   cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved." So we're talking about
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:45.500]   Christians' love growing cold and not enduring to the end. Now that's a horrible description
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:53.700]   of the condition of the church. This is what the church will do to each other. Incredible.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.500]   And the apostle Paul joins this bleak description of the condition of the church in the last
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:06.380]   days. And remember, the last days began in the first century, 1 Timothy 4.1. Now the
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:16.020]   Spirit expressly says that in later times, some will depart from the faith by devoting
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:24.620]   themselves to deceitful spirits. So it's part of prophetic wisdom in the first century
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.420]   that things are not going to end well on the earth. It's going to be bleak. The mission
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.460]   will be done. There will be white-hot Christians to the end, risking their lives and laying
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:43.300]   down their lives to get the gospel to the ends. So I conclude, don't make light of
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.780]   divisions and don't make death—that is, the death of the church—of divisions. They
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:55.180]   are tragic. We should give our lives for the sake of the unity of the church. They are
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:05.180]   tragic and they are predicted. It is necessary that stumbling blocks come, but woe to those
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.780]   by whom they come.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.460]   Don't make light of them and don't make death of them. That's a good word on divisions.
