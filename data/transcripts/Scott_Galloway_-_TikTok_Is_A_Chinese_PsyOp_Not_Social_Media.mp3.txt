[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Even your fully electric VZ4X.

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We make it easy.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Toyota. Let's go places.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Give me your thoughts on TikTok.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I know that you dug into some of the research around that,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   the way that it's been weaponized, and also the impact that it's having on young people.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   So let me just start off by saying I love TikTok.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I think it's an extraordinary product.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I think it was genius to take a platform and say it shouldn't be social.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's not about what your friends think about you.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's not about choices.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   It's not about finding anything you want, like YouTube.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's not about feeling bad about yourself because you don't have a six-pack
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   or you're not as rich as your friends on Instagram.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's about a streaming media platform where there's no choice.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You have one choice.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You tap the logo, and it immediately starts calibrating based on what you like,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   what you swipe up, swipe down on.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And before you know it, you're in the ultimate, tailored, individualized, singular
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   streaming media network that is just addictive.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I could go on to TikTok right now and for a couple hours just watch it.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I think my 12-year-old boy, if he had his way, would disappear into his room
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   with his phone, put diapers on so he could watch TikTok for 72 hours straight
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and not have a bathroom break.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I think this thing is an amazing product.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   The issue is if I were a member of the CCP and I saw that we had vested interests
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   in diminishing America's standing strategically in the world
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and that the easiest way to do that was not with kinetic power
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   because we don't have the capital that the U.S. has to spend
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   on aircraft carrier fleets or even through corporate espionage,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   and they do a great job of that, I would just take my thumb
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and very elegantly and insidiously put it on the scales of content
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   that reflects America in a bad light.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So whether you're Kim Kardashian or Joe Rogan or Jonathan Haidt,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   a lot of your content reflects America in a very positive light.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And a lot of your content highlights the problems we have.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It would be very easy.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I believe they're doing this now.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I think they'd be stupid not to do this and put their thumb
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   on the scale of content that says our elections are being weaponized,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   racism in the U.S. has not gotten better, it's gotten worse,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   that capitalism does not work, that you can't trust your leaders,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and slowly but surely raise a generation of Americans,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   of civic leaders, military leaders, business leaders,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   that feel bad about America and also aren't focused
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   on the human rights violations in China.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But basically, if you think of geopolitics as a horror movie,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   it's not outside threats right now.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   We are stronger than we've ever been, I would argue, competitively.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   No one's lining up for Chinese or Russian vaccines.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Our GDP growth hasn't matched China's, but it's more consistent.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   The smartest, brightest, hardest-working people in the world
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   all have one thing in common, and that is they like the idea
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   of either getting to Europe or getting to the United States especially.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So we're the football team that gets the top draft choices
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   every year from every high school in the world.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So we're doing really well. But the horror movie would be that horror movie
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   where they say the call is coming from inside the house.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We're eating each other in the U.S. internally.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   A third of Republicans and Democrats see the other party,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   members of the other party, as their mortal enemy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   25% of America is comfortable with an autocrat
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   as long as the autocrat represents his or her ideals.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   54% of Democrats are worried that their kid is going to marry a Republican.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And so the fastest way to atomize, or the fastest way to defeat an enemy
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   is atomize them. And I think TikTok, when you have kids under the age of 18
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   spending more time on TikTok than they spend on every streaming media company combined,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   would we be comfortable with Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   all being owned by China? And I don't think we would.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So I think there needs to be a separation between ownership and the product.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I think that Meta was the ultimate espionage product.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I don't think the Mossad, the NSA, the GRU, MI6, and their wildest dreams
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   could have come up with Meta.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And I think we're going to find out that our ability to take out
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   some of these Taliban leaders has been a function of their niece
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   being on Instagram with GPS drone.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And I also realize this sounds paranoid, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I think after the senators and elected leaders in America
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   have their photo ops berating Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   they go into a confidential hearing and he says,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   "Do you want us to continue help killing Taliban leaders?"
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And they say, "Yes." And he says, "Well, back the fuck off."
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I think that's why we haven't had any meaningful legislation
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   against the big American platforms.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But anyways, the ultimate propaganda tool is TikTok.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I just don't-- I think they would be stupid not to do this.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I think we're naive to think that they won't be able to do it easily.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I think we should-- I think it presents a real national security risk.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   The wild thing is that TikTok content that is disintegrating America
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   or reducing patriotic feelings towards it is generated by US citizens.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   In America.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Yeah, this isn't the Chinese creating content.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But because of the dynamic of audience capture
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and the reinforcement mechanism of getting that status response,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   you can press your hand on the scale that rewards creators
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   that create a particular type of narrative,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and that-- it turns every individual TikTok user
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   that cares to talk about politics to be more likely
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   an unwitting, unwilling CCP agent.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's so brilliant and insidious at the same time.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And by the way, let's wrap all of this in really joyous dance videos,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   which makes it all feel really benign.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Even optimistic.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It was done to a Justin Bieber-- the catastrophe and the apocalypse
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   will be done to a Justin Bieber soundtrack, so it doesn't really matter.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It all feel good.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And you don't even have to put your thumb on the scale of certain individuals
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and not others.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It can be the content from the same individual.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   In this podcast, I will talk about very hopeful things for America.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I don't think there's anything wrong we can't fix.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   50% of the world's philanthropy originates from U.S. institutions.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   If you were to have one global headline, news headline for the last 100 years,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   it would be that British, Russians, and the Americans turned back fascism.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   The one headline for the last 50 years would be unprecedented global prosperity
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   led by America.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'll also talk about failing young men in the U.S.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and how they're struggling, and they've never done--
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   young men have never followed-- that cohort has fallen further, faster
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   in the U.S. than in history.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   If you're TikTok and you have a series of 30-second clips
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and you're with the CCP, which narrative do you want to see rolling more often?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And it's just super, super easy.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   They could just take-- they don't need to produce their own content.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   They just need to tweak the algorithm to say,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "In the same 60 minutes, an individual will have pro-
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and anti-American content, and we're just going to slowly but surely
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   dial up the anti-American content."
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's from someone you trust.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's from someone who also has pro-American content,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   so you think their content is credible.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Let's create a lot of doubt about the efficacy of the vaccines
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   when there's thoughtful discourse on both sides.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I would argue 90-plus percent of the thoughtful discourse about vaccines
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   says on a risk-adjusted basis, "You should get a vaccine."
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And then 10% or less is doctors saying, "It alters your DNA."
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   If I'm the CCP and I want to create controversy
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and I want to get us hating each other more,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   let's make that content 50/50.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Let's have everyone go at each other over the vaccines.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So I would say just, quite frankly, if I were them, that's what I would do.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Why spend money on aircraft carriers?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Why compete on 11 playing field when we have this Trojan horse
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   the size of Montana residing in the US
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   and we have this vehicle that the upcoming generation of Americans love
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   in just a few small tweaks and slowly but surely--
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They won't even know-- The movie "The Sting,"
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I don't know if you saw it, with Robert Redford and Paul Newman,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   but the key to a great con is the mark never knows they were conned.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   We're all victims of propaganda right now.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   We all see con on the left and on the right that sways our view,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   but we don't think we've been fooled.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's much easier to fool someone than convince them they've been fooled
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   because to acknowledge you've been fooled is like saying,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   "I acknowledge I'm an ass. I acknowledge someone's gotten the better of me,"
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   and people don't like that.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So I think it's happening now,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and I don't think we know what's even happening to us.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   We also don't know what's happening in China.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I don't know how much truth is behind this,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   but I've heard that the Chinese algorithm on TikTok
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   shows a very different sort of world.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It's young Chinese people doing engineering and being smart
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and conscientious and admirable and patriotic.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Another consideration is 9.6 trillion minutes of Netflix watched in 2021,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   22.6 trillion minutes of TikTok watched in 2021.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Given the fact that a TikTok video at most can be 60 seconds
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   and probably the average Netflix thing is 30 minutes,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   that blows my mind.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It's staggering, and to your point,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   the Chinese version of TikTok, and it's Douyin,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   it's all aspirational.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Look at this kid from Shenzhen who's a concert pianist.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Look at the incredible research we're doing.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Look at these kids, what they're building in their high school.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's all uplifting.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   No politics. None at all.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So this is what the Chinese have decided they want their youth to see.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   - Could that not be an argument that in China,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   talking about the CCP in any way that's not positive
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   would be difficult to do, no matter how you put your finger
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   on the balance of the platform?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   They have a broader structure that stops people from doing that.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   - 100%, and some people would argue they shouldn't be our role model.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   But even if you take the societal issues
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and the complicated conversation around censorship in media,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   because whenever you hear the words "ban" and "media"
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   in the same sentence, you should understandably have a gag reflex,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   because I think one of the keys to a productive democratic society
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   is that pretty much anyone can say pretty much anything
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   about pretty much anyone else.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I do think that's super important.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But take that, push that aside.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Should Chinese sectors and companies have unfettered access
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   to our markets when we have absolutely none to theirs?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Twitter, Google, Meta, what's our access over there?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Zero.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   We have limited access.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   We have just enough access initially,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   and they create body language and a head fake
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   that they might let us be in there,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   just long enough so they can steal the intellectual property.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   They then prop up a local entrepreneur,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   fund that local entrepreneur, and their attitude is,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   "We can steal the Google algorithm,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   "or create a reasonable facsimile."
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And there's probably a $200-300 billion company,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   a search engine, that can just feed off the domestic market.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   What do you know? It's Baidu.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Why on earth are we going to go the Western way
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   and do what Italy or South Korea does
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and let our newspapers go out of business
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   and let all of the shareholder value transfer to California?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I mean, you've got to admire them.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   From a Chinese standpoint, it's smart.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   - It's really, really...
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Meanwhile, they're limiting the amount of time
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   that their children can play video games.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   One hour between 8 and 9 p.m. Friday, Saturday, Sunday per week.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   That's it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   The only way that you can play games is through a streaming service.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   The streaming service just-- Just flick the switch.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It's just not on. You can't do it.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   What's happening, people?
