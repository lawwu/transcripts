[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.880]   Visit Oasis at Death Valley dot com.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.580]   The Dow Jones industrial average has been flirting
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.580]   with 20,000 points
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.620]   for the last week or more,
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.800]   and it's got everybody quite tantalized.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.720]   At the moment, just very much looking forward to that
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.920]   magic 20,000 point mark.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.100]   As I record the show right now on January 11, 2017,
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.380]   it's at 19,954 points.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.300]   I think it's doing this little 90/10 rule for coming in for a kiss.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.960]   We've come in 90 percent and it's just simply sitting there and waiting,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.600]   waiting, waiting to make up the other 10 percent.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.960]   But here's the questions that matter, though.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.560]   Number one, what does it mean for the Dow to be at 20,000?
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   Number two, what does the Dow at 20,000 mean to you?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.560]   And what should you do
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.340]   about a 20,000 point Dow Jones industrial average?
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.340]   But first, sponsor of the day today, number one is Paladin Registry.
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.380]   Hey, if you're listening to this and you don't already know
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.440]   what Dow Jones industrial average is and what it means for it to be at 20,000
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.380]   points, that might mean that you don't have a good financial advisor
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.840]   to talk to and call.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.760]   And that might mean that you didn't already meet with a good financial advisor
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.540]   and ask them about that.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960]   Well, listen to the show.

[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   doesn't tell you how much money you have or what the performance of your portfolio is.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.460]   But Personal Capital can do that for you.

[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.760]   with the education and the insight
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.040]   that you need in order to live a rich and peaceful life now

[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.620]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.800]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.500]   Going to work very hard on that education and that insight today
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.760]   on this thorny question of Dow 20,000.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:21.220]   A lot of people out there making a lot of noise about Dow at 20,000.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.720]   What's always funny about records in the stock market indexes
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.980]   and things like that is there's such a
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.820]   just a kind of a clashing of of ideas and opinions on what it means.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.320]   I think of it like a place if you go out on a boat and when the tide is turning
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.060]   and you get two tidal currents where they meet, it's like these giant waves
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.560]   stand up where you get two currents that meet.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.940]   It's just these big standing waves that sit there.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.740]   And I think of Dow or Dow or any stock index records as that.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.940]   You have on the one hand, you have the bulls and the other hand,
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.700]   you have the bears and you have the bulls.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.160]   The bulls are excited about the fact that, hey, we're in new territory.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.400]   We're in uncharted territory.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.620]   The Dow at 20,000 points.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.240]   Whoo, things are going up.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.120]   Then you've got the bears.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   You're saying, oh, everything's going to be terrible.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.080]   And in today's world of financial media, where there's such a diversity of opinion.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.860]   I mean, the doom and gloomers are moaning and crying in their boots
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.320]   about Dow at 20,000, just saying it's the most obvious example
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.820]   of an overvalued market of all time.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.440]   Obviously, the Dow is at 20,000 and the economy is terrible.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.620]   So therefore, everything's a nightmare.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.120]   And on the flip side, of course, you can make the opposite case.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.580]   So what does it actually mean?
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.540]   Well, hard to boil all of the meaning down into one
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.120]   short, little succinct podcast, but I'm going to do my best.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.080]   I want to start with just a little bit of background information,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   a little bit of insight.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.720]   We're not going to try to do deep level financial analyst stuff.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.100]   Just a little bit of information on what is the Dow Jones Industrial Average?
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.980]   Where does it come from?
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.140]   What does it actually mean?
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.560]   How does it work?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.980]   What does 20,000 points mean?
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.720]   It's one of the most commonly known
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.480]   stock market indexes.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.600]   My guess would be that if you were going to ask
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.400]   normal people to name a stock market index,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.820]   most normal people would begin with listing off
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.000]   the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.900]   It's one of those things that's easily repeated.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.780]   It's reported at newscasts all the time, every evening news for decades.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.540]   Most people would probably have recognized Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.620]   far more than the S&P 500.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.260]   And it's one of the oldest indexes that's ever been created.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.720]   It was actually first calculated back in 1896.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.920]   Been around for quite a while.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.520]   Quick bit of history, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was named,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.400]   it was first created by a man named Charles Dow,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   who was the co-founder of the Dow Jones & Company.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.700]   He came up and started coming up with this idea of these indexes,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.240]   and he created it together with one of his business associates,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.820]   a statistician named Edward Jones.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.120]   And the point of it was to calculate
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.240]   how this basket of stocks would perform
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.000]   so that they could have a metric to judge the performance.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.200]   The Dow Jones Industrial Average is not the oldest index,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.580]   it's actually the second oldest index.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.620]   The first index that the Dow Jones & Company came up with
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.540]   was the Dow Jones Transportation Average.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.800]   That was the first index that they created.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.880]   And then they came up with this Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.560]   Now, it was largely originally intended to be related
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.400]   and connected to heavy industry.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.480]   Today, that's just kind of a historical misnomer
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.400]   because it does very little to do with heavy industry of any kind.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.900]   The index was originally created with 12 stocks in it,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.120]   and today it has about 30.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.960]   Here are the companies that are currently in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.500]   3M, American Express,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.260]   Apple Computer,
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.600]   Boeing,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.100]   Caterpillar,
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.640]   Chevron,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.560]   Cisco Systems,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.060]   Coca-Cola,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.520]   DuPont,
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.360]   ExxonMobil,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.140]   General Electric,
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.020]   Goldman Sachs,
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.740]   The Home Depot,
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.160]   IBM,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.660]   Intel,
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.540]   Johnson & Johnson,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.580]   JPMorgan Chase,
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.420]   McDonald's,
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.700]   Merck,
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.540]   Microsoft,
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.000]   Nike,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.580]   Pfizer,
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.760]   Procter & Gamble,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.340]   Travelers,
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.140]   United Health Group,
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.140]   United Technologies,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.600]   Verizon,
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.060]   Visa,
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.560]   Walmart,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.440]   and finally, Walt Disney.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.220]   Now, of course, you could see from those,
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.060]   Walt Disney is not a heavy industry company,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.100]   neither is Walmart, Visa, Verizon,
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.980]   or practically most of these.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.780]   So it's not an industrial average anymore.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.240]   But the components of the Dow have been changed many times.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.820]   A total of 51 times.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.240]   But it's, you know,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.000]   they've tried to keep the index reflective.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.780]   The company that's been in there the longest
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.540]   was General Electric.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.780]   They started being listed in the index in 1907,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.000]   and here in 2017, 110 years later,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.760]   they still continue to be in there.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.040]   But at different times,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.960]   they've taken different companies in and out of the index.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.600]   So there are many attributes
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.020]   to the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.560]   that cause financial people
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.060]   and financially knowledgeable people
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.220]   to discount its importance.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.480]   But it's not to say it's unimportant.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.740]   It just has some significant features
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.900]   that make it very troubling,
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.000]   or not the most useful.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.820]   There are other indexes that are much more useful.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.700]   Probably the biggest thing that you should be aware of
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.880]   in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   is that it is what's called a price-weighted index.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.260]   This means that the most important factor
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.760]   in calculating the impact
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.640]   of the various up and down movements of the stocks
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.220]   of the companies that are used
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.600]   in calculating the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.440]   is their price.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.720]   Meaning price is measured in dollars per share.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.900]   So if you have a stock that is $20 per share,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   and that moves up by one point from $20 to $21 per share,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.980]   then that will move the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.140]   up by one point.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.180]   If you have a stock that's $80 per share
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.940]   and it moves up from $1, from $80 to $81,
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.700]   that'll move the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.360]   up by one point.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.100]   Now, if it were all as simple as that,
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.300]   it's not, I'll get to that in just a moment,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.880]   but if it were all as simple as that,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.300]   you could immediately start to see
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.200]   some of the potential problems of this structure.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.340]   So pretend it's as simple as a dollar,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.200]   for every dollar that the share price changes,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.740]   that changes the average by one point.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.360]   You can see here that you don't get any insight
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.340]   into how large any particular company is
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.380]   or how many shares of stock that a company has.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.120]   See, you could have a company that has 10 shares of stock
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.900]   at $10 a piece, or you could have that same exact company
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.100]   could issue 20 shares of stock at $5 a piece,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.660]   and the company would get exactly
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.900]   the same amount of revenue.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.260]   You as an investor could buy the same value of the shares,
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.940]   you just have a slightly different number.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.700]   And there are different reasons why some companies
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.740]   will have stock prices that'll trade at lower dollars
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.820]   and some companies will have stock prices
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.380]   that'll trade at higher dollars.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.660]   You famously have the share prices of something like a stock
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.180]   like Berkshire Hathaway, which is tens of thousands
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.980]   and now over $100,000, or you might have companies
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.940]   that are down on their, considered to be penny stocks
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.760]   that are super cheap.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.140]   So the share price can change dramatically,
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.140]   and it's not so much the actual share price
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.680]   that is important as the value of the company.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.900]   But the value of the company,
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.500]   that's called the market capitalization, market cap,
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.420]   is not reflected in the price of the stock,
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.440]   nor is it reflected in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.340]   So you can also see here that if you have a company
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.340]   that is very strong, but is moving from $80 in value
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.740]   to $81 in value, that's a much smaller percentage move
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.740]   than a company that's $20 in value
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.660]   and moving from $20 to $21 in value.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.920]   So this price weighting methodology
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.140]   has some substantial problems with it.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.340]   Now, before I go on, the Dow is not today,
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.340]   as simple, it's not the 30 companies
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.960]   and the price of their shares calculated out
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.580]   and multiplied out to equal
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.680]   the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.880]   What's happened over the years
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.040]   is that there are all kinds of changes
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.640]   that have had to be made to the index
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.960]   in order to keep it functioning.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.320]   When it was originally built with those 12 stocks,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.940]   it was that simple.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.960]   You just take the total price divided of all the stocks,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.200]   divided by 12, and that would be
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.760]   the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.780]   But today, because of all of the stock splits
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.320]   and the spinoffs, and sometimes new stocks come in
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.560]   and new stocks go out,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.200]   they have to consistently update the divisor,
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.160]   the number that is actually pulled in.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.680]   And the divisor is changed constantly.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.240]   It's varied all over the place in terms of the price.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   It was, the divisor in 1928 was at 16.67 points,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.960]   so you would take all the prices of the stocks
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.480]   of the 30 companies and multiply it up,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.320]   divided by 16.67, and it's very, very low now.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.260]   I don't have the current one in front of me,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:59.260]   but it's like 0.13 something, blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.520]   It's published in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.600]   So this number is what's calculated in
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.860]   to wind up being the 20,000 point number
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.480]   of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.040]   But that price weighting thing is a real problem.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.560]   It means that companies don't necessarily have
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   the influence that the size of the company would indicate.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.240]   Here's just one example from a Bloomberg article
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.600]   from today that makes the point here.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.240]   The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed about 13%,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.120]   or 2,250 points, since the end of 2015.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   Its four best performers, all rising a similar amount,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.240]   added about 1,000 points between them.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.960]   But look at the distribution of those points.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.720]   A 30% gain in $309 billion JP Morgan,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.780]   again, $309 billion JP Morgan,
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.800]   was only good enough for 136 points.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.640]   I'm gonna read that again just in case
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.440]   you're driving down the road, pay attention to the numbers.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.360]   A 30% gain in $309 billion JP Morgan
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.160]   was only good enough for 136 points,
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.480]   while $101 billion rival Goldman Sachs
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:27.960]   contributed 415 points with a 33% increase.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.840]   So Goldman Sachs, a company that's a third of the size,
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.440]   contributes 415 points with a similar increase in value
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.520]   as compared to JP Morgan.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.680]   The best performer in the index, Caterpillar,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.680]   rose 37% and contributed 172 points.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.740]   Despite having a market capitalization of $55 billion.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.000]   Size doesn't matter in the Dow.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.200]   That's a real problem.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   So it's a good example here just to show
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.960]   how big of a deal this is, which is why generally,
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.800]   financial advisors don't pay much attention to the Dow
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.060]   in their portfolios or anything,
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.120]   it's more of a historical thing,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.120]   and the public likes it than just about anything else.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.840]   Here's another paragraph from that article.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.400]   They said, "Want to get the Dow above $20,000?
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.520]   Example, time for an experiment.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   Let's take $153 billion Cisco,
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.040]   which has the lowest stock price in the Dow,
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.960]   and see what happens when it's replaced.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.880]   Here's what the Dow would look like
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   when a selection of worthy constituents,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.400]   $18 billion Campbell Soup."
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.520]   So there's a chart,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.840]   so I obviously had to read it to you.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.100]   "$18 billion Campbell Soup,
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.960]   $37 billion Emerson Electric,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   or even $10 billion Harley-Davidson are added.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.400]   It takes all of those over at 20,000.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.560]   So any one of those companies,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   you can swap out $153 billion Cisco,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.600]   swap in $18 billion Campbell Soup,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.760]   $37 billion Emerson Electric,
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.820]   or $10 billion Harley-Davidson,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.360]   and boom, you're over 20,000.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.680]   Just don't replace it with $76 billion price line,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.040]   'cause that'll take all the fun out of Dow 30,000.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   You're immediately at Dow over 30,000
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.680]   if you just swap in price line."
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.360]   So hopefully you get the idea.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.440]   The point is that for actual analysis,
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.480]   it's not particularly useful.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.760]   Now, does it matter?
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.440]   Yes, it does matter.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.840]   Probably the best thing about the Dow
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.440]   is just simply how old it is.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.320]   Because the Dow is so old,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.920]   you can go and you can take this consistent methodology
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.760]   and you can clearly chart the growth of the American economy,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.400]   the growth of the companies
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.880]   that have been involved in the Dow.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   It gives you a good indication of the direction
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.200]   of the value of the share prices of the companies.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   It's also important simply because it's always out there.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.760]   It's always out there in the news.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   And it indicates the direction of the markets.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.720]   So certainly the Standard & Poor's 500 and NASDAQ
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.500]   are much better indexes to watch.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.280]   But you'll see that these generally move together.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.120]   And so the S&P 500 and NASDAQ
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.440]   are also at or near their own all-time highs.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   So the Dow is definitely an index that sends a signal.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.520]   It's definitely something that people will notice.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.760]   When it goes over 20,000, it will be news.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.560]   It'll be front page news.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.920]   You'll see it in the news.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.000]   You'll see it on the websites.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.080]   You'll see it on social media, et cetera.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.680]   You'll see people crowing about it.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.860]   You'll see it as attributed to all kinds of people.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.700]   President Obama's final victory of his administration.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.580]   You'll see people moaning about it.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.920]   It's the signal of the end of the world as we know it.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.920]   But you'll certainly see the 20,000 mark talked about.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.300]   It is going to matter.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.420]   So that's what the Dow is.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.360]   And the answer to it is yes, it does matter.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.080]   Now let's get more personal.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.920]   Let's talk about what should the Dow at 20,000 mean to you
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.480]   and then what should you do about it
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.460]   in your own personal investments
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.380]   and your own personal financial life.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.200]   First, what should it mean to you?
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.960]   Well, it should mean in some ways very little to you
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.320]   because you should be watching your money,
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.660]   not other people's money.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.200]   So yes, Dow Jones Industrial Average at 20,000
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.280]   is a social signal.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.760]   It's gonna play into the tenor around you
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.120]   and that does matter.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.520]   But the more important factor would be
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.120]   what's your personal index?
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   What's your personal performance?
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.460]   How is your portfolio doing?
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.800]   Those are the numbers that matter
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.280]   because you can't spend the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.120]   but you can spend the money in your accounts.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.360]   And so this should be a signal to you
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.620]   to stop and to look at your accounts
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.380]   and to see, well, how am I doing?
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.400]   Am I at record highs?
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.720]   Is my portfolio at record highs?
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.640]   How's the performance of my portfolio?
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.680]   Perhaps pull up a chart
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.000]   of the Dow Jones Industrial Average performance
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.520]   and compare that to your performance
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.560]   and see how things rank up.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.080]   That's what it should mean to you.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.180]   It should be a signal.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.080]   Because beyond the fact
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.600]   that the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.900]   simply has psychological effects on the population
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.020]   of the United States and the world and on stock traders,
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.160]   it doesn't mean anything to you.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.140]   It doesn't affect your life.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.820]   But your portfolio affects your life.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.560]   Your portfolio is what you can actually spend.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.020]   Your portfolio is what will determine how wealthy
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.160]   or poor you wind up being in the future.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.260]   You need to pay careful attention
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.480]   to the emotions that you feel.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.080]   Many people will feel an emotion about,
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.900]   "Hey, I'm at Dow 20,000.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.160]   "This is the top, this is the end.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.820]   "It's all gonna go down from now."
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   You need to handle that emotion.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:21.700]   Many people will feel the emotion of the opposite.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.400]   "Dow was great.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.300]   "Hey, the times are good.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.280]   "Let me go ahead and put more money in."
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.680]   Both of these emotional reactions need to be tempered
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   by careful analytical thinking
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   and careful reevaluation of your goals.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   More on this in a moment,
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.400]   but the reason I chose these two sponsors for today's show
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.520]   is because they fit in so perfectly.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.120]   Again, Personal Capital, Paladin Registry.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.440]   Personal Capital, what you should do about Dow 20,000
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.040]   is go right over to your Personal Capital dashboard,

[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.140]   And then boom, Personal Capital will give you
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.920]   this beautiful dashboard of all of your accounts.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   If you have banking accounts,

[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.320]   If you have investment accounts that you've linked up,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.720]   you'll see all of that investment data.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.040]   And you can start to look through some of the analytics
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.000]   and some of the metrics and start to track
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.080]   the performance of your actual portfolio.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.880]   They've done a wonderful job opening up these metrics.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.440]   That's to me one of the biggest values of Personal Capital.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.760]   Yeah, they've got the budget tracking stuff,
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.980]   but I think their proactive budgeting stinks.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.560]   It's the same as anybody else.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.640]   But their dashboard is beautiful
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.940]   and they've got great insights on investments.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.840]   So that would be the first place that I would go
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.480]   is go over to my Personal Capital account,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.800]   pull things open and take a look.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.280]   And let's just review.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.400]   Are my account balances at record numbers?
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.020]   How's my net worth statement?
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.080]   We just finished up January 1, 2017.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.680]   How much did your net worth grow in the last calendar year?
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.720]   All of these questions are questions that you can answer
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.200]   simply by using the Personal Capital,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.680]   Personal Finance tools.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.280]   That again, sign up for free, use my link.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.040]   Please use my tracking link so I get credit for your visit.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.920]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/personalcapital
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.260]   and sign up for a free account there.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.640]   Link all your accounts and then start tracking your net worth,
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.340]   start using it to track your investment performance.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.720]   Then also Paladin Registry.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.120]   Paladin Registry again is a registry service
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.040]   for vetted financial advisors.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.780]   So if you're looking for a financial advisor,
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.400]   you can go down the street to the financial district
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.960]   and walk into some offices.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.280]   You can go through the phone book
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.920]   or go online and start looking.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.400]   The challenge is that there's no way to know
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.180]   if that advisor has been screened
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.920]   on any circumstances whatsoever.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.600]   So what you've gotta do is you've gotta start
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.920]   by going through and screening financial advisors.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.600]   Well, if you start with Paladin Registry,
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.960]   you can cut that process short
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.680]   because Paladin Registry, the founder Jack Wehmeyer,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.760]   built this screen of 15 different points
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.640]   and they will go in and start to focus
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.320]   and they've pre-selected the financial advisors.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.420]   So you may or may not be able to find somebody
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.840]   that works with your personality,
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.080]   that you feel really gets you and gets your goals.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.260]   But at least you can be confident
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:21.260]   that you're talking to people who are honest,
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.320]   who have ethical backgrounds,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.260]   and who are knowledgeable in the personal finance
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.680]   and investing space.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.800]   So find a great financial advisor
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.720]   'cause you should have, hey,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.240]   if you got questions about Dow 20,000,
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.560]   you probably should have started there.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.680]   Find a great financial advisor
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.520]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin,
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.320]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.520]   Now, back to emotions.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.440]   Anytime the markets hit highs and lows,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.480]   you should carefully look at and think about
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.980]   and consider and analyze your personal emotions.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.640]   If you find yourself right now
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.040]   extremely nervous about your investments,
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.560]   you need to sit down and talk
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.520]   with your financial advisor about your nervousness.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.660]   Are you nervous that the market's gonna fall apart?
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:13.000]   If so, pay attention to that.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.680]   Because if you don't understand your nervousness
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.200]   and you don't pay attention to it,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   it'll be very easy for you to succumb
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.320]   to an emotional decision in the future.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.580]   Now, stock market investing may or may not be right for you
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.200]   and your portfolio may or may not be right for you.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   Not every, in my opinion, not everybody should own stocks.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.500]   I don't buy the line that everybody should own stocks,
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.140]   everybody should own mutual funds.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:37.980]   Guess what?
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.340]   There are lots of rich people in your town
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.180]   who got rich and never owned stocks.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.580]   And what many of them have learned
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.740]   is they simply didn't have the temperament
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.140]   to handle the ups and downs of the stock market.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.100]   And so they wisely pointed their finger
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.500]   at the people who were in the stock market.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.400]   They pointed their focus in a different direction.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.620]   Now, obviously, I'm here to seek to educate you
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.620]   on what numbers mean, what stocks mean, et cetera.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.960]   Your financial advisor is there to educate you
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.840]   on what these things mean.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.220]   But the point of it all is simply that
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.000]   you need to understand for yourself
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.800]   what's true and what's not and what works for you.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.040]   Now, a couple of comments on kind of what's going on
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   with Dow 20,000.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.260]   There are definitely some political winds
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.640]   that are blowing, in my opinion,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.400]   definitely some political winds that are blowing the Dow.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.080]   And we should pay attention to that.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   I think that with the election of Donald,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.340]   President-elect Donald Trump,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.960]   that changed the financial markets.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   And he certainly has been making many more overtures
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.320]   toward the world of finance,
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.680]   focusing heavily on pro-growth policies.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.760]   He's promised to be the greatest jobs president that,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   he said, "I'm gonna be the greatest jobs president
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.440]   "that God ever created."
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.000]   I think that's his quote. (laughs)
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.400]   I didn't know that God created jobs presidents.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   But who knows?
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.160]   Who knows, maybe he will be.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.080]   But he's very, very focused on seeking to build up
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.920]   and grow jobs and to stimulate the economy.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.360]   Of course, you have to ask the question,
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.120]   and the libertarian free market guy in me
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.440]   wants to always ask, okay,
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.720]   what impact does the president actually have?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.480]   But at the very least, the president makes a signal.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.600]   And Wall Street has been thoroughly happy
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.040]   with the election of President-elect Trump
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.280]   in terms of the signals that he's sending.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.320]   There's also probably just the fact
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.280]   that you have a Republican majority in the House,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.960]   you have a Republican majority in the Senate,
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.880]   and you have Republican presidents.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.400]   That is a remarkable, well, it's a remarkable move.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.200]   So what it means is that the Republicans,
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.320]   if they are able to work effectively together,
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.280]   will probably be able to pass more bills
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.960]   than past Congresses, where the Congress and the president,
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.240]   the legislative branch and the executive branch
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.960]   are at loggerheads with one another.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.680]   So time will tell.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.160]   Certainly had an impact.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.920]   Now, the question, of course, is do politics
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.640]   determine the direction of your portfolio?
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.200]   And this is the biggest thing that often frustrates me
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.920]   that when I read articles and analysis that people make
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.040]   is people often assume that the country
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.000]   is synonymous with the companies in the country.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.600]   So for example, the United States
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.840]   has extremely difficult financial problems
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.200]   in terms of large debts,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.640]   and especially large debts
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.600]   that are not generally reported on the books,
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.000]   commonly called unfunded liabilities.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.760]   You have problems, major problems,
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.120]   with Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   accounts for 50% of the budget of the United States
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.160]   and just a massive financial boondoggle.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.600]   Totally underfunded, depending on the number that you use.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.760]   You were talking hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.360]   I use the number about $220 trillion.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.780]   I cite Professor Kotlikoff from Boston University,
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.520]   but whatever, they're different estimates and who knows.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.960]   This is not the current debt.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.520]   This is not the current debt as expressed
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.960]   as a percentage of GDP.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.520]   It's just a significant problem.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.280]   But the question is, is that problem solvable
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.120]   and does that problem have to be solved by the companies?
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.960]   I think this is one of the constant things that I see,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.480]   that companies and countries are different entities.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.080]   You can't look at those companies
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.680]   that are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.000]   and think that the only influence on them
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.960]   in terms of their profits
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.840]   is just how the American economy performs
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.800]   or what the American government does.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.360]   You have Apple Corporation and Boeing Corporation,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.800]   Coca-Cola.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.040]   Are these companies entirely reliant
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.960]   on what the US government does or doesn't do
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.860]   or the financial fiscal problems of the US government?
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.320]   No, they have massive global enterprises,
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   huge, massive global enterprises.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.880]   And so thus, you always have to dig down
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.580]   a little bit deeper and say, how does my company work?
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.640]   Where does the revenues come from for my company?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.840]   What are the factors that are gonna influence my profits
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.000]   at the end of the year?
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.840]   That's the type of analysis that will make a difference.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.700]   No question, the President of the United States
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.120]   will have an impact on the company.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.880]   And these poor companies that get called out
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   and President-elect Trump's tweets
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.200]   or in his speeches this afternoon,
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.600]   he recorded his press conference
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.800]   and he started talking about pharmaceutical companies
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   and all the pharma stocks went down
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.040]   or Boeing got hammered and their stock got hammered
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.400]   because he got called out on the new Air Force One project.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.340]   So certainly these companies are affected,
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.980]   but these are blips.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.980]   These are small blips on the radar screen
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.960]   in terms of the actual performance of the company.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.080]   So always remember,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.800]   companies and countries are not the same thing.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.400]   Second, always remember,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.220]   companies have the ability to change.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.320]   Some quickly, some slowly,
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.240]   but companies have the ability to change.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.800]   Companies, even including the large ones,
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.020]   though they face many problems with massive bureaucracy,
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.560]   they face many advantages due to their size
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.680]   and they can change.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.560]   And they're staffed by smart men and women
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.440]   who are looking at all the same information that you are
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.160]   and seeking to understand how do we gain more customers,
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.680]   how do we build more profits,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.960]   and how do we make sure
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.640]   that we return profits to our owners?
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   That's what they're doing.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.200]   And they can change.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.080]   They can change from the top to the bottom.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.120]   They can change all kinds of things.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.720]   Now, obviously, they're not all gonna change for the better.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.500]   Sometimes they're gonna make mistakes,
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.460]   but they can change.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.900]   And companies can change and adapt their business model
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.700]   to face a changing world.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.660]   So important to always keep that in mind.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.620]   No matter what the laws do,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:23.220]   no matter what legal changes come about,
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.060]   no matter what the Federal Reserve Board does,
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.740]   a company has the ability to change,
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.320]   change its operations.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.460]   Yeah, I had an interesting experience thinking about it.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.080]   There's a lot of fuss in the previous election cycle
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.260]   about the potential changes of minimum wage laws.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.460]   And long-time listeners of the show know
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.300]   I'm emphatically opposed to minimum wage laws.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.420]   I think they're discriminatory, and they hurt workers.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.980]   They do nothing but drive down employment,
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.260]   and they hurt the people who can afford to be the least hurt.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.220]   Minimum wage laws hurt the poor.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.880]   They hurt the uneducated.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.300]   They hurt many of the young.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.100]   And so they're a terrible idea, in my opinion.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.980]   That comes from a profoundly deep free market conviction,
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.020]   and the profound belief in the ability of two individuals
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.780]   to come together and strike whatever voluntary contract
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.860]   they wanna strike with one another.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.860]   But that's a politically unpopular opinion.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.420]   It's politically popular to say,
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.940]   well, we need to pay a working wage.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.780]   Well, who knows?
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.600]   Who knows if I'm right?
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.760]   Who knows if other people are right?
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.220]   But there was a lot of hullabaloo about a minimum wage
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.420]   and raising the minimum wage.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.240]   Well, I've predicted for a long time and have observed
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.980]   that if you lobby for a higher minimum wage,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.660]   all you're lobbying for is your employer to work harder
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.080]   on finding a cheaper replacement for you.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.260]   So you'd better be careful.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.440]   And one of the biggest changes that I have seen
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.460]   is many of the minimum wage type jobs,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.060]   especially service-related jobs, are in jeopardy.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.780]   This has happened slowly.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.700]   But cashier services, for example.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.720]   In the beginning, when self-checkout lanes first came open,
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.240]   they were a little bit frustrating to use.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.800]   They didn't work all that well.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.160]   And so many people chose to go and work with the cashier.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.440]   So stores came out with just one or two lanes.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.260]   But I have observed that more and more,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.720]   self-checkout lanes are much more popular.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.400]   I personally often use the self-checkout lane
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.200]   'cause it moves quickly.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.600]   I can move quickly as long as people in front of me
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.360]   are working, the payment systems are working faster.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.080]   Just the whole process has been streamlined.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.720]   There is a lot of fuss in the fast food working industry
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.120]   about the minimum wage.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.040]   And I predicted for several years
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.240]   that the fast food industry would replace
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.280]   the frontline workers with a computerized system.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.760]   And there may be different applications of this.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.560]   You can see this happening with ordering
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.200]   on an app on your phone.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.920]   The technology is completely perfectly there
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   where a company can use a geolocation on your phone
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.480]   with your restaurant's application.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.520]   You can pay, you can do it all right
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.140]   through the payment systems on the phone.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.320]   You can just pick up, walk in, put the order on your phone
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.560]   and you walk in and pick up the bag.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.080]   Or you can use the kiosk.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.680]   Well, for the first time this last two weeks ago
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.520]   when I was on vacation, I was up in Georgia,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.480]   and I saw for the first time a McDonald's
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.920]   that had kiosks, ordering kiosks,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.560]   where instead of going up to the counter
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.920]   and giving your order to the person behind the counter,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.120]   you could just simply punch the info in the computer.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.520]   Same thing is coming.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.920]   So that's gonna come and it's gonna spread
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.400]   and be the majority of the ordering systems in the future,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.220]   in my opinion.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.120]   Who knows?
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.360]   Again, I could be wrong, but that's my prediction.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.920]   Because I would probably rather deal with a kiosk
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.360]   than deal with a person,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.800]   especially a person who doesn't bring any value
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.700]   and who winds up being more frustrated,
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.600]   frustrating to interact with
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.880]   because of poor customer service,
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.920]   at least with a computer I know what I'm gonna get.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   So that represents, my point is that
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.240]   that represents an indication, a current trend
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   that you can watch and see in your own experience
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.000]   of how companies will adapt and will change
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.920]   based upon legislation and based upon economic environment.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   If wages were, if a company could pay $2 an hour
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.240]   to a worker to take orders,
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   they would have almost no incentive to bring on computers,
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.880]   my guess, I haven't researched all of their books.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.560]   But there is a point, however,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.720]   at which the labor costs become so high
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.600]   and then the person is replaced by a computer.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.080]   So companies have the ability to make that change.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.520]   That's very different than governments.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.840]   Friend of mine, longtime political reporter
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.320]   and has talked about a lot about Washington
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.200]   and just tells me some of the stories
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.160]   and the rules and things that are in place
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.200]   on federal workers and the federal government.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.180]   It's almost impossible to get rid of people.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.480]   Well, companies will work their way through that.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.840]   So don't associate governments and companies too tightly.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.480]   Yes, they influence each other.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.580]   Yes, they both matter, but they are not synonymous.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.000]   They're simply not.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.440]   Now, what should you do about Dow 20,000?
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.760]   Anytime you listen to information,
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   anytime you listen to things, you should always ask,
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.800]   what's my action?
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.960]   What's the next action?
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.800]   Do I need to do something with this?
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.900]   So that should be what you're thinking.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.780]   What do you need to do about Dow 20,000?
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.380]   If you take in an information like,
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.020]   hey, the Dow's at 20,000 and it doesn't affect you,
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.860]   then don't worry about it.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.660]   If it's outside of your,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.080]   something that you can affect or change
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.700]   or should change and affect, don't worry about it.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.660]   Just move on with your day.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.680]   Focus on something that is important to you.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.580]   What should you do?
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.780]   Well, sit, look at your investments, see how they're doing.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.180]   If your financial plan dictates
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.880]   that you should be making changes,
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.920]   you might take advantage of market highs
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.500]   as an opportunity to sell.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.940]   But that should be driven by your financial plan,
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.240]   not just based upon,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.100]   hey, I'm nervous about something.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.920]   We'll get to the investment plan in a moment.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.900]   Your financial plan is how your money
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.040]   actually integrates in your life.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.340]   Your financial plan is what drives
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.180]   your personal decisions.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.980]   Were you investing for retirement?
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.660]   Is that retirement 30 years from now?
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.500]   Well, if that retirement is 30 years from now,
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.060]   then Dow at 20,000 is not gonna be influential
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.860]   in your personal decisions.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.140]   Now, are you planning to retire two years from now?
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.060]   Well, Dow at 20,000 might be an indicator
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.340]   that it's time to go ahead and start taking some cash out
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.900]   to start funding the first few years of retirement.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.820]   If you were planning to buy a house,
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.020]   Dow at 20,000 might be an indicator of a high market,
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.860]   so it's a good time to go ahead and sell.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.840]   Or you were thinking about starting a business.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.620]   Well, if you're thinking about starting a business,
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.580]   you might say, I need to move my money to cash,
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.940]   so Dow at 20,000 would be a good time to do that.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.380]   That's what I've done in the past.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.060]   If you decide that you're gonna sell,
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.420]   like for me, I was starting a business,
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.500]   decided I didn't wanna own stocks anymore,
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.400]   wait for a high time to do it.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.040]   This might be the time to do that.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.700]   But that needs to be driven by your financial plan.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.240]   The plan that involves your financial decisions
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.760]   and your personal goals.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.940]   Now, what about your investment plan?
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.560]   Should you change your investment plan
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.160]   because of the Dow at 20,000?
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.180]   Well, if your written investment plan
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.180]   has in it a sell indicator of if the Dow hits 20,000,
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:43.200]   then sell, then yes, you should change something.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.260]   But I guarantee that not a single one
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.920]   of your investment plans has that as an indication.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.280]   So, short answer is no, you should not change anything.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.480]   You don't change midstream in your investment plan
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.680]   unless something has materially changed.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.660]   In your life, your financial plan has changed,
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.160]   your life goals have changed,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.940]   or you've decided to change your strategy,
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.040]   but you don't change just because
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.080]   you have a certain indication.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.640]   You follow the pre-planned,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.460]   pre-thought-out investment plan.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.720]   A majority of you don't have a written investment plan,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.760]   so what do you do?
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.160]   Well, you keep doing what you're doing
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.360]   until you decide to change to a different strategy.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.720]   Yeah, there are a few of you who are traders in the market,
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.040]   but you're not listening to this
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.280]   with the perspective of changing.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.600]   Dow 20,000 is just,
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.480]   you're already taking that information in.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.520]   The majority of you who own stocks
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.960]   own them in the context of a mutual fund.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:37.160]   And those mutual funds are either actively managed
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.560]   or they're passive index funds.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.520]   If your mutual funds are actively managed,
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.080]   then by definition, you have chosen
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.440]   to hire a fund manager to manage your money for you,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.740]   and you're paying that fund manager
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.340]   to choose the companies that they need to invest in.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.400]   So trust the fund manager to do their job.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.180]   That's the investment plan that you've chosen.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.560]   If you own a mutual fund that's investing,
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.000]   one of my favorite mutual funds, I always loved it,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.280]   Investment Company of America with American Funds.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   They had the best brochure.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.720]   I just, I love that American success story
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.520]   of the classic mutual fund with, what, 80 years of history.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.440]   I always loved that fund.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.000]   And they had the best brochure that was just so fun to read.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.520]   Always was a favorite of mine.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.700]   I'm not saying it's good, bad.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.280]   I'm not giving a buy recommendation.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.560]   I just thought it was a neat mutual fund.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.440]   So if you have your money
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.340]   in the Investment Company of America with American Funds,
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.000]   you've hired the fund managers
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.160]   to make these investment decisions for you.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.080]   They're gonna invest in the best companies of America,
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.000]   and they're gonna try to do so in an intelligent way.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   So Dow at 20,000 is information that they're taking in.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.840]   They're taking in that information.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.480]   They're seeking to make intelligent financial decisions,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.520]   investment decisions because of it.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.760]   They might be looking down and saying,
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.160]   "Hey, Home Depot is doing well.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.560]   "Walmart's doing well.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.960]   "We think we have these other companies
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.840]   "that are gonna be doing better.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.700]   "Let's take some profit from Home Depot and Walmart
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.200]   "and buy these other companies."
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.620]   But the point is, that's not you.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.820]   That's your fund manager.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.000]   That's what you signed up for.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.860]   Now, if something in your personal life has changed,
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.680]   then you would sell at Dow 20,000.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.800]   But if nothing in your personal life has changed
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.400]   such that you're not gonna need the money,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.320]   don't change because of market indicators.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.760]   And I'll give you the same speech
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.160]   at the bottom of the market.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.120]   Just happens to be that this is the top version.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.100]   Now, if you're an indexer, okay,
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.640]   well, you have index funds.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.320]   You don't have an investment manager
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.640]   who is choosing companies.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.160]   But what are you committed to?
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.880]   You are committed in an indexing strategy
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.680]   to the overall growth of these companies,
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.120]   and you're committed to the fact
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.280]   that you can't guess which ones are gonna do better
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.320]   than others, so you're just gonna own all of them.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.180]   So is there anything about the news of Dow at 20,000
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.720]   that will cause you to change?
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.880]   There's nothing.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   Unless something has changed in your personal life,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.200]   in your personal plans,
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.820]   you wouldn't change your investment strategy
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.060]   just because of Dow 20,000.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.940]   Because to do so would mean
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.940]   that you are sacrificing your strategy.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.260]   You're not following it.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:31.740]   Now, it's okay to change your strategy.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.380]   Let's say you're changing your investment strategy.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.500]   You can do that.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.780]   But that would be because something has changed
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.720]   outside of Dow 20,000,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.180]   and now you're just using an opportune time
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.300]   to go ahead and sell.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.900]   I hope, I know this is simplistic,
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.100]   and there are a few of you who are pursuing
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.320]   your own unique trading strategies and things like that.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.200]   Obviously, this isn't relevant to you.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.500]   But to the vast majority of you,
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.580]   I just summed up all of your investment strategies.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.700]   You've either hired a mutual fund manager
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.780]   to manage your money within mutual funds,
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   or you've chosen to hire a passive indexing company
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.860]   to hold your money in,
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.780]   and you don't change your strategy because of Dow 20,000.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.220]   Might be a good time to rebalance, I guess.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.140]   Article here that I may be covering in the future
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.100]   talks about, titled for this last week,
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.580]   portfolio rebalancing might be overrated.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.340]   We may talk about that on a news roundup, we'll see.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.220]   But might be a good time to rebalance.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.060]   Might be a good time to take some money.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.980]   It's always fun to take money out of a portfolio
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.220]   and spend it if you wanna take a big cruise or something.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.140]   But don't make quick decisions because of things out there
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.380]   that aren't really related to you,
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.340]   and aren't really related to your specific actions
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.300]   and to your goals.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:57.300]   Dow 20,000 is meaningful because of the buzz
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.860]   that it will put in the market.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.660]   And then also because it's reflective of other indexes.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.260]   But the index itself is not particularly useful
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.980]   for analysis, it's really not.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.300]   It's kind of just an old fashioned,
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.500]   fun thing to keep an eye on because it has such a history.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.900]   And it's not useful to your life.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:26.900]   So, don't worry about it.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.620]   Notice it, enjoy it.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.460]   It's good to enjoy when the market goes up,
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.900]   as long as you're not gonna get too depressed
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.380]   when it goes down, 'cause it'll go down.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.180]   Time will tell when, we don't know when,
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.020]   we don't know how much.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.260]   But just remember, one out of three years,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.980]   the market's gonna be down a third.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.780]   Every year it's gonna wander around,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.780]   I don't know, 15%, 14%, 15%.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.780]   It's gonna wander up, it's gonna wander down.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.340]   Probably in the next couple decades,
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.580]   it's gonna go down by 50%.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.220]   So you should be ready for that.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.900]   That's what you signed up for
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.420]   when you signed up to invest in stocks.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.540]   If you don't like it, get out.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.620]   Your financial advisor should have told you
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.460]   to get out.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.860]   Or educate yourself until you like it.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.300]   Anyway, that's it, thank you all so much.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.540]   Oh, oh, oh, as we go here, one quick thing.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.240]   I need a huge favor from you guys.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.580]   Web address, I wasn't prepared.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.860]   You can enjoy the music for about 10 seconds.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:35.880]   All right.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.280]   I'm just gonna make a link, okay.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.920]   I'm doing a survey.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.520]   With new advertising, I need to,
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.000]   if you'd be willing to help me,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I need to get a little bit of demographic information.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.800]   So I'm doing a very quick demographic survey.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.760]   I'm working on selling a lot more advertising
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.000]   on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.040]   I'm doing, again, a demographic survey.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.600]   If you could do me a favor, please.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.280]   If you just have about 15 seconds,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.640]   personal favor would mean helpful to me.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.720]   I need a statistically representative sample of you,
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.280]   of all of you to respond.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.000]   So that means I need at least several hundred
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.080]   of you to respond.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.600]   If you could please go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/survey.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.640]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/survey.

[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.600]   It's just a quick, simple,
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.240]   about a five question demographic survey.
