[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.040]   we're going to be chatting with a financial planner, what image comes to your mind?
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.440]   Do you think of maybe a middle-aged white guy with a suit and a tie, maybe a bow tie,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.960]   sitting in a mahogany-paneled conference room with a burgundy carpet and a bunch of plaques
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.520]   on the wall? Or do you think of a globetrotting young lady who has a double major in theater
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.400]   studies and women's studies? No, seriously, which one comes to mind? Yeah, of course, you saw the,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.080]   you know, the title of this episode, so of course you think of number two, but do most people? Well,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:05.440]   maybe they should.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.920]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and today is Thursday,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.200]   February 19, 2015. I am thrilled to bring you today's show, which is an interview with Sophia
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.720]   Barra, founder of Gen Y Planning. She's a financial planner specializing in working with Gen Y,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240]   and in just about every way that you can think of, she is most definitely not your father's planner.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:49.760]   And yes, that is her tagline, which I think is a very, a great one. She's not your father's
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320]   planner. I like that. This is an interview, I recorded this this last week when I was out at
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.520]   T3 in Dallas, Texas, one of the many interviews that I recorded out there, and it's really a good
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.280]   one. I think you're really going to enjoy it. I had a chance to sit down with Sophia the first
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.240]   night I was there and just really spend quite a bit of time hearing her story. And we met here
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.000]   and there, but I hadn't spent a ton of time together and it was a really fun interview.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.160]   I want to say thank you to a couple of the patrons of the show who were the ones who decided that
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.560]   this is the interview that you would hear today. I put this out on the Patreon page last night,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.120]   and I listed off the five interviews that I've got recorded, and any which of the five that I
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   could run today. And thanks to, let's see, Emilien, Sarah, and Quinn, all three of them voted for
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.440]   Sophia's interview. So thanks to the rest of you who voted. But thanks to the patrons of the show,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   you get to hear this interview with Sophia first. I think it may have had something to do with the
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.720]   fact that she's a lady. And the other four interviews, three of the other four, well,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   the other four interviews are with men. And one of them, four of the other ones are men, and three of
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.960]   them fit that stuffy old white guy persona pretty well. But Sophia doesn't. So naturally, we'll
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   bring you the good one right off the bat. Here's Sophia. Enjoy the interview. It's a great one.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   We talk a lot about financial planning, about her story. There's a bunch of tidbits and wisdom
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   strewn in. And let's get to it. So Sophia, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.600]   appreciate you being with me. Thank you so much for having me. This is super fun.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:39.680]   You are quite, somehow you've grown the skill of getting lots of people to mention your name.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.720]   Your name, I was, right before recording this interview, I was talking with Alan Moore,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.280]   and your name came up twice in two different things. It came up with Michael Kitsis. So
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.120]   you're doing a great job of getting your name and your message out there in front of people.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.480]   I congratulate you on that. Thank you so much. I feel super fortunate to have a great network of
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   other financial planners that are doing really interesting, creative things. And I've been
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.080]   really fortunate to get quite a bit of press the past year or two and just kind of build those
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.880]   connections and relationships. And it's just turned into more newsletter subscribers and more
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.360]   people coming to my website, signing up for prospect calls and turning into clients.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.560]   It's exciting. How did you wind up in the financial advisor business?
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.640]   That's a great question. I was a theater major in my undergrad. So, smooth transition into
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:42.880]   financial planning. So the backstory is that I actually wanted to buy a house when I graduated
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.480]   from college. I had read David Bach's Smart Women Finish Rich book. And so he had talked about one
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.520]   way to wealth was through real estate and buying a home. So I would sit in the personal finance
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   section of Barnes & Noble in between studying lines for Steel Magnolias and read every business
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.720]   and personal finance book I could get my hands on. And so I was just learning all these really
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.560]   interesting things like about Roth IRAs and budgeting. And I decided that if I was never
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.040]   going to make that much money as a theater major, I better know what to do with it. I was going to
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.880]   be an actor. So I graduated from college when I was 21 and I bought a house three months later.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.280]   And all my friends started coming to me with their money questions.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.880]   How do I get out of credit card debt? What do I do about my student loans? I just got a job,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.240]   but I have no idea how to read my benefits package. And so I really wanted to be able
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:50.080]   to answer their questions. And I found out about the CFP, just becoming a certified financial
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.000]   planner. And I realized, "Oh my gosh, there are people that actually help people with their money
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.880]   and get paid for it. This is so cool." So I started taking the CFP classes and met a guy in my class.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.320]   We studied for our CFP exam together and his firm was hiring and they ended up hiring me.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.520]   And that got my foot in the door. I was doing a lot of stuff in their back office and
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.120]   reconciling accounts and learning how to rebalance portfolios.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.720]   But what I realized was that the financial planning profession was really geared towards
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.800]   high net worth individuals and people who already had money, half a million dollar minimums or
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.840]   million dollar minimums at a lot of these firms. And the whole reason I got into it was because I
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.800]   wanted to help people my age be able to accumulate wealth and work through these big financial
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.880]   decisions that they had to make. So basically my career, I started out at this father-son
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.840]   planning firm. Then I transitioned to an independent fee-only firm where my mentor was
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.000]   working. And then after that, I ended up taking a job at a startup that was based in New York.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.240]   And I was working remotely from Minnesota. And I really loved working with people virtually.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.960]   And I thought, you know, I could work with people my age virtually. If I didn't have to pay for an
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.240]   office, if I didn't have much overhead, if I didn't have to hire a huge staff, then I think I
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:34.560]   could do this in a profitable way and basically be able to empower my generation with their finances
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:42.720]   and make it affordable and accessible. How long did you spend working with other firms before
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.760]   you started your own? So I got into the profession and I took my first CFP class in 2006. And then I
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.600]   got hired in 2007. And I took... While you were still taking classes? Yeah, so I was still taking
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:04.720]   classes until I took my exam in... My CFP exam in 2009. And then in 2010, I had enough financial
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.400]   planning experience to be able to use my CFP credentials, use my letters after my name.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.480]   And then... So I was at one firm for two and a half years, another firm for two years,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.360]   and then a startup for a year. And then I launched Gen Y Planning in May of 2013.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:31.360]   Well, I have to give you props. Your site was a real eye-opener for me when I originally found
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.680]   it. Because I don't remember when I found it. I should have brought that knowing that you were
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.560]   here to show you the papers. But I had come up with the idea of doing things on a monthly basis.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.920]   And I was at that time trying to figure out how to transition to podcasting. And I knew I needed a
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.520]   way to make money while I was building the base. And so I'd come up with the idea. And then through
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.960]   a bizarre series of circumstances, I came across Gen Y Financial, among other sources. And I sat
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:06.560]   here and I said, "Whoa, someone's doing this." And wow, if someone else is doing it, it's not just me.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.520]   And that means that... I don't know. I didn't know at the time if you're any good at it or
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.080]   actually paying your bills, but at least you're promoting the idea. So it was a real encouragement
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:23.840]   to me. Yeah, I'm sure trying to pay them. No. I'm just kidding. I launched Gen Y Planning.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:31.440]   And it was really funny because I had had this idea for a few years too. And other advisors I
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.520]   would talk to would tell me, "Why do you want to work with young people? Young people don't have
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.920]   any money." But what I realized is that it was an us problem, not a them problem. So it was an us
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.480]   problem with the way we were charging. We were only charging on assets under management. And what
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:55.920]   I figured out is that people were willing to pay for advice based on being able to be heard,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.280]   be able to get their questions answered. People were willing to pay a fee. So I charge an initial
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.920]   planning fee followed by a monthly subscription. And I meet with my clients twice a year and they
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   have unlimited email support with me. And that has seemed to be a really good fit. And then I
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.960]   also just launched an ebook last week actually called What You Should Have Learned About Money
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.200]   But Never Did, a Gen Y Guide to Empowered Personal Finance. And you can find it in the Kindle store.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:32.400]   It's on Amazon. It's $4.99. And now I feel like I finally have something at a low price point where
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.200]   people who are just graduating from college thinking about, "What are those basic skills I
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.680]   should be doing with my money in terms of building financial security?" Now I have a
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.400]   resource in which to direct them towards. So here I was creating all these blog posts,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.120]   but it was hard for people to find things on specific categories. And so now I have this
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.960]   ebook that's organized in a way that I think flows really well and is really able to give people
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.960]   a foundation and basis for how I work with my clients, how I think about personal finance,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.120]   and some things that they could do to get on track.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.680]   - In addition to that, didn't you start a group coaching course or something? Or like a virtual
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.760]   checkup? I saw you did something, but tell us what else you did.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.960]   - Yeah, so I haven't done any group coaching yet. It is something that I'm interested in doing.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:30.240]   Eventually I would really like to do a Money's a Millennial course. So basically I have two
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.200]   different financial planning services that I offer my clients. So what was happening was I was
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.120]   talking to all these great potential clients, but they were saying, "Sophia, I really want to work
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.880]   with you, but right now I'm really stressed out about my student loans. And I just need somebody
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.800]   to talk to to figure out what do I do about my student loans?" So I launched, in addition to my
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.520]   financial accountability program, which is the one where I work with people on an ongoing basis,
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.240]   I launched my Quick Start sessions. So that's...
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.200]   - That's what it was.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.560]   - Yeah. So for $499, it's a one-time fee, and it's an hour and a half long Skype call,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.760]   and it's one-on-one. And we dive deep in whatever two financial planning topics you want to talk
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.600]   about. I gather a little bit of information in advance, and then we have our call, and I shoot
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.520]   you an email with recommendations in those two topics after we call, or after our conversation.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.600]   And what's great about that is it's really a narrowed scope engagement. So it's a way for
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.200]   people to get a sense of how I work, what I do, and really address their credit card debt,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.160]   their student loans, how to start a Roth IRA. All those things are things I've talked about
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.880]   on Quick Start sessions, but it's a nice way for people to still get that one-on-one advice.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.840]   - So all those things sound really simple to me. It sounds to me like,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   why does somebody need help learning how to set up a Roth IRA? After all, if they're approaching you,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.920]   there's a gazillion articles written about Roth IRAs. If they need help, I mean, Dave Ramsey's
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:08.000]   got an empire built on paying off credit card debt. How is it that people wind up connecting
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.760]   with you personally on that type of question?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.320]   - So I think that there's a plethora of choice right now, right? So we're bombarded with
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.520]   financial information. And so a lot of times when people come to me, they've already done
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.840]   the research, they've read a bunch of articles, and now they're coming to me and they're saying,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:34.240]   "Sophia, I don't know if I should start a Roth IRA at Betterment. I don't know if I should start
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:40.560]   one at Vanguard. I don't know what types of investments I should choose. I'm scared."
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.880]   Like, "How do I move forward? I'm paralyzed by all of my options." So it's really nice for us to
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.840]   be able to chat. I can get an idea of their situation better. I can figure out which discount
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.560]   custodian might be a good fit for them and really help guide them in terms of, here's an appropriate
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:05.920]   asset allocation for your age, risk tolerance, time horizon, that type of thing. Because I've
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.080]   worked with, when I was at a startup in the past and we didn't talk about investments, for example,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.960]   I would make recommendations like, "Take your tax return and put it into a Roth IRA." So they would
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.400]   do that. And then we would talk a few months later and I would find out that the Roth IRA was sitting
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.280]   in the Fidelity Money Market Fund because they didn't understand that there was that second step.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   So once the money's in there, it's not just good enough to contribute to the Roth IRA, it's then
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.640]   making sure that money in the Roth is invested. So I think there's a disconnect there between the
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.480]   articles that are being written and the consumer. Yeah. And there's so many choices and it's so hard
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:54.240]   in today's world to really to work through them. You have, I guess, you mentioned as a good example,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:01.040]   Vanguard and Betterment, you have this massive focus, which is right, on saying, "I need to
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.080]   reduce my fees with my investment portfolio." Okay. I need to reduce my fees. So therefore,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.400]   I should always go with the lowest fee provider. But then you have all of these companies,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.720]   whether it's Betterment building on that basis, but charging, what do they charge? 20 basis points,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.800]   25 basis points, something like that. Something around there.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:26.080]   Or whether you go up to a firm or a mutual fund company like DFA, Dimensional Fund Advisors,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:34.240]   where here we're taking all of the science of indexing and passive investing, but we're adding
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.400]   this whole twist on it. We're adding on a whole bunch of fees, but we still think we're competitive
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.640]   and here's why. And so what can happen is, this happened to me when I started studying personal
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.840]   finance, I was so sure of my answers. I was so sure I knew what to do because I'd read a few
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.640]   books that all agreed. And then I started doing it and then I started reading other books and
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.240]   getting other advice. And all of a sudden now I'm not so sure. And I think this is one of the most
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.760]   valuable things that we as financial advisors should be doing, is helping to apply for one
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:12.240]   individual person and say, "In your situation, based upon these goals and these objectives,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.320]   here's this fit that's right for you." So with the Roth IRA example, one of the first questions I ask
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:25.280]   is, "How much are you interested in putting into the Roth IRA this year?" Because the big problem
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:32.400]   with starting any account at a brokerage firm is a lot of them have asset minimums. And so,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:40.720]   for example, if you have $3,000, you can open a Roth IRA at Vanguard and choose a fund to put that
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.920]   in. But at Betterment, you can open a Roth IRA with $100 a month. So those are two totally
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.800]   different types of people that these mutual fund companies are appealing to.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:00.320]   - Do you see any companies working with advisors as intermediaries? And do you see that growing?
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.360]   - I do. Yeah, I think that there's a lot of advisors that are intimidated by the
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.080]   so-called robo-advisors. So when you're talking about people like Betterment, Motif,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.480]   you know, these types of firms that are popping up, and I think you're going to see more of a
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:27.200]   commoditization of the investments and working in conjunction with a financial planner. So I think
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.440]   that there's going to be a lot more financial planners that are using a robo-advisor to handle
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.840]   a lot of the investments, and they can then focus on the financial planning. Because what I tell
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.920]   people is 80% of what I do has nothing to do with investments. It's about making sure you have the
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:52.320]   right insurance products, making sure that you're maximizing your company benefits, that you have a
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.800]   credit card that's right for your situation, or that I can help you get out of credit card debt,
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.280]   or we figure out a plan for your federal student loans to make sure that you're set up for the
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:11.040]   right repayment program, that we talk through the pros and cons of buying a home. So there are all
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.480]   of these other things, including tax planning, insurance, estate planning, those kind of
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.960]   traditional things that we're then blending with some of these other topics that millennials are
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.880]   really coming to me and saying, "Hey, Sophia, this is really important. Can I ask you about this?"
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:33.920]   How important to you and your business has specialization of a specific type of client-based
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.240]   been in building your business? I love working with young clients.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.560]   So I've done a little bit of research on... There's been different studies that have come out,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.640]   and I give some presentations at financial planning conferences on working with younger clients.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.000]   And a couple of studies that I think are really interesting are that most people want to work with
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:06.640]   an advisor that's within 10 years of their age. And the average advisor age is 56. And I'm 31,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:14.320]   and all of my clients are within 10 years of my age. And so my clients range in age from about 24
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:24.080]   to 38, 39. And we can relate to each other. I get their world. And so I work with a variety of
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.960]   clients across the country, but I work with a lot of busy young professionals, people who are making
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:36.800]   good money, but have a lot of competing financial goals. So it's how do I balance paying off my
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   student loans while saving for a down payment on a house, while managing my own career that's
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:54.560]   growing, and figuring out what I should do in terms of should I contribute to a Roth IRA or a
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.400]   401k or the Roth 401k? And there's a lot of decisions that they have to make. And I love
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.960]   talking people through that. And still how to drive a car that's fancy enough to get a date,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:13.280]   right? It's so funny because the more I work with millennials, the more I work with young
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.520]   Gen Xers, the more I just love working with this client base because it's not all about
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.440]   retirement planning. And that's what the profession has been geared towards for so long.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.280]   And to me, it's like, I was so bored running retirement projections over and over and over
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.440]   again. And it's so much fun to work with clients that they come to me when they're engaged. And
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.800]   then six months later, they're married. And six months after that, one's going to grad school.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.960]   And six months after that, one's switching jobs. And six months after that, they're pregnant. And
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.320]   all of these life changes are happening. And to be able to be on that ride with them and help
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.520]   them navigate through some of those financial decisions that go along with those big life
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.360]   changes is really exciting. In your experience, do millennials view retirement differently than other
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:06.320]   generations? Yeah, I think so. I think we do. And I think we have to. And I don't think that's a bad
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.000]   thing. So my grandpa's retirement looks very different than my parents' retirement is going
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.880]   to. It looks very different from my retirement. And I think that a lot of people are saying that
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.520]   millennials aren't even thinking about retirement because they have so much debt.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.040]   But what I'm really seeing is people are interested in saving for the future. But I try to put the
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.000]   focus more on financial independence and creating financial independence because that can come at
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.880]   any age. It's not about you will retire at age 60. Well, if you retire at age 60 as a millennial,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.440]   you might live till you're 100. So what are you going to do for 40 years? So I think there's much
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:52.560]   more emphasis on what kind of career are you in? Do you like what you're doing? How do we get you
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:59.440]   in a job that's more enjoyable so that you can use your money to match your values to live your great
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.080]   life? And I'm seeing people actually, they're saying that millennials, new studies are coming
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.400]   out saying millennials are actually saving earlier than previous generations for things like
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:17.840]   retirement. And I think one of the reasons is because I'm having a lot of clients come to me
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.520]   saying, I watched my family go through a lot of hardship during these financial downturns and
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.920]   I don't want to be in the same situation. Or my parents are in a great position now financially
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.720]   and I want to be able to provide for my kids what my parents did. Can you help me do that?
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.880]   I think that millennials are very education minded. We're life learners. We really want
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.520]   that knowledge. We want to learn how do we do this? How do we figure this out? So a lot of people that
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.160]   are coming to me have already read personal finance blogs, listened to podcasts, done a
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.640]   lot of research on their own. And now they're like, okay, I'm ready to figure out how does
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.160]   this apply to me? What can I do better? Yeah. What's your financial independence plan?
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.240]   Ooh, that's so good. Why you got to ask the hard questions?
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:20.000]   God, I love that question. So I really love growing my business. I really believe that
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.960]   entrepreneurship's the new job security for my generation.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.680]   That's a good quote. I'll put a click to tweet entrepreneurship.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.400]   I have a blog post by that title.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.760]   Okay. There we go.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:42.400]   Yeah. I really believe that you are your own brand and millennials are switching jobs a lot
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:48.560]   more, but they're taking these great skills that they've learned at each job to the next job. And
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:57.280]   they're becoming highly specialized in certain areas and able to take this skill set and really
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:05.120]   become a valuable asset to their employer. But I'm also seeing people do that within their
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.320]   employer and really make themselves valuable. And I'm also seeing millennials say, "Hey,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.960]   I've been doing this for a while and now I'm ready to break off and do this on my own and
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:24.240]   really create a product, create a business, create a brand, create a company that can allow
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.360]   them more flexibility, can allow them to be in control of their time, to be in control of their
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.720]   income potential and live their great life." So for me, I really value being in control of my time
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.200]   and mobility. So I intentionally created Gen Y Planning as a location independent business,
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.400]   because I wanted to be able to work from anywhere. And what that allows is it allows my clients to
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.800]   be able to schedule client meetings at 7pm on a Tuesday night or 10am on a Saturday. But I also
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:02.400]   get to go to yoga at 1.30 on a Tuesday. And so before when you're working a 9 to 5 job or 8 to
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.480]   5, if you have a client meeting at 7, it means you work 8 to 8. And when you're working for yourself
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:14.560]   and you run your own company, it's a great way to be able to really design a lifestyle that works
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:21.040]   for you. So I can, you know, get up in the morning, check some email, head to yoga, go to a coffee
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:28.720]   shop in the afternoon, pump out a blog post, you know, check my Twitter, retweet some stuff, and
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.200]   then head home and have a client meeting from home and over Skype. And I really like setting up my
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:43.120]   life like that. Yeah. It's interesting because in many ways, we're very similar as far as our goals.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.920]   When I hear you say entrepreneurship is what I like, to me, I hear lifestyle business. And I
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:56.400]   can't come up with any other way around it. I don't think there is anything that is true
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:04.320]   financial independence and true passive income, except being able to live purely based off of
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.840]   the dividends of completely other people's labor with no other work. And I can't think of any way
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.120]   to do that, except with the dividends of probably publicly traded securities that have a whole team
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.480]   and a board of directors and are well regulated. But that doesn't mean that you necessarily have
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.440]   to wait until you have 25 times your annual income saved up in the bank. That's a good,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:32.080]   you know, goal and I'm working towards it. But in so many ways in today's world, the faster path to
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   autonomy is entrepreneurship. Absolutely. And so six and a half years ago, when I sat down and was
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.160]   looking at, I made a list of the five things I wanted in a job or business. It was after I got
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.480]   laid off, which is how I wound up in financial planning. One of those was I didn't want to be
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.040]   in the same place every day. And I wanted to be able to do this from where we do something from
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.080]   wherever I was. What was interesting in that different firm structure, I wasn't necessarily
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.280]   intentional about it in the beginning, in the sense that I was, you know, I put something like
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.760]   30 or 40,000 business miles on my car my first year, I was pounding the pavement, kind of the
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.560]   traditional door to not door to door, but the, you know, person to person, a lot of in person
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.800]   appointments. But over the six years from 2008 to 2014, the technology got so much better.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.480]   To it and I was I was working very hard on training my clients to actually prefer
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:38.320]   virtual meetings. And I think virtual meetings are actually better both for the advisor and for the
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.720]   client. Yes, thank you. That's what you preach, I guess, I gather. You know, that's what I found.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:50.320]   That's been my experience. But until you do that and have experience doing that, there's so much
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.160]   skepticism. Right. I think they're better for the client. Because, yeah, we it's all good to talk
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.920]   about what's good for the advisor. And that is important as a business owner. If my business
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.280]   doesn't work for me, I'm not going to keep doing it. So it's got to be good for the advisor. But
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.080]   the reason why I think it's better for the client, it takes first it does take time to go see the
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.880]   financial planner. And I've sat at enough tables at seven o'clock on Thursday night, I don't want to
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.960]   like that's not the phase of life I'm in. I want to be home with my wife. I want to be home with
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.920]   my kids hanging out. Like to me, evening times are important. So I would I always, you know,
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.960]   I would choose to meet at 6am instead of 7pm if I could do that. So we've all got to find something
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.120]   that works for us. But it's better for the client. They don't have to drive. And it's better to
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.040]   integrate, especially if you're working with spouses, where instead of husband coming from
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.640]   one place, wife coming from another, then each spouse can be on their computer at their job on a
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.520]   conference call. And another thing that I like about it is it's better for clients because instead
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.360]   of there being a focus on the relationship between me, the advisor and you, the client and exerting
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.480]   any kind of influence over here, make this decision, we're engaging with a written document.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.000]   And it's more likely that we're going to spend more time engaging with the facts instead of
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.800]   engaging with emotion. A lot of people have a big fear about the emotion of the advisor,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:12.480]   maybe especially if there's a sales capacity to the advisor's appointment, then I think a lot of
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.440]   that can be downplayed by working virtually. So I just see it as a total win. And the technology
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:23.280]   has gotten so much easier now that it provides for the kind of lifestyle you've outlined.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.520]   Yeah, so I do all my meetings over Skype or Google Hangout, which has worked out great.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:34.960]   And, you know, one of the things that I think is so much fun is I've met so many people's babies
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:42.320]   and pets over video chat, which has just been great. And super fun. Like you're meeting people
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.280]   in their homes in a relaxed environment, like nobody's dressed up, nobody expects you to,
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.320]   you know, be a certain way. Nobody expects you to be in a suit. It'd be weird if I was wearing a
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.840]   suit and I was on a video call. So I think that it just it's like you're meeting people where they're
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.800]   at. And you're meeting them at a time that's convenient for them. I used to joke that,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.760]   you know, meeting with a financial planner required you to take a half day off of work,
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:16.480]   required you to drive two hours, you know, drive a half hour to your financial planner's office
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:22.880]   to meet for two hours and then drive another half hour home. And I would say like you bring
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.800]   your shoebox full of documents that a para planner has to scan in. And that used to be my job.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:37.280]   And it's like instead my my clients are already getting online statements. So it's easy for them
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:43.600]   to just put that in an electronic folder that's a shared folder that we have set up. It's like
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:49.680]   why make them print that off, bring it to my office, have them, you know, have them have to
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:56.800]   take out all this extra time from work. And then I have to then scan it into my system and, you
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   know, organize it. And so a lot of what I'm doing is just what you're saying of like using technology
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:13.520]   in an efficient way to be able to, you know, really meet people where they're at. And, you know,
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:21.600]   technology has improved so much. I couldn't have done what I'm doing five years ago. I just couldn't.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.280]   Right. Totally agree. It was not possible five years ago.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:31.840]   And it was expensive because the technology that was out there was like, here's our CRM and it's
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.160]   two thousand dollars a year instead of my CRM, which is ten dollars a month.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:42.000]   Right. And here is our fancy. The big one for me was just being able to walk away from fancy class
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.760]   A office space and say, hey, listen, you know, I can work from a home office. Yeah, it's an extra
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:54.160]   bedroom, but that's that's fine. And Skype is free. I mean, we live in an amazing world. We really do.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.960]   Absolutely.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:03.760]   I want to ask you about your publicity, I guess, efforts and successes. Did you have a unique
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:10.160]   knowledge? So how have you been so effective at generating publicity?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:19.280]   So when I was working at the startup, I there was an editorial team and I became the liaison
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.480]   between the financial planning team and the editorial team. And so I would help edit a bunch
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:31.600]   of articles for like financial accuracy. So they would have a CFP take a look at the articles.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:38.000]   And I just got to know a lot of those people. And as I was leaving that company, a lot of
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.160]   them were as well. Some stuck around for a while and are now at other companies, but
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:49.440]   they remembered me. And so, you know, one is a writer for as a contributor for Forbes. Another
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:56.000]   one works at Business Insider. A handful are all freelance writers. And so part of it was just,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.160]   you know, being nice to people, helping people out early on. And then another thing I did
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.400]   was I answered Harrow ads. So I would, you know, just comb through a ton of the business and
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.240]   personal finance Harrow ads.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.440]   That is clip clarify. Harrow is help a reporter out, which is a service that you can sign up for.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.920]   And they send you a few emails a day just for those who don't know.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:24.960]   Yep. And it's free. And I was I would answer any at any basically what happens is a reporter's
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   doing a story or a freelance writer's doing a writing an article and they say, hey, I'm looking
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.960]   for an expert to talk about, you know, talking to millennials about money or how to save for,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.760]   you know, vacations or, you know, whatever it is, talking to your kids about money.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.520]   And so I started responding to those things. And so slowly, you know, I didn't care if it was,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:58.000]   you know, bankrate.com, Forbes.com or a small, you know, personal finance blog. I just really
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.560]   wanted to be able to start to get my name out there and be able to offer some expertise.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:11.040]   And pretty soon what happened was I got a couple of articles. It was quoted in a couple places that
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:17.760]   people that kept coming up in SEO search. So one article that I was that Laura Shin from Forbes
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.520]   interviewed me for was called 10 questions to ask when choosing a financial advisor.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.400]   Oh, nice.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:28.720]   And so that article was like, it's so funny. She just interviewed me for another article the other
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.360]   day. And I said, I've gotten clients from that article, Laura. And she said, it's so funny
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.760]   because when it was first published, it only got a couple thousand views. And now it has like over
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.840]   like 218,000 views.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.480]   That's amazing.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.480]   Because it keeps coming up in search. And so another article was I was named one of the top
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.880]   financial advisors for millennials by the blog moneyunder30.com. And that is another one that
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.240]   just keeps coming up in search. And I've had so many prospect calls and I've landed clients
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.480]   because of that article. So I think a big thing is you never really know what's going to be it.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:13.200]   But I would recommend signing up for HARO, which is helper reporter out. I would recommend getting
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.320]   to know personal finance bloggers and offering your expertise there. So I was writing a lot of
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.920]   guest posts for free for financial bloggers that had a similar target demographic that I wanted to
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:30.240]   reach. And that was a great way for me to be able to gain some new newsletter subscribers,
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.880]   more Twitter followers and slowly build my brand.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   So in the first couple of years of your business, it's nice that you have that marketing now. It's
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.320]   nice that there's a Forbes article that sits out there and just sends leads to you. But in the
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.440]   first couple of years, were you actually prospecting, meaning asking, you know, prospecting
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.880]   in some kind of proactive way, asking clients for introductions, going out doing something that was
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:01.280]   more of a short term way to acquire clients? No. So and I'm still in the first couple of
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:08.720]   years of my business. So I only launched in May of 2013. But my big way to get prospects was
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:16.080]   I wanted to, when you thought of financial planning and Gen Y, I wanted you to think of Gen
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:22.400]   Y planning. Which is a brilliant name, by the way. Thank you. I'm hoping to repeat that with
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.480]   my choice of radical personal finance as the name. Exactly. And it's just I wanted to be able to
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.080]   provide really useful content, really helpful information that would cause people to think,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.720]   you know, if she's providing that for free, I wonder what it's like to work with Sophia one
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:46.240]   on one. I think it's just fascinating how and the reason I brought that up is because I have heard
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:54.080]   many intelligent leaders in the financial advice industry talk about how marketing is just simply
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:01.440]   doesn't work. And the challenge is that it seems as though at least my experience was a lot of
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:10.480]   times I would rather talk to a client. It was hard to find clients who would, let me try to make sure
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:18.560]   I'm being clear. It's hard to find clients who are in a specific place where they're able to help you
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:24.880]   because it seems as though many people in society are not proactive about planning. And so the time
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.840]   they call and want to buy life insurance is when they've just been diagnosed with cancer. And the
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.520]   time they want to call and do retirement planning is when they're 62 years old. And it's sorry,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.440]   you know, there's not much we can do. Maybe we can do a little bit of social security optimization
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.800]   planning, but that's about it. So the beat, the drumbeat that's beat in the financial business is
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.840]   that prospecting is what works and prospecting is a proactive scenario used to be. If you were a
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   stockbroker, you made 400 or 600 cold calls a day. The way that I did it was the old fashioned
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.560]   system of friend to friend, a friend to friend, constantly asking for what we called qualified
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.120]   introductions to somebody that you know, that you think highly of. And then that gets you on
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.240]   the radar screen of somebody that gets you on somebody's radar screen to where you're there
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.600]   and you're thought of when they're going through a transition phase. But I think that I think that's
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:24.480]   still valid, but I see a change happening and I see a change culturally where because now I as an
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:31.040]   individual can connect with any other individual in the world that makes it more possible to do
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.640]   marketing. Yeah. I mean, when you were talking about prospecting and what that's meant to you
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.840]   or what that's meant to financial advisors previously, that's my newsletter list, right?
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:48.320]   Like that's how I, that's how I feel my like view my newsletter list. I think, you know, I want my
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:54.960]   prospects to come to me. I want them to be seeking out, you know, if you Google financial planner for
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:00.000]   millennials or financial planner for Gen Y, I'm the top Google search, you know, and people will
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.280]   tell me that they were Googling like financial planners for young couples and you know, eventually,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.200]   you know, like I'll pop up, they'll find me through a couple, what'll happen is they'll
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.840]   Google something and then maybe they don't come to my website right away, but maybe they come to an
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:20.800]   article that I wrote. So I'm, you know, in the top page of, of search for, I wrote an article
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.920]   called, should I contribute to a 401k or a Roth IRA? And that's a question that a lot of people
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:31.120]   have. People would stumble across that article. Then they would start checking out my website
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.680]   or people would stumble across a Forbes article or an investment news article and, you know,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.440]   start following me on Twitter and then they find my website, then they might sign up for my
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.920]   newsletter. And, you know, I had clients recently become clients that had been on my newsletter list
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.800]   for six months, then did a prospect call with me, then three months later, you know, signed their
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.280]   contract and we're ready to move forward. So sometimes people have been kind of, you know,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:02.000]   watching you or courting you or, you know, for a long time and you might not realize it,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.040]   but I want them to jump on board when they're ready. I don't want people to ever feel like,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:13.360]   um, uh, I never wanted to be like a pushy salesperson. I always wanted to be able to
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.640]   feel like they wanted the value that I could provide and they were ready for that and they're
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.680]   ready to invest in that. And I know that financial planning is a big investment and that a lot of
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:34.800]   people, um, it's a big decision. And so I just, I wasn't comfortable with, um, you know, I, I just
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:42.560]   hate things like breakfast meetings. I think that's just not my idea. Like I just don't like
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:49.280]   sleazy sales things. I like connection. I like relationships. I mean, I have friends, close
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:55.840]   friends that I met through their blogs online, you know, and that's something that like a lot
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:01.120]   of baby boomers don't understand. Right. You know, I met my friend Paula Pant from the afford
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.840]   anything blog because I started her blog. I started following her blog online and then a
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.400]   couple of months, you know, I'd sent her a, uh, email like, Hey, I love your blog. Here's a little
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.040]   bit about me. You seem really cool. We're the same age. We have a bunch in common, blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.280]   A couple of months later, she sends me an email cause she saw me quoted in money magazine.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.160]   Now we had to be two of the few women in our mid twenties that were reading money magazine.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.680]   I hope there's much more now. But, um, but it was just so funny. So we just, we had all of these
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.600]   connections. We both love personal finance. We were both only children. We both had rental
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:43.920]   properties. We, you know, and so when I went to speak at a conference in Atlanta, I said, Hey,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   I'm going to be in town. I'm thinking about hanging out in Atlanta for a few days. You know,
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.640]   where should I stay? Should I rent a car? And she, she was like, Oh, you'll just stay with me
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.800]   and I'll just take you around and we'll either way through Atlanta. And so it's like, those are
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.720]   the type of relationships that my clients have. Like they have close connections with people
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.600]   from all across the world. You know, a lot of my clients, um, are used to Skyping with their
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.400]   families and other countries or in other States. So it's not weird to Skype with your financial
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.680]   planner because they feel like you can build that close connection and relationship, whether we're
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.080]   in the same room or not. Right. Yeah. It's a, it's, it's a changing world and it's really amazing how
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:36.960]   the virtual relationships can turn into in-person relationships, which can then switch around. Same
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.160]   thing with, I read Paula's blog. I invited her on the show. She was actually my second interview
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.360]   that I ever did for radical personal finance. And I felt so bad because I had published her
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.400]   episode and then I had to pull the show down. But then I met, finally met her at FinCon. And
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.240]   so then the virtual relationships go to personal relationships. And what's so powerful and the
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.880]   re thing I see about marketing is if you can build a connection with people that really get who you
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:12.960]   are and they can be allowed to, especially as clients self-select over time, that's powerful
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.600]   because you don't have to, you can just be yourself. You don't have to portray a persona.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:24.800]   I came to the point where I just despise wearing suits. Right. I just want to be Sophia. Sophia
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.040]   on Twitter is going to be the same as Sophia in person is going to be the same as Sophia,
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.480]   my financial planner. I don't want to have to be like, this is professional business, Sophia. And
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:43.520]   she uses this other voice. This is fun, Sophia. I remember getting into financial planning and
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.240]   having to buy suits and dressing up to go to the office. And I felt like I was faking it until I
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   made it. And I'm just so over that. Right. Yeah. I'm with you. I live in Florida and suits were
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.440]   invented to keep people warm and up north. Why on earth do I wear a suit in Florida?
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.600]   But it's kind of expected. Same reason I don't want to wear heels in the snow in Minnesota.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.760]   Exactly. But with the ability to market yourself, you can have people simply choose. And
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.840]   there's very little chance that I'm going to be a good fit for a high powered
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:25.600]   litigator in Miami because I just don't really like the Miami lifestyle. But I love sitting
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.080]   around the back of a pickup truck talking with a multimillion dollar farmer. That's who I
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:36.080]   enjoy being with. And so you can you can self select. Yeah. And I think another thing, too,
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:43.920]   is that like. So when you look at kind of where the financial planning profession grew out of,
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:50.720]   it grew out of either like these old CPA firms or these old insurance firms. Right. And so these
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:57.920]   were all geared to serve rich old white guys. None of my clients are rich old white guys,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:04.720]   so I can't keep doing the same things to serve my demographic. Like people are asking for virtual
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   meetings. They're wanting to be able to, you know, have flexible meeting times. They want to be able
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:16.160]   to have email support with me. They you know. And so there's just a different way of us interacting
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.840]   because it works for them. It works for my generation. It works for their lifestyle.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:25.600]   I think they're, you know, culturally you have such you know, my clients are such an amalgamation
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:31.200]   of cultures that I have a lot of clients who speak a second language in the home. I have a
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.920]   lot of clients who, you know, are multicultural. And so it's it's also, you know, being aware of
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.440]   that. You know, I'm talking to clients, too, about there are certain expectations depending on
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:49.920]   ethnicity, culture and whatnot of I'm going to like they'll say to me, like, I'm probably going
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.400]   to have to take care of my mom or I'm planning on, you know, at some day we'll be you know,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.200]   we'll financially need to help my parents out. So planning for that, which is something that,
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:06.880]   you know, so many people are talking about baby boomers still, you know, paying for the millennial
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:14.160]   generation. And I'm seeing like the flip side of that, too, of, you know, these immigrant parents
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:19.120]   worked really hard, sent their kids to college and their retirement plan is like they'll move back in
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.360]   with their kids. They'll take care of their grandbabies and, you know, their their kids will
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:30.720]   help support them in retirement. Yeah, I agree. It which in many ways is a more secure retirement
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:41.520]   plan than being concerned about market volatility. I hate asking about demographic questions because
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:48.320]   I'm pretty much blind to most of that stuff. But I get flack. I've gotten flack from the audience
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.400]   because I don't bring enough women on the show. And I honestly never even think about like,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.960]   is this person a man or are they a woman or are they black? Are they white? I don't even consider
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.320]   something in between. I don't even consider I just think they have an interesting story.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:09.200]   But out of deference, I will ask the question is what's it this industry is full of old white guys.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:16.880]   Is it been have you has there been any barrier to you as a young woman? What's your been your
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:22.880]   experience? Yeah. So my background is in theater and women's studies. So it's definitely something
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:29.680]   that I noticed. OK, so I think that it's it's funny to me because a lot of my my friends that
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.080]   are, you know, young white dudes in this profession are like, I just don't even think about this stuff.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:41.680]   And I'm like, I know you don't because and that's awesome that you don't. But it's it's interesting.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.040]   So I think there's a couple of interesting things that are happening. One, I feel like
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:54.960]   I feel I felt like there's certain I think just being so there's a couple of different things to
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:01.440]   break down. I think one is like being young in the profession. Sometimes it's like, oh,
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.480]   you're so cute. Look at you doing your cute little financial thing and not like a real
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:13.040]   financial planning. You know, it's like that's how I felt. I felt like if I for a while I thought I
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:20.000]   could start working with young clients within a firm, within an already established firm.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.440]   But I quickly realized that they would never view me as like a real financial planner. I would I
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:32.720]   would it would be. They I was their kids age, they thought of me too much as like this,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:39.760]   you know, oh, that's so that's so cute what Sophia is doing with her three clients, you know.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:48.640]   And and now I think that it's I think that age and gender can really be an asset in this
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:57.200]   profession and can really set you apart. But I do think that there's a long way to go to make
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.360]   this profession more attractive to women and young people and minorities. And so as much as it's an
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.000]   asset to be like a young woman in this profession, because I do think I have some unique things to
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.040]   bring to the table, I think I could, you know, I'm the conversations that I have with my clients
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:21.840]   are, you know, more, you know, they're a little different. They're a little bit more focused on
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.400]   removing the person from the problem, not focusing on the hard numbers as much as the,
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.360]   you know, how do you want to live your great life, that kind of thing.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.800]   So I think that there are some unique things that I bring to the profession. But I think that
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:43.200]   we still haven't educated young people enough about how the impact they could have on working
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:51.040]   with their peers or working with other minorities or other women or other young people by just
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:56.480]   coming into this profession and getting their CFP and launching their own firm or working at other
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:03.440]   firms and being able to really educate other people as well about here's how to be culturally
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:08.560]   sensitive towards your clients. And here's some things, you know, to think about. And
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.280]   here's some things to not say to women, like when I go to financial planning conferences, and,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.240]   you know, people are like, Oh, are you married? You know, and like, what is your, you know,
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.160]   what does your husband do? And, oh, do you have kids? And like, that's like, what, you know, what
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.720]   people like the things that come out of people's mouths are like, why don't, you know, like, it's,
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:34.800]   it's so strange. It's so funny to me. And then a lot of times I'll get like the, Oh, who do you
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:41.200]   work for? Oh, I actually run my own company. Oh, that's interesting. You know, people are really
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.680]   surprised that this this young woman is like, running her own financial planning firm.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.480]   Do you think that's actually a gender difference? Because people ask me those same questions.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:56.880]   Yeah. Um, well, I think that's, I think yes, and no, I think sometimes it's just,
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:03.920]   sometimes it's just like, just the age we are, right. And I think that other times it's,
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:12.880]   so I think a lot of women feel like they have to do it all and they have to be perfect. And they
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:20.640]   have to put on this persona of like, I have to be like the perfect, you know, wife or mom,
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:26.000]   and I have to be a great businesswoman and I have to be this or that. And so I think there's a lot
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.880]   of pressure there. And I don't know if that's, I hear that a lot from my female friends. And I
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:41.040]   don't know if that's different for men. But I know that it's, it seems to me that there's not as much
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:51.600]   um, I don't know, like, it's really interesting. It's just like really interesting culturally of
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:58.640]   like what are like at this age you do this or like this is when, you know, right. So I think all of
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:03.280]   these are things that conversations that we should continue to have, because I think that a lot of
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.000]   people are afraid to explore these topics. And I think that the more that we talk about these topics
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:17.440]   and talk about gender and, and ethnicity and, you know, coming from different cultures coming from,
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.800]   you know, my dad's first generation, my, my grandparents were Polish immigrants, you know,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:28.720]   and what is, what are those types of things, you know, what are the money scripts from that culture
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.520]   that were passed down to you from that generation. I think that all of those things play a factor in
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:39.120]   who we are. And when you can start to break down those barriers, and, you know, really talk to
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.240]   people and ask them, hey, tell me about this, tell me about how, you know, having immigrant parents
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.840]   affected, you know, your relationship with money. I think those are really interesting questions.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:55.680]   And I think we should continue to explore them. So I'm asking another question about gender roles.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.400]   Yeah, because I'm interested in if you have a background in women's studies, you're a great
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.680]   person to talk to. Or at least theoretically, you should be a great person to talk to if we can
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.160]   trust the certification. I'm a feminist with a sense of humor.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:14.560]   Okay, good. Do you think it's, do you think it's unfair to it? Well, that's,
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.080]   that's a poor way to wear the question. Here's a question. Do you think that
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:25.200]   women feel more pressure, like they have to, in order to be successful and accepted,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:36.960]   they have to compete in the workforce? I, that's, that's a tough one. I feel like
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:45.200]   we have to have all of our ducks in a row. And in order to compete with our male counterparts,
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:52.800]   sometimes, like, I feel like we have to be like, just as smart and just as good,
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.400]   but then like a little bit better. Like, I feel like we have to bring like a little something
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:03.200]   special to the table to be able to like stand out. We can't just like, I feel like the bar
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:10.400]   is a little bit higher to set ourselves apart and to prove our worth. So I don't know if,
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.040]   I don't know why. Do you think,
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:22.720]   so the word compete is interesting. Do you think women or men of our generation ever think of
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.200]   simply cooperating with their male counterparts? Well, I think you're seeing more of that. And to
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:33.360]   me, that's really exciting because you're actually seeing the gender or the wage gap close in
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:41.600]   millennials for, for like the, the gender wage gap. So basically a lot of times in previous
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:47.040]   generations, like women had earned 70 cents on the dollar. When you look at, you know, wages,
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.480]   women and men doing the same job, but you're actually seeing that become like women are
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.120]   earning, I don't know, it's somewhere in like the 90, like 90 cents on the dollar.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:03.520]   So you're seeing that close a lot. And I think that women are graduating from college
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   at higher rates than men are. They're getting higher. They're graduating at the top of their
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:16.480]   class. They're getting, you know, graduating with honors. But I also think that I do think we're
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.400]   starting to work together more. And I've noticed that like, just in launching my firm and my
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:31.120]   business, the, both the women and the men that I work with, like other advisors that I know,
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.400]   we send each other clients, we refer each other clients, we help each other get press,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:44.240]   we collaborate because I really believe that I just, I think I believe in the abundance mentality
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.880]   and not the scarcity mentality. And I think for so long, financial planning was this really
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:55.840]   competitive, like cutthroat business where people, like you said, had to compete for clients where
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.680]   there were only so many clients to go around because you had these high minimums, there was a
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:07.840]   high, you know, barrier to entry. And now I feel like there's so many, so many possible clients
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.320]   out there. People are helping each other. They're saying like, "Hey, I want you to be successful."
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.200]   Like I say, you know, there's 70 million millennials and if a million of them want a
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.320]   financial planner, that's great, but I don't want a million clients. So I need other people to do
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:27.920]   this too. You know, like I'm really encouraging of other advisors, you know, launching their own firm
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:36.320]   and being able to, you know, build their brand and set themselves apart because, you know,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:43.120]   I joke that like Gen Y is not a target. It's not going to be a target market in a few years,
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.920]   just like how, you know, women, you know, they make up half of the population. That's not really
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:53.680]   like a niche market. You know, Gen Y makes up what, a third of the population or, you know,
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.800]   more like, that's not really a niche. I'm going to have to be like, you know, the Gen Y person
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:04.160]   that specializes in entrepreneurs, bloggers and, you know, and whatnot. And just like have it be
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.720]   really specific because all of these other great financial planners will have entered the space
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:13.680]   and said, I'm the financial planner for young lawyers. I'm the financial planner for young,
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.520]   you know, nurse anesthetists, you know, it's going to be like that specific.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.760]   But to me, I think it's just a really exciting time to be in the profession because I think we're
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.040]   on the cusp of a major change for a few reasons. And part of that is because of technology,
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:35.520]   like you mentioned earlier. Another part of that is that we're changing our fee structure. A lot
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:41.520]   more of us are having a, you know, a fee structure that's on a monthly retainer that's more accessible
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:48.240]   for people or more affordable for people. And then, you know, you're seeing these big,
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.960]   these practices transition to younger generations too, you know, as financial planners are getting
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:58.880]   older, they're going to have to figure out what they want to do with their practice.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   So we'll see. But I think it's an exciting time. And I'm excited for more. I mean, we need more
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:12.320]   young, cool, awesome, fun, interesting financial planners that have unique backgrounds that can
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:19.600]   communicate across cultures, across generations, and are willing to work with a variety of different
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:28.080]   clients and make their unique stamp in the world. So funny to me that you earlier, much earlier in
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.600]   the interview you let out was saying, I love working with young people. That's funny. I'm
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:37.200]   the exact opposite. Give me retirees any day. I've, they have always called me an old soul.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.080]   And I was the, I was the kid in high school that I'd spend more time hanging out with my friends,
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:47.840]   parents than I did with my friends at the pool party. And so what I found is I loved working.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:53.840]   I love, I still do like my favorite type of financial planning to do it's retirement planning,
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.600]   working with somebody in their fifties and their sixties and their seventies.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:05.440]   Like, so I think the key is for us as advisors to know who we would enjoy working with and then,
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.320]   and then target them. Yeah. Well, I was, and so one thing that's been really interesting
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.920]   that I didn't expect was how many referrals I would get from other financial planners,
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.720]   because once they found out that I was working with young clients and specializing in it,
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:23.200]   all of a sudden these, I was speaking at these conferences and these older advisors were sending
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:30.000]   me their clients' kids because they're like, Hey, you do this all the time. You know, I really think
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.960]   that you'd be a great fit for them. Right. And I'll make one point and get asked. My final
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.360]   question is going to be just cause we did talk so much about kind of gender roles. My final question
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.880]   is going to be in a, what could the financial planning industry do differently or what could
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:49.040]   financial, many financial advisor and frankly, anybody who's listening that would like to
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:55.760]   be more accommodating to, to other people do. So that's, that's what I'll ask in a moment, but
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.320]   I guess the point I was going to make is I get a little bit bitter about some of the
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:06.000]   bitter, bitter in a gentle way. Bitter is probably too strong of a word. I get a little bit frustrated
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.880]   at the expectations that are put on people of any type. And one of the things that I personally
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:23.520]   resent a little bit is how our society puts, seems to put so much pressure on women to have to do it
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:33.680]   all. And the, I'm my, my personal philosophy is allow someone to stand on their own two feet and
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.000]   you live according to what, how you want to live and let me live how, according to how I want to
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.360]   live. But I've watched, for example, like just the, the pressure on my wife, like my wife, she's my
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.880]   wife and that's what she loves to do. And that's what she loves to be. She doesn't need a job to
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.800]   define her. And I resent it when people put that on her. I don't want her to have to go out and
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:04.080]   have to get a job. And I feel like I've worked with so many clients actually. And I've worked
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.960]   with, see, each person is a unique individual. And I've worked with clients that are every stage,
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.720]   I've worked with some clients, men and women who love their work. They love what they do. And for
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.280]   them, it's a very important part of their identity. And I've worked with other people who don't want
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:25.440]   to be involved with their work and it's not a part of their identity. And so that good example of
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:32.640]   that was my wife. And so all of society puts this pressure on her that says, you've got to do it
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.800]   all. You've got to be able to compete in the workforce and you've got to be Miss Professional
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.680]   and you've got to be Super Mom and you've got to be super this and super that. And I say, I'm sorry,
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.880]   but I don't accept that. And what's funny is, and perhaps the counter, the rebuttal to this
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.200]   argument, people say, well, it's about time that, cause you know, women have been squashed for so
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.160]   long and fine. I'll grant the point and let someone else argue. It's not, it's not something that's
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.200]   that, that I particularly care to get involved in. But now on the flip side, there's the reverse
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:07.600]   side where she constantly has to feel like when somebody comes against her and says, Oh, you're
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.080]   a stay at home mom. Like, yeah, I'm a stay at home mom. And for me, I can't imagine any more
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.840]   important job for her. And that was one of the things that before marriage, like when, when,
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.560]   when we were talking about marriage, for one of the things that was important for me is I don't
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.520]   want to compete with my wife. I'm not in a competition with my wife. I'm in a marriage
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.960]   with my wife. And so that means we, uh, we have different roles and I don't care how anyone else
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.520]   wants to do it, but I resent society coming and saying, well, you've got to be super mom. I don't
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.400]   under, like, I am amazed at some of the ladies that I have worked with of how capable they are
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.040]   to juggle things. I'm amazed. I think frankly, women are naturally more capable things than men.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:57.440]   That's the only way that, that you can, can do all the things that, that, that you do. And so I am
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.880]   awed by the Cape, the raw capability, uh, that I think women have. And I just want people to be
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:11.600]   free. You make your own decision for your life and let me and my family live our life according
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.440]   to the way that we want to live them. And I'll let you live your life the way that you want to live
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.400]   them. Uh, but we seem, it's certainly an interesting, uh, an interesting time in which we
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.880]   live in where this, all this tension in our society and all these competing, uh, competing
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.560]   viewpoints. I'm, I'm a little fascinated by it. I'll give you the last word on that subject. So,
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.320]   uh, to make sure that you have an opportunity just to, to make any comment from your perspective.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.840]   Yeah. So I went to this great conference and it's called the world domination summit and it's in
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.800]   Portland every year. And the whole theme of the conferences, how do we live a remarkable life
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.400]   in a conventional world? And I think about that a lot because I'm building a location,
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:56.000]   independent business and people think that's weird. Right. And, um, I want to live, uh, you
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.680]   know, a few months in a few different places this year. Right. And that's weird. And so pushing back
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:08.480]   against some of those cultural norms of, um, is, is really challenging sometimes. And I think that
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.280]   that's one of the things that you're experiencing of feeling like, okay, so now the, the, you know,
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.600]   it's like the feminist movement happened. And so you can have a job and you can work in the world
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.560]   and you can be a mom. And then it's like, but she's choosing to like, live this great life
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:33.200]   with her kids, enjoy your time with her kids and be a great stay at home parent. And that's awesome.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.520]   But for some reason, there's still all these societal pressures or be like, but you could
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.840]   have a job and you could be working outside the home. And she's like, I know I could be,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.680]   but like, this is what's really important for me and my family. And this is what we chose.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.400]   And so I think that there's a lot of, um, I just think that it's like, it's, it's never right.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.040]   Right. Like, it's like, you can't, you can't please everyone. I mean, tons of my friends
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.760]   have had kids in the last year and it's like, are you breastfeeding? Are you not? How long are you
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:08.960]   breastfeeding for? Are you, I'm like, people are crazy. Like people that don't know you touch your
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:16.000]   belly. Like that's weird. You know, like, I don't know who said that was okay. Um, so I think there's
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.360]   a lot of weird societal things that we as, as a culture are kind of up against. Um, but I think
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:29.280]   in terms of kind of women in the financial planning profession, um, just continuing to promote women
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:35.920]   in this profession is great. So, um, I still go to a lot of conferences where 90% of the presenters
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:43.600]   are men and you know, 80% of them are over age 50. Um, so I just, one of the things that I like
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:51.920]   to emphasize is, um, promoting diversity within financial planning. And that can be a, in my eyes,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:56.960]   means a bunch of different things. So not only minorities, but also women, also young people,
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.320]   just mixing it up so that there's different people presenting different topics and it's not
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.680]   social security withdrawal strategies and long-term care for the 20th time, you know,
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:16.160]   and I think that, um, you're also going to see, um, like these conferences have to start shaking
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.720]   it up a little bit more and adding different elements, right. Adding, maybe they add some
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.760]   music, maybe they add, you know, maybe they don't do everything in PowerPoints. Maybe they have
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:31.920]   shorter sessions that are 20 minute Ted X style presentations instead of hour long CE credit
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:38.080]   presentations only. Um, but also I think that, you know, one of the things that, that I love
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.440]   about this profession is the flexibility, is being in control of your time that you can ramp up hours
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:50.160]   and you can also scale back. And I, I hope that that will become attractive to women who want to
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.120]   have families as well, because they'll be like, look, I can be a financial planner, but that
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.320]   doesn't mean that I have to work 60 hour weeks. That might mean that I run a smaller lifestyle
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:07.520]   practice where I work 20 hours a week or I work 30 hours a week. Um, you know, like right now I
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:13.520]   work about 30 hours a week and I love that. That's a really good fit for me. I do yoga five
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.120]   times a week. I travel a lot. Um, I call them work-cations cause it's usually some combination
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:25.280]   of visiting friends and speaking at a conference or going to a conference or, uh, meeting clients
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:31.680]   in other places. And so I just think that the more options we can give people, like you said,
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.640]   and not putting these labels or these restrictions on people of what they're supposed to do. I mean,
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:42.880]   I hate the word should, like you should do this. Like why, you know, why are you at this conference?
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.240]   You just had a baby two months ago. You should be at home. Are you, you know, those types of things,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:55.040]   um, versus like you should be doing that. Uh, you know, it's like who, who made those rules?
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.600]   I don't know. I was raised by hippie parents. So maybe I just kind of like naturally I'm like
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:06.320]   rules. What? Like, why would you have a rule about that? Um, and so I just think that this
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:12.000]   is a really important time that like you were mentioning earlier about, you know, collaborating
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.320]   instead of competing. It's like, how can we support each other to really build the practices
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.400]   that we want? Um, create the lives that we want, build the brand that we want on our own terms,
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.240]   in our own way. And, um, I think there's more and more of an opportunity to do that. And what's
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.680]   really fun is that in the past couple of years, I'm finding those people that get me, that get
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:41.040]   my world, that support the work that I do, that get the lifestyle that I want. And I don't have
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.600]   time for anybody else. Like I just, I'm like, all right, like have fun doing your thing. But like
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.760]   me and my friends over here, you know, shaking up the financial planning profession and it's awesome.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.520]   Yeah. Lead by example. It's always, it's the way to do it. I think those of us who are in a
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:06.480]   position of strength do have a responsibility to help those who can't help themselves. And that's,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.720]   for me, it's a moral responsibility. But if you can help yourself a little bit, the best way to
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:20.240]   do things, make changes, just ignore everyone and go make the change. I'm going to ask one more
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.240]   thing. And just cause it was, I wanted to point it out, but much earlier you were talking about
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.960]   the connection and what you're, how you're doing kind of the coaching. I just think it's,
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.280]   there's a world of possibility in our future. And one thing that's exciting is to blend
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   traditional financial planning with internet marketing, internet techniques. You're selling
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:50.160]   an info product, you're creating another info product, right? So you're like blending marketing
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.120]   coaching. That's a lot of what good financial planning is, is life coaching and career
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.000]   coaching. And all of these things are coming together through the lens of finance. And that's
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.160]   one thing I think we need more of is not keeping financial planning relegated to the stupid asset
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.520]   allocation conversation. Great. It does need to be done, but a much more important conversation
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.240]   is the life allocation question. Exactly. I mean, I'm actually, one of the things I'm thinking about
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:22.240]   is going through some life coach training because so much of what I do is career planning and life
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:28.880]   planning and helping people figure out how to take the next steps in their career, in their life, in
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.840]   what they want to do, where they want to be. And so those things just intersect so much.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.360]   GenYPlanning.com, anywhere else you want people to find you or anything else you want to tell
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.480]   about? Yeah. So my new ebook came out called What You Should Have Learned About Money,
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:50.160]   But Never Did, a Gen Y Guide to Empowered Personal Finance. And you can look it up in the Amazon
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.160]   Kindle store. And then if you're a financial advisor and you're listening to this podcast,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.120]   and you're interested in learning more about how I built my brand, digital marketing and social
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:05.600]   media, I'm launching a new training course with another financial planner named Jude Boudreaux.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:13.360]   And that's called SocialFinancialPlanner.com. And it's going to be a six module online course.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   And the first round is actually starting on March 2nd. So check that out too. Thanks so much.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.400]   Thanks for coming on.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.000]   This was awesome. Thank you for having me.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.040]   I'm excited to watch what happens over the coming years as Sophia continues to build her practice.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.800]   She is in many ways blazing a trail and there are several advisors who are kind of following
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.160]   in her footsteps. But I'm definitely excited to see what happens over the coming years
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:49.840]   to see if things work. I think they will. But there's always a need for trailblazers to set
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.480]   out with these new practice models. Hopefully that's been an inspiration to you. Hopefully
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:01.680]   you enjoyed some of that content. If you have any interest in financial planning, then one of my
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.040]   goals with bringing you a couple of these interviews, especially this one here, was to
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:12.240]   show you how you really can find a niche. And you can be true to yourself and true to your goals and
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.040]   true to who you are and what you want to do. You don't necessarily have to go and work with people
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.840]   that you don't want to work with. In many ways, Sophia and I are exactly the opposite ends of the
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.760]   spectrum as far as what we enjoy. I like working with retirees. I like that kind of in-depth
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.560]   financial planning, but she doesn't. And the great thing is that each of us has the opportunity to
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.360]   work with people that we want to work with. So for you, is there somebody like that that you would
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.800]   like to... Do you have an idea of the type of person that you would like to be able to serve
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:49.440]   and to help? If so, the financial planning industry is wide open to you. And even as you've heard,
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.320]   I mean, I'll tell you, I've not been to a conference for years where there hasn't been
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:01.040]   all these extra panels and whatnot on diversity. And the industry is working very hard to bring in
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:08.000]   a lot of a more diverse look to the planners. If you are a lady and you're interested in financial
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.560]   planning, man, the doors are wide open to you at every firm I've ever talked to and every person
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:19.360]   I've ever talked to. So feel free to check it out. It's certainly a business that I think can serve
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.360]   very well as a lifestyle business and can be integrated very well with many aspects of life.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.480]   I know of several financial advisors that I know of here in West Palm Beach who are moms,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:36.000]   who have kids, and they were established in their business before having kids because that's one of
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.920]   the challenges of getting going. But once you're going, it really is a great industry and a great
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.960]   business because you can incorporate it into your lifestyle. So hopefully this was inspirational to
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   you. Thank you all so much for listening for today. Tomorrow I'll be back with your Q&A.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.560]   That's the plan for tomorrow. If you'd like to ask a question, just email me,
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, or leave a voicemail. If this has been helpful to you,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.520]   I'd appreciate your supporting the Patreon campaign. We are currently up to 40 patrons
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.680]   and $389 a month on our way to $6,000 a month by June 1 so we can keep the show commercial free.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.200]   I'd love to do that for you. That's it. I'm out. Enjoy. Have a great day.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.280]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.320]   I guess I should tell you. Radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron. Now I'm out.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.640]   Thank you for listening to today's show. If you'd like to contact me personally,
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:31.680]   my email address is joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. You can also connect with the show on Twitter
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:39.760]   @radicalpf and at facebook.com/radicalpersonalfinance. This show is intended to provide entertainment,
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:48.080]   education, and financial enlightenment, but your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:54.880]   actionable advice without knowing anything about you. Please, develop a team of professional
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:03.120]   advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and trustworthy, and consult them because they
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:10.480]   are the ones who can understand your specific needs, your specific goals, and provide specific
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.880]   answers to your questions. I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.840]   but I'm one person and I make mistakes. If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.640]   please help me by coming to the show page and commenting so we can all learn together.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.920]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here. The LA Kings Holiday Pack is back,
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:37.120]   the perfect gift for the hockey fan in your life. A three-game pack starts at just $159
