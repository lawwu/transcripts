[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.640]   the Gospel according to St. Luke in the first chapter, and verses 54 and 55.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.840]   Verses 54 and 55 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.840]   He hath holpen his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy, as he spake to our fathers,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.840]   to Abram, and to his seed for ever.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.520]   We had better perhaps just correct that reading which I have taken here from the authorized
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.020]   version that is in front of me.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.320]   The first phrase in verse 55, "as he spake to our fathers," should really be in brackets.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.960]   So we read like this.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.560]   He hath holpen his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy to Abram, and to his seed for
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.840]   ever, as he spake to our fathers.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.160]   The correction is important for this reason only, that the authorized translation gives
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.360]   the impression that the reference to Abram and to his seed is a continuation of the speaking
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.220]   to the fathers, that is in a sense perfectly true, as we shall see.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.100]   But the main idea here is that he hath holpen his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.520]   to Abram, and to his seed for ever, as he spake to our fathers.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.120]   We come back in other words to a further consideration of this section of Scripture which is generally
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:59.720]   described as the Magnificat, this extraordinary statement made or sung by the Virgin Mary
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.160]   after she had been saluted by Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.720]   It is, as we were indicating last Sunday, both morning and evening, a most astonishing
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.320]   utterance, particularly when you look at it from the standpoint of seeing in it a summary
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.000]   of the salient and the basic features of the Christian message, the Christian gospel, the
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Christian faith.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.760]   Now last Sunday morning we were looking at it in this way, and from this standpoint,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.120]   the way in which Mary seems to see that the thing that overshadows everything else is
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.440]   the manifestation of the character of God in the coming of his Son into this world.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:03:00.080]   My soul doth magnify the Lord, and, as she says, my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.320]   And we saw how she goes on to indicate how some of the attributes of God's person and
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.840]   character have been laid manifest and bare before us in the great event and fact of the
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   Incarnation.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.800]   So, with the whole of our being, her soul and spirit, she praises God and magnifies
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.520]   his great and holy name.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.360]   Then last Sunday evening, I say this for the benefit of those who are not present, there
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.120]   we saw in a striking manner how Mary here has seen immediately the great characteristic
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.000]   of the gospel, how it is the reversal of everything that men would ever have thought of.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.320]   In the gospel, things happen which not only men would not have thought of, but which are,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.780]   as I say, the exact opposite of what men would ever have imagined God to do.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.780]   This is what he has done.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.020]   He that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.720]   He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.040]   their hearts.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.280]   He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   That is the great characteristic of the gospel.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.480]   Thank God for it.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.440]   But the righteous, sinners Jesus came to save, they that are whole, he says, have no need
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.240]   of a physician, but they that are sick.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.120]   I came not to call the righteous, the wealthy in this respect, but sinners to repentance.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.280]   Oh, thank God that the gospel in a sense starts with these words, "Blessed are the poor in
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.560]   spirit.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.320]   Blessed are they that mourn.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.920]   Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.920]   Blessed are the meek."
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.120]   Well, Mary has anticipated all that, you see.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120]   There is a synopsis of the Sermon on the Mount, in a sense, especially the Beatitudes, in
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   this magnificat.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.600]   Well, we have been looking at those aspects of her great statement, and it is indeed,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.360]   as you see, thus full, pregnant with a statement of the great central features of this gospel
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360]   of redemption.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.480]   But we come back to this further consideration this morning, and especially in these two
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.200]   verses, because here we are reminded of an element in connection with what happened when
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.100]   the Son of God came into this world, which is in many ways, I think, one of the most
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.080]   comforting aspects of our faith, and of the whole of the biblical teaching.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.840]   And that aspect is, of course, simply this.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.920]   The Incarnation is the supreme example of fulfilled prophecy.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.800]   Or if you prefer it in a more experimental phrase, it is the supreme example of God's
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.080]   faithfulness to his promises.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   Now I say that this surely is the most comforting aspect of our faith, and especially as we
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   look at it and consider it in the setting in the world in which we find ourselves at
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.460]   this present hour.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.200]   We all agree that these are no easy days for Christians.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.760]   They are exceptionally difficult days for Christians and for the whole of the Christian
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   church.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:50.000]   Contrast it with what one reads about a hundred years ago, when it was the custom for people
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.940]   to go to places of worship.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.200]   And when everybody thought in these terms what a change has taken place.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.560]   Well, it's a time of discouragement, and many Christian people are discouraged.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.040]   Therefore, what can we do better this morning, the last Sunday morning of an old year, than
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.840]   to look at the situation in which we find ourselves in the light of this message of
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.760]   the Incarnation, the message of Christmas if you like, and see what over and above the
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:28.280]   great fact itself it has to say to us in this more general manner.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.360]   And here, as I see it, there are some three principles which stand out with exceptional
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   clarity.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.960]   The first is this.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.760]   The coming of Christ into this world is the fulfillment of all God's promises.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.600]   That is what Mary is really saying.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   "He hath helped His servant Israel in remembrance of His mercy to Abraham and to his seed forever."
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.560]   Now then, the great covenant promise concerning redemption was, after all, made in its most
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.920]   explicit manner to Abraham.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.040]   It is, you can find it prior to that, there is something antecedent to that, but the definition
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.920]   of it, as it were, the explicit statement of it, is that which is made to Abraham when
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:25.560]   he is told that in him and in his seed shall all the world be blessed.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.920]   Now Mary at once, you see, sees the significance of this which is happening, this son that
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.960]   who is to be born out of her womb.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.560]   She remembers what the archangel Gabriel said about him.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.960]   She didn't understand it at that moment, but now she does.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.760]   And she begins to realize the meaning of "he shall be great and shall be called the son
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.520]   of the highest."
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.160]   She begins to understand what Elizabeth means when she says, "Blessed art thou among women,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.640]   and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.120]   And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.960]   Well now then, Mary, I say, sees all this.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.360]   Here she says now, God is going to fulfill all these promises that he has made.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:21.800]   This mercy toward Abraham and his seed forever.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   Well how is it happening?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.360]   Well it happens, she says, like this, "He hath hopened his servant Israel."
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:35.560]   And that word means to succor, to help, or perhaps better still, to lift up.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.060]   They had been cast down.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.520]   They need to be lifted up.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   They need to be saved.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.160]   They had been thrown down by an enemy.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.960]   Someone comes, rescues them, takes hold of them, succors them, lifts them up, puts them
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.800]   to stand upon their feet.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.760]   That is what is happening, she says.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.000]   When I give birth to this son, I am giving birth to the Savior.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.880]   The one prophesied, predicted, promised, he is coming.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.000]   All that was promised to Abraham, all this great mercy, here it is, literally coming
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.320]   into being and into action.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   What is she referring to?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.220]   Well of course she is referring primarily to salvation itself.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.640]   And this is where her statement is so significant.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:30.240]   God had made this promise to Abraham concerning salvation, forgiveness of sins, reconciliation
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.960]   unto himself.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.760]   And what we so often tend to forget is this, that what God said to Abraham was that this
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:50.320]   salvation was going to come, was to be brought through this descendant of his that was yet
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.600]   to be born into this world.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.880]   Now Abraham did not understand it fully, but he understood enough to rest his faith upon
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880]   it.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.840]   Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness, we are told.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.480]   In the Old Testament Paul takes it up and works it out as a great argument, as you remember
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.960]   in the fourth chapter of his epistle to the Romans, and likewise in the third chapter
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.880]   of the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:28.240]   You remember also how our Lord himself said on one occasion, "Abraham," he said, "rejoice
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.160]   to see my day."
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.760]   He saw it and was glad.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.840]   Now that is a reference to salvation.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.080]   That is a statement which means this, that Abraham was given to see in a flash, not very
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:49.840]   clearly, but he saw it, that God's great salvation, the forgiveness of sins and reconciliation,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.920]   was to be brought about ultimately by someone who should come into the world who would be
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.440]   of the seed of Abraham.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.000]   Now that's a very basic thought.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.560]   Mary is making that statement here, she sees it, that's what's happening.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:14.280]   In other words, we've got here in a way a summary of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.320]   And nothing is more important than for us to realize that the whole of the Old Testament
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.080]   is looking forward to this event.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.400]   Now the children of Israel were blessed, they were greatly blessed.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.600]   They were God's own people, they were unlike all the other peoples and nations of the world,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.040]   and God showered his blessings upon them, but let us never make the mistake of imagining
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.120]   that they had had everything.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   Oh no.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.640]   All they ultimately had was the promise.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.660]   It was enough, thank God it was enough, but they had nothing more than the promise.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:56.800]   You will find that this is frequently elaborated in the New Testament, as I say.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.560]   There is that tremendous statement of it there in the third chapter of the epistle to the
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.600]   Galatians, but of course you've got it again in a very striking manner in the epistle to
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.880]   the Hebrews.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:18.200]   At the end of that great eleventh chapter, all these, having obtained a good report through
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:28.320]   faith, received not the promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.780]   without us should not be made perfect.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.880]   They didn't receive the promise.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.600]   What they received was the promise of the promise, the certainty that the promise was
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   going to be fulfilled.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.240]   Now here is the key of course to the understanding of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.560]   Look at them as they went to their tabernacle and to their temple, taking their burnt offerings
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:59.600]   and meal offerings and sacrifices, animals being killed, blood being shed, offered, painted
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.240]   before the altar and so on.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.400]   What is it all?
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.360]   What was happening there?
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.440]   Well the answer is this.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:14.280]   That was but a covering, as it were, of their sins for the time being.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.720]   As we saw the argument developed in the tenth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, the
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer cannot cleanse the conscience
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.080]   from dead works and from sin.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.520]   No, no.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.840]   They were simply covered over.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.340]   They were but types pointing to the coming of the great anti-type.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.840]   They didn't really deal with sin.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.200]   No, but they were indications that God had got a way of dealing with sin.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.160]   And that, says Mary, is what is now happening.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.520]   Here are the mercies promised.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.640]   God had given this promise that to Abram and to his seed there would be mercy and compassion,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.160]   their sins should be forgiven and blotted out as a thick cloud, that they would be made
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.200]   the children of God and heirs of glory.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.080]   And all that they knew by way of offerings and sacrifices was not the fulfillment of
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.360]   that.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:17.960]   It was merely another way of giving the promise and of indicating in a measure the way in
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.280]   which it was going to be fulfilled.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.680]   Very well, but here, says Mary, now is the great anti-type himself.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:39.760]   Here now God is going to fulfill all this mercy that he had promised to Abram and to
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.480]   his seed forever, which of course means this.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:53.720]   I can only summarize it in a phrase this morning, that there is only one way of salvation and
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:16:00.960]   that all salvation and every aspect of it comes in this one way.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:10.600]   In Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and him crucified, made an offering for sin, a body that hath
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.880]   thou prepared me.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   What for?
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.040]   In order that he might be the Lamb of God, that he might be slain, he might be offered
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.640]   one sacrifice forever, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.160]   Now that's what she's saying.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   Here is the fulfillment of all the mercies.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.600]   There is no forgiveness apart from Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.360]   There is no true knowledge of God apart from him.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.880]   There is no blessing apart from him.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.000]   As the Apostle Paul puts it in the second epistle to the Corinthians in the first chapter,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.620]   "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, to the glory of God the Father."
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.200]   "He hath opened his servant Israel."
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.520]   Here is Israel, seed of Abraham.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:05.800]   Yes, but under the law and condemned by the law, under the condemnation of the law, not
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.360]   able to be free, held in bondage and in captivity.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.840]   Thank God, living on the promise, but nothing more.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.800]   Here is the great fulfillment.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.200]   And so you will find, as I say, that the whole of the Old Testament, prophets, psalmists,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.320]   leaders, they all have seen this, they're looking forward.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:30.000]   They know that that is the thing that is going to fulfill all the promises and bring the
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.060]   mercy into the individual experience.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:44.680]   It is all, I say, in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and what he did when
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.800]   he was in this world and what he is now continuing and applying in the glory.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.120]   That's the first thing.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.360]   But there is another aspect to this general statement.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:06.800]   "For there was also this other promise made to Abraham, that in him and his seed all the
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.680]   world should be blessed."
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.920]   Not in the sense I've just been describing, but in addition to that.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   And what is that?
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   Well, it is this.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.640]   And this is, of course, the point at which the Jews, the children of Israel of old, stumbled
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.800]   so sadly.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:32.760]   They didn't realize that God was promising to Abraham, not only that they, the literal,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:40.500]   physical seed, should be blessed, but that all the nations of the earth should be blessed
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:47.320]   through this person, not to the Jews only, but also to the Gentiles.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.840]   You see, there's the key to the understanding of the epistle to the Romans, isn't it?
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.000]   The Jews thought that this was only for them.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.680]   They stumbled at our Lord when he said that he was not come only for the lost sheep of
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.720]   the house of Israel and gave indications of something further.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.560]   They stumbled at it always.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:14.720]   But here is the promise made to Abraham, and Mary is given the insight to see it.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.640]   And she glories in this fact.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.320]   Here is one who is the savior of the world.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.480]   And of course, he knew it himself.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.960]   That's the explanation of the incident in John 12, isn't it?
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.640]   When the Greeks approached Andrew and said we would see Jesus.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.520]   And our Lord wouldn't say, "See them at the time," but he said, "When the Son of Man,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.720]   when I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me."
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.040]   He means all nations.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:49.760]   That his salvation is not confined to the Jews, but it is also to the Gentiles.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.760]   Peter stumbled at it.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.160]   He was given the vision.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.120]   You remember in connection with the visit of Cornelius.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.640]   He stumbled, but here is the message.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.320]   "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common?"
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.440]   The door is open to the Gentiles.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.400]   You and I would never have been Christians but for this.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.880]   It isn't confined to the Jews.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.480]   "Abraham and his seed."
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.720]   Well, who are Abraham's seed?
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.840]   Oh, not merely those who are of the circumcision, but of the uncircumcision also.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.720]   All who have the faith of Abraham.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.640]   Abraham is the father of all the faithful.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.320]   Abraham is the father of all who exercise faith in God through our Lord and Savior,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.480]   Jesus Christ.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   Thank God.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   If we are Christians, we are of the seed of Abraham.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.400]   That is the argument of Galatians 3.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:45.200]   Well, now Mary, I say, puts it all here as it were in a nutshell.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:52.040]   He hath opened his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy unto Abraham and to his seed
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.400]   forever.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:02.760]   And it is all entirely and exclusively in and through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   I must hurry on.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   I must leave it.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.080]   My dear friends, are we all quite happy and perfectly clear about this?
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.480]   You don't know God apart from Jesus Christ.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.920]   You are not reconciled to God apart from him.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.220]   It is in him that he is open, his servant Israel.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:25.680]   It is here he fulfills all the gracious promises made to Abraham and to his seed forever.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.800]   There is only one way to God.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.640]   It is in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.400]   He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.280]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.240]   There is only one way to enter with boldness into the holiest of all.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   What is it?
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.280]   It is, as we have been reminded in Hebrews 10.19, by the blood of Jesus.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   Mary is expressing all that.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:56.120]   However, let me hurry on to my second point, which is this one.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:05.040]   The coming of Christ shows us the method or the manner of God's blessing.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.200]   I am particularly interested in this this morning.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.360]   The coming of Christ, I have said, is the fulfillment of all God's promises.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.840]   Yes, but let us observe the way in which he does it.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:23.080]   The coming of Christ sheds this great illumination upon God's method, God's manner of fulfilling
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.000]   his own promises and bringing his mercies into being.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.960]   Now, here is the key, of course.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:37.120]   It is in the expression, "In remembrance he hath opened his servant Israel."
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:46.400]   In remembrance of his mercy to Abraham and to his seed forever, as he spake to our fathers.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.480]   Here again is a summary of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.600]   Now, let us take this phrase, "In remembrance."
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.080]   Here is the comfort and the consolation of the Scripture.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.480]   What is happening, Mary seems to say to herself, "What is happening is this.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.440]   God after all has remembered his promise.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:17.520]   In remembrance of his promise, of his mercies, of all he had said to Abraham and to the fathers
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.160]   through the running centuries."
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.280]   What she is saying in effect, therefore, is this, you see.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:31.080]   God seems to forget, doesn't he?
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   He seems to forget what he has promised.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.200]   Yes, his promise, his promised mercy to Abraham.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.760]   When did he give that promise?
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.960]   Here you see is the startling answer.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:55.080]   He had given that promise to Abraham two thousand long years before Mary was singing these words.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.360]   Two thousand years.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   That is God's method.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.760]   There he calls Abraham one night.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.240]   He says, "Come out of your tent.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.000]   Stand here and look at the stars in the heavens.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.440]   Can you count them?
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.520]   Imagine that you are looking at the sand on the seashore.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.840]   Can you count the individual granules?
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.800]   So shall thy seed be.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:24.320]   In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:34.800]   And then two thousand years elapse and the Messiah doesn't seem to come.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.480]   Has God forgotten his promise?
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.920]   Is there any value in his promises?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.200]   Well here you see is the lesson.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.600]   Here is the comfort and the consolation.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   There is nothing which is quite so foolish as to judge God in terms of our time measurements
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.600]   and our calendars.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.160]   And there are so many discouraged Christian people in churches today.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.400]   They say, "Perhaps the higher critics are right after all.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.720]   They say you know that there is no such thing as prophecy, that you can't foretell and that
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.960]   all that we've talked about the promises of God is all nonsense.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.680]   This is nothing but a bit of ethics and morality which we've got to put into practice."
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.920]   People are beginning to get discouraged.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.480]   "Is it true after all?
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.760]   Where are these promises of God?
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.000]   You who believe in them still.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.240]   Well why aren't they being fulfilled?
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.200]   Why does God allow this and that?
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.960]   Isn't that the foolish talk and argument?"
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.440]   Well nobody who has ever heard these words this morning should ever say that again.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   In remembrance.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.520]   "What's happening?" says Mary.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.120]   She answers herself and says, "What is happening now is that God is fulfilling what he promised
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.520]   two thousand years ago."
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:54.440]   Shame on us Christian people for thinking so much as worldlings and using the foolish
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.360]   methods of philosophy when we are dealing with the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   In remembrance.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   With God a thousand years are but as one day, and one day is a thousand years.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:17.320]   You'll find the psalmist crying out in his moment of almost despair and saying, "Hath
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.920]   God forgotten to be gracious?"
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.200]   Of course he hasn't.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.680]   It's he who doesn't know his scriptures, he doesn't know his God.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.200]   In remembrance.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   After two thousand years.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.720]   Yes, but let me add to that.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:41.440]   Not only had God made this promise two thousand years before, and all the years and centuries
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:48.360]   had passed and he hadn't come, there was something even more depressing than that.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:56.040]   At this time when Mary uttered these words, there had been no prophetic word to Israel
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.560]   for four hundred years.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:06.400]   The last of the prophets was Malachi, and four hundred years had gone since Malachi
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.760]   had exercised his ministry and had prophesied.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.320]   Can you imagine that?
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.480]   We who get so impatient if God doesn't answer us at once, we offer a prayer and if he doesn't
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.840]   answer the next moment, we say, "Ah, it's God's love after all."
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:26.840]   Four hundred years and his chosen people haven't had a single word.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   What is happening?
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.680]   "Oh," says Mary, "what is happening is this.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:38.520]   God is still there and God still remembers, in remembrance of his promise."
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   God I say seems to forget.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   Now there's our first principle.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.960]   We've all known something about this in personal experience, haven't we?
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.400]   Well let us learn this lesson.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   God never forgets.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.840]   He cannot forget.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.600]   He sees the end from the beginning.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.820]   He is in the eternal now.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.880]   He is from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.400]   He is not in the flux of time.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.480]   He is outside it.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.760]   He doesn't see things as we do.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.080]   He seems to forget, but he doesn't.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.760]   So the next time you're tempted to think that he does, you simply look at the fact
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.840]   of the incarnation and it's the eternal answer to your fears.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.920]   But let me hurry to a second point which seems to me to emerge here.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   It is this.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:28.680]   He not only seems to forget, but he allows apparent defeats to take place, even to his
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.400]   own people.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.840]   He called Abram out of Ur of the Chaldeas, and he made his great statement and promise
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   to him.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.200]   He creates a nation out of him, blesses this nation.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   Yes, but look on a few years and you'll find that that nation is in the captivity and the
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.280]   bondage of Egypt.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.480]   Look at the taskmasters and their whips.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.840]   See the people bleeding and groaning under the dictatorship of Pharaoh.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.880]   God allowed all of them.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.760]   They seem to be utterly forsaken, defeated, and quite forlorn and without any hope at
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   all.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.280]   Look at it again in the case of the captivity of Babylon.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.080]   Same thing, city destroyed.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.840]   The city of God reduced to a mess of rubble, ruins, all the gorgeous buildings razed to
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.400]   the ground.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.640]   The people carried out, taken away as slaves in utter helplessness in the captivity of
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.480]   Babylon.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.840]   God allowed all that.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.280]   The God who promised so much allowed all that.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.640]   He allowed many a great conqueror to come up, the Assyrians and others, and Israel was
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   discomfited and defeated.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:49.200]   And at the very time, of course, that Mary was uttering these words, the Jews and their
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.000]   land had been conquered and had been possessed by the great Roman Empire.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.460]   And there they were again as vassals once more.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:03.360]   In the captivity, as it were, of Rome, helpless and hopeless, what could they do?
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.960]   God had allowed all this.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.240]   That's a part of his method.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.680]   It comes out so clearly, doesn't it?
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.800]   He allows apparent defeats.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.360]   But there is another principle, and thank God for this, and here it is.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.180]   He gives, in spite of all this, periodic encouragements.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:34.380]   The initial promise to Abraham, then apparent forgetfulness, then forgetfulness apparently
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.240]   to the point at which he has even forsaken his people and is no longer interested or
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.780]   else has not the power to help them and to deliver them.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:47.120]   Ah, yes, but to save us from a final despair and utter hopelessness, he gives periodic
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   encouragements.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.040]   "He hath opened his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy to Abraham and to his seed forever,"
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.360]   in brackets, "as he spake to our fathers."
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   You go through your Old Testament and you'll find that God, in different ways, repeats
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.240]   the promise made to Abraham.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.120]   He repeated it to Isaac, he repeated it to Jacob, he repeated it to Judah, he repeated
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.200]   it to David, he's got it here in some of the Psalms, it's here in some of the prophets.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.560]   Just at any given moment, God may send the message.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.400]   The people are almost giving up and giving in, and God sends the word, reminding them
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.400]   of the promise.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.760]   He says, "I am still the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   The covenant God, the covenant-keeping God, the promise is still in force, it still avails,
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:44.280]   as he promised to our fathers, as he spake to our fathers.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.300]   And you know, if I didn't believe this, I'd confess from this pulpit to be altogether
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.280]   without hope this morning.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.700]   If I, like some people, believed that the success and the future of the Christian church
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.920]   was dependent upon human ability and power and organization, if I believed that organized
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.840]   campaigns and so on were really going to solve the problem, I confess that I would be entirely
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.640]   without hope this morning.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   Things are very bad, you say.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.320]   What's the use of going on praying for revival?
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.160]   The answer is the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.760]   This is the God in whom I believe, the God who makes a promise and then seems to forget
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.560]   it, allows his people to be thrown down, to be defeated, almost destroyed.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.200]   There they are, languishing in hopelessness.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.680]   Thank God he gives us bits of encouragement.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.880]   He reminds us that he's still there.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.400]   We are praying for showers.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.920]   Thank God for an occasional droplet.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.480]   Thank God for an occasional warming of the heart.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.200]   Oh, it's nothing I know.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.320]   Yes, but don't despise the day of small things.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:56.120]   The God who does the small thing is just giving you a sample of the big thing he can do.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.320]   As he spake to our fathers, and he still does it, we are passing through a period of difficulty.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   We are in a wilderness.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   We are in a drought.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.440]   Thank God for every little encouragement he gives.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.080]   He reminds us that he's the God of our fathers still.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.880]   The promise is sure.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.840]   That's his method.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.360]   And then my last comment under this heading is this, that he obviously has his own chosen
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.760]   time.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.440]   Who would have anticipated that he would have sent his son into the world at the particular
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.640]   moment he did?
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.440]   But it was then God did it.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.880]   Why, well, it was the fullness of the times.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.760]   Don't try to understand God's ways.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.600]   Get hold of these principles, but if you think you'll be able to work out a plan and a scheme
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.000]   and say that in such and such a month, such and such a things to happen, you'll be wrong
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   every time.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.880]   You can't do it.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.200]   God has got his own time.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.920]   He's got his own method.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.160]   He's got his own appointed due moment.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.720]   And when it comes, he does what he said he'd do.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.920]   He didn't give a time to Abram.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:09.520]   All he told him was that he would send this Messiah out of his lines, and he did it.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.240]   And he did it in his own moment.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.080]   You know, that's to me the marvellous thing about revival, which we've been speaking
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.720]   and talking about so much this year.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.160]   You can never prophesy them.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   You can never predict.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.520]   There's always an element of surprise.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.280]   Just when you think all is hopeless and you're giving up, God comes.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.120]   And he doesn't come when you think he's going to.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.600]   I've said it before from this pulpit, I say it again.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.220]   You know, that's what makes preaching such a romantic thing.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.640]   This is the most romantic place in the world that I know of at any rate.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.600]   I never know what's going to happen when I enter into this pulpit.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.040]   I sometimes think something wonderful is going to happen, and it doesn't happen.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.920]   I sometimes come with comparative dryness, and God gives me this blessing, this shower
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.920]   in my soul.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.800]   He's got his own time.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.000]   Well, let's learn the principles.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Let's go on.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.720]   Let's be content knowing that God has his plan, his covenant, his purpose, and he'll
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.160]   surely bring it to pass.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.520]   But let me say just a word on my last principle, which is this.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:17.560]   The coming of Christ is the guarantee of the fulfilment of all God's promises to all the
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.560]   seed.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.600]   We are now looking to the future.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:30.120]   This event guarantees not only all that we've been looking at, but the whole of the future,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.000]   for God's promises are not exhausted yet.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.960]   There is much more to come.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:44.280]   What Mary saw was this, you see, that the birth of this son of hers was an absolute
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:53.480]   proof of God's faithfulness to his promises, that not one of them can ever fall or fail,
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:59.840]   not any one of them can ever fail to be fulfilled.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:09.680]   For his mercy is ever faithful, ever sure.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:15.800]   Here's the way to look at the future then.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:23.080]   What God did when he sent his son into the world is an absolute guarantee that he will
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.600]   do everything that he's ever promised to do.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.520]   Look at it in a personal sense.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:38.160]   All things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   That's a promise.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:45.240]   To them who are called according to his purpose.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.320]   But how can I know that that's true for me, says someone?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.800]   The answer is the incarnation.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.160]   God has given the final proof there that all his promises are sure, that he is faithful
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.320]   to everything he's ever said.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.240]   So that promise is sure for you.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:08.280]   Whatsoever your state or condition may be, whatever may come to meet you, he has said,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.620]   "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.620]   And he won't.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.720]   He said so.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.800]   And we've got an absolute proof that he fulfills his promises.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   He doesn't always do it immediately in the way that we think.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.760]   No, no, but he does it.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.840]   And he'll never fail to do it.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.880]   Well obviously, we've got a theme here that will keep us for the rest of the day and the
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   rest of the week.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.800]   Work it out for yourselves.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.760]   Look at it in terms of your sanctification.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.160]   Are you struggling against sin?
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.680]   Are you sometimes feeling hopeless?
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.280]   Here's the answer to you.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:48.360]   He which hath begun a good work in us will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.000]   He is bringing many sons into glory.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.080]   And you know, my friend, if you're a child of God, if he set his heart upon you, if you're
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:00.680]   in his plan, if you're one of his chosen, he will deal with you until you shall be finally
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.060]   faultless and blameless without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.320]   He will perfect you.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.360]   If you are fool enough to defy him, he'll chastise you.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.280]   He'll whip you with scorpions.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.640]   He'll chisel you until he gets you where he's purposed to bring you.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.160]   Then fight against him therefore, whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.520]   And he's doing it for our holiness, for our sanctification.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   His promise is sure.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.080]   It will never fail.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.880]   There's no such thing as falling away from grace.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.400]   If a man has been given new life, it will go on to final perfection.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.800]   He hath sanctified forever them that come unto God by him, them whom he hath chosen.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.560]   Of course.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.520]   This is God and he doesn't change.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.720]   His purposes cannot be frustrated.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:56.200]   Your sanctification is guaranteed by the incarnation and ultimately our glorification.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.000]   Isn't it difficult to realize this?
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.360]   But you know the promise to Abram and his seed is this.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.640]   Not merely that our sins are to be forgiven and that we are to be reconciled to God, no,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.760]   but that we are to be saved entirely, completely.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.360]   Body, soul and spirit, perfect.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.080]   Without any blemish I say of any kind.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.040]   And of course it's how difficult it is for us to realize this.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.600]   Your body is weak and frail, so is mine.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.860]   Aches and pains, the old tent is beginning to dissolve.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:37.800]   But my dear friend, if you are a child of God, your body is going to be glorified.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:44.120]   We look for the Savior who shall change this, our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.800]   unto his glorious body.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:54.920]   According to that power whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.680]   What a glorious promise.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.760]   It's all there underwritten, says Mary, in this event, in this incarnation.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.600]   His promises, he's remembered them.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.760]   He's going to fulfill them all because he is who and what he is.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:13.040]   Look at it then in general.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.920]   Because you know you and I are just in a state of transition now, so is the whole church.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.880]   What is this age in which we are living?
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.600]   Well it is the age of the gathering out of God's people from all nations under the sun.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.520]   Sometimes they come one by one, sometimes in crowds, in revivals they may come by the
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.520]   thousands.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.360]   Yes, it's been going on for these two thousand years nearly.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   What is it?
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.880]   It's the gathering out of the church, God perfecting the church.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.600]   And he's going on with it until all the fullness of the Jews and the Gentiles shall have come
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.840]   in and the church will be perfect.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   What then?
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.960]   Well then the promise is that Christ will come again.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   What for?
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:01.400]   Well, to receive these his people and to destroy all his foes.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.240]   Are you worried about the church?
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.400]   Are you worried about all these rationalists and clever people?
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.880]   Are you beginning to fear that they are going to undermine the Christian faith and that
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.120]   everything is going to be lost?
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.080]   My dear friend, if you do, you haven't understood the meaning of the incarnation.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.640]   Think of the two thousand years that elapsed since the promise to Abram.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.940]   Look at the defeats to which the children of Israel were subjected.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.940]   Look at the utter hopelessness.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.720]   It is still the same God.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.480]   The church is in eclipse at the moment, but what's it matter?
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.080]   It's God's.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   And the church is going to be brought to the place which God has purposed for her.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:42.320]   Christ will come again and He'll come probably as He did the first time when we'll all feel
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.200]   utterly hopeless and filled with despair and say the church is finished and nothing can
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   be done.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.400]   He'll come and He'll scatter His enemies.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:55.240]   The proud He will put down and the mighty He will hurl down from their seats and fill
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.200]   the hungry with good things and the rich He will send empty away.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:07.840]   He will come to judge the world in righteousness and evil and sin and hell and Satan and everything
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.320]   shall be cast into the lake of fire and of burning for all eternity.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:19.840]   And He will usher in His glorious kingdom, His eternal kingdom of glory and of might
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.120]   and of power.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:27.960]   He will be over all and He will then finally hand the kingdom back to the Father.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.280]   And you and I, you Christian people, will be in that kingdom and in that glory.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:39.960]   We shall judge the world, we shall judge angels, we shall share in the glory and the triumph
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.200]   of the Son of God.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.920]   God's promised this.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:50.240]   It's a part of the promise to Abram.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.400]   And God's method patently is still the same as it was through the days of the Old Testament
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.160]   dispensation.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.880]   He appears to forget and the world ridicules.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:05.800]   They say, "Where is the promise of His coming?"
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:13.760]   And the answer which we still give is this, that God is God, that He is not like men,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:20.680]   that within a thousand days there is one year and one year and one day is a thousand years.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.920]   He has His time.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.120]   He has His method.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:30.560]   In His wisdom He allows many things to happen to His people for their own perfection, for
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:38.680]   teaching them for their discipline and for His own final glory.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:45.040]   And as He sent His Son out of the womb of Mary when the fullness of the times had come,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:52.480]   He will send Him again out of heaven riding the clouds accompanied by the holy angels.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:44:04.360]   Jesus shall reign wherever the sun doth His successive journeys run, His kingdom stretch
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:13.560]   from shore to shore till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:27.200]   In remembrance of His mercy to Abram and to his seed forever as He spake to our fathers.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:35.360]   Thank God the incarnation is the final proof of the faithfulness of God, the guarantee
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:43.600]   that His every promise will be fully fulfilled.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.160]   Amen.
