[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.800]   [ding]
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.700]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.400]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800]   Today, my guest is Manher Patel.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.600]   Manher heard me talk on the show about how I admire immigrants in the United States,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400]   and I always am interested in their stories.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500]   He said, "Well, I'm an immigrant, and I've got an interesting story."
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200]   So, after a little back and forth, I invited him on the show.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.600]   So, Manher, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   Thank you, Joshua, for inviting me.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.700]   I've been interested in this, and I think you are originally from India, right?
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.200]   Is that correct?
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.500]   Yes. Yes, correct.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.900]   I'm interested in this because the person that I heard that statistic I've cited on the show before
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.600]   was from where I've said that an immigrant to the United States is four times more likely
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.800]   to become a millionaire than a natural-born citizen.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.600]   And by the way, I have not independently verified that recently,
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.900]   so that could be slightly mistaken.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.600]   But who I heard that from was an associate of Zig Ziglar years ago,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.100]   and he used to do this work with Zig, and he was an immigrant from India.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.800]   I forget his name.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.600]   I think I want to say it was Krish something like that, something.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.100]   But he had arrived from India with $9 in his pocket,
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.900]   and he told the story of how he had arrived from India with $9 in his pocket
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.300]   and gone from there and had done very well.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.900]   And I'd love to see a review of even the Indian culture,
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.700]   and I'd love to see some of the statistics broken out,
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.500]   because the Indian culture seems to be, you guys seem to be incredibly productive at building wealth.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000]   So, welcome to the show.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.800]   I'm going to pump you with questions today and learn all of your secrets as an Indian immigrant.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   So, let's start with a little bit of your story.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.900]   Walk us through how you wound up in the United States.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.700]   So, share with us.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.300]   Sure.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.900]   So, I was born and raised in India, and, you know, I finished my schooling in India,
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.800]   and after I completed my 12th grade in India, I was jokingly, you know, telling my dad,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.200]   you know, I should go outside of India to study something, and I want to study medicine.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.800]   So, it was very difficult to get admission in India,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.200]   and the cheapest option was to go to Poland or Russia.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.900]   So, I'm like, oh, Russia sounds good to me.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.800]   So, I went there, new country.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.000]   I didn't know language or anything.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.700]   I, you know, I went there in 2005, and then I stayed there for six years in Russia
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.500]   and completed my med school in 2011.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.600]   So, after finishing my med school, there were a lot of challenges back in Russia
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.500]   to cook our own food as I'm vegetarian, and also, you know, to speak Russian
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.600]   because you have to learn Russian there because you are living in Russia.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.100]   So, that was another thing which was very crazy back in Russia.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.500]   And then, after I finished my med school, I decided that I want to move to US
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   because of better life and opportunities here in US.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.100]   So, I started preparing for my board exam for US.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.700]   So, after I gave my first board exam, I came to US.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.800]   I had a visitor visa back from Russia where I got 10-year visitor visa.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.900]   So, I came back to US to give my first exam I gave in India,
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.600]   then second exam I came to US to give because that's the exam you can only give in US.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.700]   So, during that time, I was also looking for, you know, to find a spouse in US
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.100]   because I want to move to US.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.400]   So, fortunately, I was able to find my wife whom I dated like for six months back in time,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.300]   and then we decided to get married, and then eventually we got married in India in December 2012.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.800]   How did you meet her?
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.000]   I met through matrimonial website. It's called shadi.com.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.400]   It's specifically for Indian people.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   Okay. How do you spell shadi.com?
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.000]   Shadi. S-H-A-D-I. It's like match.com.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.200]   What does it mean? Is that in Hindi? What does it mean?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.500]   Yeah. Shadi means wedding in our language.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.700]   Okay. Awesome.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   That's a great way to meet.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.000]   It sounds like a perfect way to meet an Indian girl in the United States.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.900]   So, keep going. I was just curious.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.300]   Yeah. So, after that, you know, everything started, my immigration process and everything.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.300]   So, after my wedding, I moved to US, and I completed my immigration process in US instead of in India
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.500]   because when somebody applies from US, it takes like one year to come to US,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.300]   but I already had a visitor visa.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.500]   So, I just came to US, and then my wife applied here, everything,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.200]   and it was a very smooth process here. In six months, I got my green card,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.300]   and by that time, it was time to apply for my residency,
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.500]   and it's not like applying like a general job.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   You know, you have to pay money for each hospital. It costs $25 after nine hospitals you apply.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.300]   So, I applied like 400 hospitals, which cost me more than $7,000 just to apply for my residency,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.900]   and I wasn't working, and my wife barely started working.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.100]   So, and it was a huge disappointment because I didn't get any interviews for my residency,
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.900]   and I was like, "What am I going to do?"
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.000]   Then I started doing this externship at a physician office,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and also, I started doing research at University of Illinois in psychiatry
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   because that was something which interests me,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and I was doing this free work for more than one and a half year,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.500]   and still no way to get residency.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   So, again, I applied for residency next year, which was 2014.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.100]   Now, again, I did the same thing. I wasted more than $7,000 to $8,000, but no luck,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.900]   and I was tired of working free for physician or the university,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.300]   so I decided to get a job, and nobody would give a job.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.500]   There was funny thing. Whenever I apply even for pharmacy technician job,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.600]   they say, "You're overqualified."
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.200]   So, I'm like...
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.700]   - How were you supporting yourself during this time?
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.900]   - No, my wife was supporting me. She was working. She's nurse.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.200]   So, she was making pretty decent, and we used to live in like two-bedroom condo in Chicago,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.300]   and in Chicago, you know, it's $1,000 for two-bedroom condo,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.600]   so it's not bad as California where I live, where I pay two times more than that.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.800]   - Keep going.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.000]   - Yeah, so I found a job on internet, and I moved to California, and then my job.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.100]   So, what happened was we left my wife's job for $30 there, what she was making there,
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.700]   and we came here for $19 job here.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.600]   So, we moved for $19 job from Chicago to California, and our moving expense was $3,000 to $4,000 or whatever.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.800]   I said, you know, "Let's move for better future."
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.500]   And then to transfer my wife's license from state of Illinois to state of California,
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.900]   it took them four months. I cannot believe that.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.200]   My wife went to US school. She has already license in state of Illinois.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.600]   Just to transfer the license, it took four months. She was just sitting home for four months.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.100]   Yeah. So, there was crazy part in California, and then eventually she got her license,
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.800]   and then she started working too.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.700]   So, then what happened in my work, like there was mostly all our doctors,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.600]   but we didn't, you know, went to residency because all were looking for some other job opportunities.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.900]   So, we had this specific exam for coding, which I do right now, coding and documentation review for the hospitals.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.400]   So, as soon as you pass the exam, they raise you.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.500]   So, my money went from $19 to $30 in less than six months. My salary went up that much.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   So, hold on just one moment to make sure that I understand.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.900]   So, you couldn't gain access to a residency.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:51.900]   So, you took the exam to be a medical coder, and then you were working on that on the side. Is that accurate?
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.400]   Yes, yes. That's accurate.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.200]   And so, is this a work from home thing? I don't know much about medical coding.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.000]   I've heard people talk about how it can be a great work from home opportunity.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.600]   Tell me what is medical coding, and how does that work?
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.900]   So, medical coding is basically, you know, whenever you go to a physician, right, they treat you, right?
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.600]   For example, they treat you for hypertension or any disease,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.000]   but you are paid based on what hospital submits to Medicare.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.900]   So, for hypertension, there is a specific code, for example, 410 or 420, whatever.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.300]   So, the hospital has to submit that code to Medicare or any insurance company to get the reimbursement.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.100]   So, if they don't submit their codes, they don't get the money.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.400]   So, what we do is we generate those codes based on the, you know, documentation of the physician.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.600]   So, we generate like, in each coding sheet, we have like 20 to 50 codes, depending on what patient have.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   And based on that, we get reimbursed, hospital get reimbursed for those things.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:52.100]   So, this allowed you to earn some income while you were still looking for a job as a physician to be able to support yourself.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.700]   Yes.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.800]   Great. All right, keep going.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:01.500]   Yeah, so after that, you know, and my old work was like, you know, I wasn't enjoying there much after one and a half year of work.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.400]   So, I decided to find another job.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.000]   And eventually, I land in LA in one of the universities here with the same job.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.300]   But of course, like the pay was two times more than my initial pay.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.700]   So, I'm like, okay, I'm going to get this job, definitely.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.900]   And so far, I joined the job this year, February, and it's going so far pretty good here.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.400]   I like the university because of the benefits.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.300]   And, you know, before I was in corporate setting, but right now I'm in hospital setting.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.900]   So, it's much more enjoyable in hospital settings.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.600]   And so, you're working as a physician now?
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.800]   No, no, no. I'm not working yet, but I'm working as a document specialist for the hospital.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.400]   So, basically, what we do is we review the hospital charts, and we try to improve the documentation there.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.800]   Got it. Excuse me, I misunderstood.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:53.400]   Are you still on the path to be able to use your medical education and licensing?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.000]   I don't have a license yet, but yeah, I'm definitely able to use my medical background
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.800]   because what we do is we review and we try to query physicians regarding the specificity of the diagnosis.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.600]   When we query them, the end result is reimbursement increases in that for the hospital.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.300]   So, yeah, it's really beneficial for the hospitals to hire us.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.400]   Why do you think you haven't been able to get a job as a physician?
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.100]   Sorry, you were cutting off there, Joshua.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.600]   No problem. Why do you think you haven't been able to get a job as a physician?
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.800]   See, it's highly competitive, and I will give you the statistic.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.500]   Like last year, there were 26,000 open spots, right?
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   And you can only apply once a year, which is in September, and you know next year in March.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.800]   And there were 26,000 open spots, and there were more than 50,000 applicants.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.400]   And of course, the first preference is U.S. graduates.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.600]   So who went to school to U.S. medical school, they are the first preference.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   And then there are the FMGs, which who went to Caribbean for two years and two years in U.S.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.500]   And third are us, who are international medical graduates.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.900]   So definitely, you know, I am on the third number there.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.200]   So that's why I think it's difficult for me to get in.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.000]   Got it. Got it.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.300]   So tell me about the finances of this way,
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.900]   because it sounds like a lot of knocking on doors that haven't opened.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.400]   I mean, you were spent, based upon the numbers you were telling me,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.600]   you're spending, you know, several thousand dollars, five or seven thousand dollars,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.700]   trying to make all these applications.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.900]   Did you have money when you moved here to the U.S.?
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.800]   I definitely didn't have money when I moved, but you know, my wife was supporting me because she started working, right?
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.000]   So she was supporting me in that way, and we were able to save that money
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.500]   because we know that every year in September, I have to apply for my residency.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.700]   So for example, this year I have to apply, but of course I won't be applying that many hospitals.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.800]   So I just need like two thousand dollars for this year, which I already saved up for my this year residency application.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.700]   And over the last few years, have you been able to build savings,
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:57.800]   even though you are still struggling to get into the position that you want to be in?
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:14.000]   [phone ringing]
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.800]   Are you back?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.700]   Yes, I'm just back.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:23.200]   Great. So over the last few years, have you been able to save money
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   while you've also been working towards your medical...
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.800]   Yes, can you hear me?
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   Can you hear me now?
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Your voice is cutting off.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   Okay, let me just wait a moment here. Hold on a second.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.500]   Alright, can you hear me now?
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.200]   Yes.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Alright, let's try again.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.000]   Over the last few years, have you been able to save money
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   while you have been trying to get into a medical physician position?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.500]   Or have you just basically been treading water?
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.600]   So here is the funny thing.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.500]   I wasn't able to save anything until I moved to California in 2014.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.300]   And not in 2014 even I didn't save anything.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.000]   But in 2015, when I applied for my residency again,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.100]   you know, I started reading about finance a lot, a lot.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.400]   Like all the finance blog and, you know, listening to podcasts.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   So I was thinking like I should learn about tech stuff because it seems interesting and complex.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.700]   And what I'm supposed to do after I come home from job? I work for eight hours a day.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.700]   I have three weekends and I'm free after I come from home.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.900]   I just go to gym for one hour, cook my food, and still I have three, four hours left in my day.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.100]   So, okay, let me read like this finance thing.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.900]   So once I started reading, I learned about 401k.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.500]   So I started maxing out my 401k. I started in September 2015.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:52.300]   So my goal is to put $692.32 each pay period for me and my spouse.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   So it comes around $3,000 a month.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:01.600]   I mean, so $36,000 a year and if you divide by 26, sorry, 12 months, it should be $3,000 a month.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.000]   So that's my goal for now.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.100]   Congratulations, man. That's awesome. That'd be a great step.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.900]   And you're working now towards early financial independence. Is that right?
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.100]   Yes, my goal is that.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.100]   And when do you hope to be financially independent?
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.600]   So here is the thing. In five years, I want to at least, you know,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.800]   accumulate like $500,000 so that if I wish I cannot work, my wife's job is clinical.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.400]   So of course she loves her job and she wants to keep working.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.500]   So that's fine. So right now my goal is to save anywhere between $5,000 to $6,000 a month,
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:39.300]   which I'm close to $4,000 a month, but which will only get me $348,000 in five years
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.000]   if I say compounding is 7% and I right now have $52,000 invested.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.100]   So if I increase that to $6,000 a month with my principle of $52,000 based on 7% compounding,
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.400]   in five years I will be able to get $586,000 approximately.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.900]   So I hope to, you know, increase my savings to $6,000 a month
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.500]   so I can get around, yeah, my magical number in five years.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.700]   How long now have you been in the United States?
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.600]   Three and a half years.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.900]   And you've been able to, you don't have any debt,
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:16.400]   you've been able to save $50,000 and you're now working hard towards five years
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.500]   with the goal of having half a million dollars.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.400]   How much are your monthly living expenses?
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.600]   My expenses are actually pretty high because I live in California in SoCal
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.200]   and just my rent is $2,100.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.300]   So my bare expenses are $3,500 a month.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.600]   That's great.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.900]   Do you think that people from India are more productive at becoming wealthy in the United States
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:52.100]   than either natural-born US citizens or from other ethnic groups?
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.500]   I think so because the thing is the people who come from India to US,
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.300]   they already have their mindset that they have to work hard to make money in US
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.700]   and they work like long hours.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.900]   Like, you know, I have a couple of friends who have business right now
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.600]   and they did a minimum wage job for seven to eight years,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.100]   but they did like two or three jobs and saved up money and bought the business in cash.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.800]   So I know people like that too who did like crazy work
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   and got business in US in seven to eight years by working two, three jobs.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.500]   So people who come from India are very like,
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.200]   they are like, their mind is already set that they have to work hard
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.600]   because they are going to new country and they have to make money.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.400]   So, yeah.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.800]   It's been my experience and I can't prove this with data.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.300]   It's just been my observations that people from India with the Indian culture
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:44.800]   tend to be drawn towards starting or running a business of some kind.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.700]   I haven't found that many of them have wanted to participate in things like the 401k system,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.400]   investing in large publicly traded companies.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   Do you think that's true?
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.700]   Yes, that's definitely true because I haven't met any Indian so far in my family
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.900]   or anywhere who believes in 401k and who has even a little bit knowledge about 401k.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.800]   They just believe to have savings as a cash money and then buy some business down the line.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.300]   That's what majority of people, Indian, believes.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.900]   Why do you think that is?
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.200]   Because, I don't know, because it's like sometimes their family has the business
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.800]   or their friends' business, so they want to copy or replicate them.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   But they're like, "Okay, let me save this much money."
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.400]   Like, for example, "Okay, let me save $250,000 to buy like $1 million model or something,
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   which will be 20% down payment.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.900]   And based on that, I can buy a hotel or any business like Subway or Papa John's."
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.700]   They just want to keep saving and saving.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.900]   And once they have enough money, they will jump into business.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.200]   The stereotype, and I don't know if it's true or not, but the stereotype is that there are
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:53.100]   a few different types of businesses that seem to be dominated by people from India,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.600]   Indian immigrants.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.700]   A few of them would be like the 7-Elevens.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:03.200]   And for me, locally, most of my Dunkin' Donuts seem to be run by Indian families.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   Also hotels, like you mentioned.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   Do you think, first, do you think the stereotypes are accurate?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.100]   Are these industries dominated by Indians?
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.200]   Or do you think it's inaccurate?
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.000]   No, definitely true.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.200]   Dunkin' Donuts and hotel business are mainly dominated by Indians.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.800]   And because I used to live in Chicago before, so I know like majority of Dunkin' in Chicago
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.500]   are owned by Indians, majority of them.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.500]   Why do you think that is?
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.000]   What is it about the Indian culture where Indian immigrants to the U.S. are drawn to
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.500]   businesses like Dunkin' Donuts or like running and buying and running hotels?
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.900]   Yeah, because they think one thing, okay, most of them when they came to U.S. like 20,
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.100]   30 years back, they weren't that educated.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.400]   So they are thinking, you know, let me work like very hard for now, five to six years,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.100]   you know, save some money and buy business.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.100]   And once they got one business, they see how much money they can make.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.700]   So they keep buying more and more.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.400]   Like I know, I know one person who has like more than five subway with him because he
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   came from India.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   He's as old as me.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.600]   He's 28 year old, but he has five subway because he came to U.S.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.100]   He's like, I'm not going to study or do anything, you know.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.200]   So he saved up for a couple of years, got a subway.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.100]   And once you have one business, whenever there is another business nearby there who want
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.800]   to sell, like for example, Dunkin', they will offer to the Dunkin' guy or the person who
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.000]   owns the business nearby because it's easier for them to control in that way.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.500]   Tell me about, are there any Indian customs surrounding money?
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.400]   For example, I'm thinking of things like lending within the Indian community or things like
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   that.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.500]   Are there any Indian customs surrounding money that you think would be useful or helpful
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.800]   to the audience of Radical Personal Finance to think about?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.600]   Indian do lend the money to each other based on the, you know, so based on the families
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   they know each other.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.800]   Like, for example, if somebody knows for somebody knows them for a long time, they will give
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   cash money to them.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.200]   OK, you need money to take $10,000, for example, but you have to repay me in one year.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   But I don't like the system at all because I'm I don't like the system.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.100]   But yeah, there is this system which is integral to Indian community in U.S. or anywhere where
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.300]   there are Indians.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.300]   Why don't you like the system?
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.140]   Because I had some bad experience like lending some money back in days in my school to my
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.140]   friend.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.420]   It's very hassle, you know, and they don't repay you on their time and you've got to
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.180]   keep them asking and asking.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.700]   So from that point, I decided, you know, I won't jump in this kind of things.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.800]   Is there so the reason I'm interested in these in this topic is because a lot of times when
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.820]   you get into an ethnic subgroup, there are different systems of accountability.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.500]   So as I've observed in some systems in the United States, your credit score in working
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.840]   through the credit reporting agencies is the primary way of establishing somebody's trustworthiness
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   as a borrower.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.300]   But when you get into an ethnic subgroup where you're getting a loan from somebody to someone
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.500]   else, there's not you don't have that same system.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.440]   You know, your relative or your friend is not reporting you to the credit reporting
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.000]   agencies as being delinquent on your debt.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.940]   So what are the mechanisms in when borrowing and when lending money?
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.220]   What are the mechanisms for accountability to make sure that you're being paid back?
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.480]   So basically, for example, if I want to like if you're if you if you ask money for from
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.060]   me and I don't need that well, so you have to find some person who knows me very well
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.100]   and that person can vouch for you.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.980]   That's the only way they get the money.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.820]   And then if you don't repay, then there's the public shaming, basically, your reputation
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.860]   within your community group is damaged.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.780]   Is that yes, is that accurate?
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   Yes, accurate.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.780]   OK.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.100]   What are the lessons would you like to share with my audience from looking at the United
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:54.320]   States and looking at your experience within the context of being an immigrant going on
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.980]   almost four years now?
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.500]   What are the lessons would you like to share with my audience to help them win with money?
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.540]   So number one is like, don't be scared to move because I moved to Chicago two times
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.980]   and I moved to California two times because of better job opportunity.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.520]   And probably by next year, I'm going to again move out of California because it's ridiculous
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.160]   expensive to live here.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.260]   So number one is don't be afraid to move and take a new opportunity or job because it always
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.220]   gives at least if it doesn't increase your money, it will increase your skills and reach
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.500]   down the line can build money for you and you will know a lot of people.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.700]   That's the number one.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.340]   Number two is like study something about finance.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.300]   It's very easy to put money in 401k if you're if you're eligible and traditional IRA, of
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.000]   course, and then Roth IRA or whatever, or just finances.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.740]   Study online, there is a lot of free material, you know, to get started with.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]   And that's what I did.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.980]   And I'm very happy this year.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.220]   I start I mean, I started last year, September, but in this year, I already had 18,000 in
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.220]   my 401k.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.380]   It's growing by 12% actually, to tell you the truth.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.180]   So I'm like, pretty happy about that.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.380]   You know, I never imagined that I would be able to save this much money and have this
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.500]   much growth in a short time.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.820]   So of course, you know, read online, ask family and friends if you don't understand anything.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.700]   And you know, sometimes things seem that it won't work out, won't work out, but it eventually
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.300]   works out in long term.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:13.420]   So for example, me, I'm still trying from a physician, this will be my fourth year trying
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.820]   and if I don't match this year, again, I'm going to try and actually I'm not going to
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.820]   quit.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.500]   I'm going to keep trying and trying because that is what I want eventually down the line.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.060]   So that's what I can tell from my experience.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.580]   Have you ever regretted moving from Russia to the United States?
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.580]   No.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.180]   Just because it's easier to be a vegetarian in the United States than Russia or for other
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.180]   reasons?
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.180]   No, other reasons.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.740]   I do have family and friends here, so it's pretty much convenient for me.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.340]   And my dad who lives in India, he also wanted that I would settle in the US.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.580]   That's what he wanted for me.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   So yeah.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.400]   Final question.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.240]   Do you interact with your financially?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.300]   Do you interact financially with your family living still in India?
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.540]   Yeah, I interact with them, but they of course, they don't know about 401k and you know, IRA
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.540]   and stuff.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.100]   That's not part of our conversation.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:12.260]   But yeah, I interact with them in a way they understand me, you know, like my parents understand
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   me.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.260]   Hey, I'm saving this much.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.260]   I'm hoping to save much.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.580]   And just general numbers, but nothing very detailed because they don't have knowledge
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.140]   about finance in the US.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.440]   But let me be more clear.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.180]   What I meant by interact was, are you sending them money?
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.500]   Are they supporting you?
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   Have you supported them?
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   Oh no.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   Do you intend to bring them to the United States?
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.540]   How is your financial relationship between your family at home versus here?
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.540]   Okay.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.940]   So normally, yeah, I don't ask money from my parents, but they, when they were, when,
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.860]   whenever they need, they ask from me and of course I send them.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.060]   So whenever they need like, but it's not a big amount.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.420]   It's like two to $3,000 at a time, once a year probably.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.040]   So whenever they ask me that they want to build something there, you know, or do something
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.780]   in our farm, you know, build a fence or something, then I send them money.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.140]   So it's not a big deal.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.980]   But yeah, in our culture and community, when parents ask you, you cannot deny them.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.300]   That's the, that's the whole thing in our community, Indian culture.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.860]   You cannot deny to your parents.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.420]   Do you think that, uh, will you ever try to bring them to the United States or will they
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.420]   stay in India?
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.420]   No, no, definitely.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.860]   Once I become a US citizen, which will be next year after I become a US citizen, I will
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.660]   definitely, you know, apply for them and they can come to us in, I think six, six, it takes
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:27.140]   six to 10 months for them to come from India to here, whole immigration process.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.060]   It's it's, uh, it's so interesting.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.600]   Almost every, uh, US immigrant for whom I've done financial planning has those line items
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.500]   on their budget that US Americans don't generally think about and it's support for family back
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.500]   home.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   And I really admire that.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.260]   Uh, I really admire the, the support of parents, the support of extended family.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.100]   I really admire, um, that immigrant mentality.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.660]   I find it so lacking on the US American culture.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.540]   But it also comes with a whole different range of considerations that you have to consider
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.500]   for financial planning of thinking about how do I prioritize my goals and how do I also
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.460]   care for my family and what are my responsibilities, uh, responsibilities there.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.780]   Uh, do you think that, um, do you think that you'll be able to pass along some of your
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.060]   values to your children or are you worried about them looking just like all of the other,
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.460]   uh, American children around with regard to how they handle money?
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.380]   So, so for that, I had been thinking for quite a bit.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.020]   I don't have children yet, but down the line, once I have, my goal is to take them India
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.140]   every year for their summer vacation.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.940]   So by the time I hope I will be financially independent and I can take their whole summer
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.860]   vacation, then to India so they can, they can learn our culture and things in India
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.780]   so that then I can, you know, then I can tell them about finance and then I can teach about
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.180]   finance and things to, to them.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.900]   But they have to go outside of US to learn those things.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.620]   That's what I believe for now.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.340]   But yeah, you never know.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.980]   Well, man, this has been great.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.940]   Anything else that you want to share before we wrap up here?
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.460]   Yeah, we haven't talked about travel hacking.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.380]   I do a bunch of travel hacking.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.220]   Tell us what you've learned.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.420]   So my credit score is more than 750 for me and my spouse and I do apply like, okay, three
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.580]   credit cards for me every three months and three for my wife.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.940]   So six cars every three months.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:25.740]   So I have been traveling literally for like $22 wherever I want to go in US or even Hawaii.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.980]   So because I use my points and miles.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.380]   So yeah, that's the way I travel.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.260]   How have you learned about these skills?
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.420]   So before I learned about finance, you know, I was just as I, as I told you, as I mentioned
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.820]   earlier, I started my job and I had a lot of free time.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.580]   I mean, you just work eight over a day here, right?
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.420]   And then you come home and you have free time.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.640]   So what are you supposed to do?
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.040]   So I started reading about this travel blogs and it says like, if you apply this card,
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.000]   you get 50,000 points, you know, and I'm pretty good at paying my bills on time.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.300]   I have zero late payment so far in one and a half, two years.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.800]   So I'm pretty good with that.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.140]   So I'm like, okay, let me take the benefit of system.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.560]   You know, if they allow here, then why not?
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   That's awesome.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.720]   And you're not, and you're not even a citizen of the United States yet, but you can still
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.920]   access the travel hacking system.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.160]   That's awesome.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.880]   Anything else that you want to share?
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.520]   No, that's so far I have, you know, achieved in US.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.960]   So I'm excited for, I'm excited for your future and I hope that you'd be able to gain access
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.840]   to a residency program.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.240]   And I'm sure that if you continue, if you continue forward, I'm sure that you'll find
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.720]   an opportunity and I congratulate you on all your progress, on all your progress thus far,
