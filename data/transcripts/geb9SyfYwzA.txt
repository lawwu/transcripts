[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.400]   - Thanks for listening to Ask Pastor John
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.840]   with longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.880]   Well, about a year ago, we recorded an episode titled,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.200]   "My Midlife Crisis in Counsel for Yours,"
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.240]   episode 1137 in the archive.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.320]   It was a very personal autobiographical account
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.400]   of a season of your life, Pastor John,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   and it's now been listened to about 200,000 times.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.340]   It's generated a load of grateful emails in the inbox,
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.040]   and since then, we've gotten a lot of emails
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.960]   from guys going through this season of life who,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.760]   well, really just want you to talk more about it.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360]   Here's one from a listener named Leo.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.340]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for your APJ episode
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.380]   on your own midlife crisis.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.680]   That's where I'm at now, and you have helped me to see
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.020]   that I am not alone, thank you.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.980]   I was wondering if it was a combination of mission,
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.120]   life, stress, and genetics that caused you to feel at times
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960]   like crying and having a deep sense of depression.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.120]   It seems complex, I recently reached 43,
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.040]   and noticed some changes in my mood
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.680]   and extreme depression at times.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.360]   Can you share more about your own experiences here?
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.080]   Well, I'm reluctant to talk about myself,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   since I think it creates a kind of pleasant bond
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.520]   (laughs)
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.200]   among us poor, wimpy guys.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.280]   (laughs)
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.320]   But it doesn't do us a lot of good in the end.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.200]   I mean, it's nice to have comrades in misery,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.720]   but it doesn't help all that much.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.400]   But I am willing, I mean, I didn't have to answer
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.360]   this question, you know, but I am willing to talk about it
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.760]   for two main reasons.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.880]   One, and it's the main one, is that the older I get,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.120]   the more I want to give God public, heartfelt,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   explicit credit and praise for keeping me
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.280]   through every kind of distress that I have experienced.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.920]   I really want to make known to as many people
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   as will listen that God has kept a hold of me,
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   and this is the decisive reason why I have kept hold of Him.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.060]   That's my first and main reason for being willing
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.740]   to say a few more words about this.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.740]   I want to give God glory for being a keeping, holding God.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.140]   The second reason why I'm willing to say another word
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.140]   about this experience is namely that God's keeping
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.100]   is manifest, so His divine act,
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.100]   His divine decisive keeping is manifest, shown, evident,
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.780]   precisely through our fighting to be kept.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.540]   Now, make sure you hear that rightly.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.540]   It's a little bit odd, so make sure you hear it rightly.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.480]   Not the other way around.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.200]   It's not that God is moved to keep us
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   by our fighting to be kept.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.460]   Are you with me?
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.560]   Let me say it again.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   It is not that God is moved to keep us
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.980]   by our initiative in fighting to be kept,
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.880]   but, let's turn it around now,
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   that God moves us to fight to be kept,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.900]   and thus, He keeps us.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.300]   If that sounds perplexing to you,
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.980]   that's why I'm willing to talk about this again.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.660]   'Cause if you don't get this,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.100]   you don't get the Christian life
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.500]   and how God sovereignly keeps His own.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.740]   Now, first, the decisive thing to say
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.420]   about any Christian midlife crisis,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.660]   I say Christian midlife crisis,
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.280]   is that God and God alone is the decisive one
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.200]   in getting us through,
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.800]   so that we remain faithful to Him for a lifetime.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.140]   God may use a thousand things.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.360]   I mean, He mentions genetics and stress and all that stuff.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.400]   That's absolutely right.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.880]   I mean, who can fathom all the reasons
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.960]   why we go up or down or why we come out,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   you know, go back?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.020]   Who can fathom the practical horizontal effects
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.980]   that are at work, thousands of them, not just four.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.780]   God may use a thousand things to keep us back
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.780]   from the cliff of pride and greed
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.180]   and sexual immorality and apostasy.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.180]   But whatever the means, the horizontal means are,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.120]   that we and others can see in our lives
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.940]   and the lives of others, whatever the means are,
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.940]   what is always decisive is the invisible power of God.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.080]   The greatest benediction in all the Bible, mark this,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.740]   the greatest benediction, I think,
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.140]   there may be another one greater, but I don't know of it,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.520]   the greatest benediction in all the Bible
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   is spoken in celebration of God's keeping.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.840]   That's amazing.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.600]   So here it is, "Now unto him who is able to keep you
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.800]   from stumbling and to present you blameless
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.840]   before the presence of his glory with great joy,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.320]   to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.800]   our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.920]   authority before all time, now, forever, amen."
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.400]   I mean, that's stupendous.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.960]   I mean, that's just over the top.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.680]   What's he praising?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.760]   He's praising, "He kept me.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.360]   He just kept me."
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.280]   So, I mean, if you don't feel amazed
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.600]   that you woke up a Christian this morning,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.920]   you don't get it.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.120]   You just don't get it.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.800]   Because if God hadn't kept you at 3 a.m.,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.240]   you'd wake up at 6 a.m., an unbeliever.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.800]   That's stupendous.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.280]   Peter puts it like this,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.240]   "Who by God's power are being kept
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.200]   through faith for a salvation
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.040]   ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.000]   How are we being kept?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.920]   By God's power.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.840]   How does it work?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   It works by awakening in us faith every morning.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.760]   Or Paul, more than anyone else,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.800]   bless him, love him, oh, I love Paul.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.000]   More than anyone else felt the wonder
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.440]   and the force of God's keeping.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.560]   1 Corinthians 1.8, "He will sustain you to the end,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.080]   guiltless in the day of Christ.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.120]   God is faithful by whom you were called
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.080]   into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.880]   In other words, he keeps whom he calls.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.520]   Or Philippians 1.6, "I am sure of this,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.640]   that he who began a good work in you
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.160]   will bring it to completion at the day of Christ."
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.440]   He began it, he will finish it.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.520]   You won't finish it, he will finish it decisively,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   and that's why you will finish it.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   Or 1 Corinthians 10.13, "God is faithful.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.160]   He will not let you be tested beyond what you are able,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.520]   but with the test, he will make a way of escape
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.960]   that you may be able to endure it."
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.880]   Don't miss the word endure.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   The escape from the test is through the enduring,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.280]   and that is the work of God.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.560]   So that's my first and main aim
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   in looking at this issue of midlife crisis again,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.680]   just to give God all the credit
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   for every stitch of endurance and perseverance.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   But here's the other aim, namely to communicate clearly
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.280]   that God's keeping is manifest,
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   shown precisely through our fighting to be kept.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.680]   I'm gonna say it again, 'cause this is just so perplexing
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.320]   why people have a hard time getting this,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.000]   and yet they do.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   God's keeping, God's decisive, sovereign keeping of his own,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.600]   his children, is manifest.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   It works itself out, it is shown,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.360]   it is evident in our lives,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   experientially, precisely through our fighting to be kept.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.040]   If you are fighting to be kept, God is at work in you,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.840]   and that's the key statement in say, 1 Corinthians 9, 26,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.480]   Paul says, "I do not run aimlessly.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.560]   I do not box as one beating the air.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   I pommel my body and keep it under control,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.760]   lest after preaching to others,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.560]   I myself should be disqualified."
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.800]   And it's amazing.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.760]   Paul believed that if he let down his boxing guard,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.920]   I mean, I don't know when people are gonna listen to this,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.160]   but just three days ago,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.880]   there was a big heavyweight boxing match.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.640]   I saw the headlines, so I clicked on it.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.560]   These people all paid, who knows, $100 for a line
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.880]   to get to watch this boxing match for 15 rounds,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.400]   and it ends in 28 seconds.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.160]   (laughs)
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.280]   I love it.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.920]   Because this guy lets down,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   he lets down his guard and whammo, he's on the floor,
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.480]   knocked out in just a few seconds.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.960]   And Paul believed, "If I let down my boxing guard
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.320]   for a moment, sin will deliver a knockout blow to me.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.240]   It really will."
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.000]   And that's how God keeps Paul.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.960]   He makes him a fighter.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   He says in Philippians 3, 12,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   "Not that I have already obtained this
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.400]   or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.480]   I press on, I press on to make it my own
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.760]   because Christ Jesus has made me his own."
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.600]   Beautiful.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.520]   I press on, I lay hold of, why?
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.240]   I've been laid hold of.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.720]   I've been taken.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.080]   I'm in his hands.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.720]   I'm just grasping what I've been grasped for.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.960]   Yes, I really run the race, but he is running in me.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.640]   Just like he says in 1 Corinthians 15, 10,
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.440]   "By the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.400]   His grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.560]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   though it was not I, but the grace of God was with me."
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.400]   So as I look back over my 30s and 40s,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.360]   indeed, my 20s through my 70s,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   as I look back over my life, I have never stopped fighting.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.600]   I don't remember any season.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.880]   I don't remember a week.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.360]   I wrote a whole book entitled "How to Fight for Joy."
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.880]   That's not an accident.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.600]   (laughs)
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.760]   A whole book on how to fight for joy.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.120]   When I don't desire God, how to fight for joy.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.080]   I have never stopped fighting to tremble,
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.400]   fighting to tremble at God's severity.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.160]   I have never stopped fighting to rejoice at God's kindness.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.800]   I cannot remember missing a day
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.040]   that I was not in God's word and in prayer.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.680]   I suspect there were some, okay?
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.640]   I'm not claiming any perfection.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.120]   I just can't remember any.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.360]   It's that much a part of my life.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.120]   Every day is a day of pleading over the word
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.960]   that I would be kept and shaped
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.800]   according to the God I see in the Bible.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.080]   And I've never tried to go it alone.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.520]   I'll end with this.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.840]   I've never tried to go it alone.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.920]   It's easy to go it alone.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.200]   It's easy just to, I mean, people are hard, right?
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.880]   People cause us the most problems.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.560]   I mean, books, they're not a problem.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   People are a problem.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.600]   But I know that's not right.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.240]   I know that's not biblical.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.560]   Hebrews 3:12, "Take care, brothers,
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.440]   lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.920]   leading you to fall away from the living God."
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.240]   Well, how, how, how am I gonna take care?
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.880]   Here's the answer, verse 13,
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.760]   "Exhort one another every day,
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.720]   as long as it is called today,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.320]   that none of you may be hardened
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.520]   by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.840]   So, here's my lesson.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.960]   Trust God's sovereign keeping.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.440]   And in that confidence, cut off your hands
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.160]   and tear out your eyes and fight for a greater joy
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.040]   than any sin could ever bring.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.880]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   Fighting as a means of God's keeping.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.320]   That is a really, really good point.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   And again, that earlier episode that I mentioned
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.880]   at the beginning, "My Midlife Crisis and Counsel for Yours,"
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.440]   that's episode number 1173 in the archive, 1173.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.320]   You can find it at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.560]   Tocophobia is the fear of childbirth.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.280]   It's the fear of the pain of childbirth
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   and the fear of childbirth injury,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.360]   both for baby and for mom.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.560]   It's not uncommon.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.600]   It's a question we get in the inbox regularly
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.040]   from a number of women.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.840]   The prospect of parenthood can be alluring,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.880]   but the pain of childbirth can be very unappealing as well.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.400]   And on Monday, when we return,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.440]   we're gonna look at whether or not
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.120]   this fear should be a deal breaker
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.280]   for a young couple that wants to be engaged.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.240]   That's on Monday when we return.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.200]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
