[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   It's like you take the great urban food industries, you say, you know what, we're going to have one
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.480]   publicly managed canteen, and it's going to provide all the food in New York City, and we're not going
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.600]   to allow any competitors or the competitors are going to have to pay a totally different thing.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.560]   That canteen is probably going to serve pretty crappy food. And that's in some sense,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.800]   what happens when you have a large scale public monopoly that replaces private competition.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   But isn't that also true of rural schools? So why are urban schools often worse?
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.040]   There's much more competition in suburban schools, the role of public sector unions,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.440]   and particularly teachers unions in these cases. In the case of a suburban school district,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.400]   the teachers union is no more empowered on the management side than they would be in the private
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.280]   sector. If you go into a big city school district, the teachers tend to be highly involved politically
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.360]   and quite capable of influencing management. You're talking about a larger group of disparate
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440]   parents, many of whom have, you know, lots of challenges to face, and it becomes much harder
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.240]   for them to sort of organize effectively on the other side.
