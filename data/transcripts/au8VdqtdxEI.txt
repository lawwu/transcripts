[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   It's how many people are listening that have a favorite movie and they watch it and they
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.260]   know what happens and they still like it.
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.660]   It's not because it's so cleverly written that you're just like magic with words.
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.980]   It's like you follow the story beat by beat by beat and that's what makes it interesting
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.060]   and that's what makes it fun and that's what leads you.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.860]   So when I talk about storytelling, I'm not telling people how to tell the story of how
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.820]   they came to be in this piece and why this is going to work for someone.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.860]   I see a lot of that it's a terrible idea because nobody wants your story to be wordsmith for
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.860]   them.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.860]   Right?
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860]   They want to get to the point.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.860]   They want to get to the point.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.860]   If I'm there to be entertained, okay, wordsmith me.
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.860]   Make it fun.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.260]   But if I want something from you or you want something from me, can we just get to the
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.980]   point, right?
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.980]   Here's what it is.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.780]   Which will tell, which then you want to know how it works.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.660]   Then once you understand, you want to know is that like, is that, could that be real?
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.820]   Could that actually do what you think it is?
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.820]   Oh yeah.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.820]   Okay.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.820]   Well, how does that, how do I get that?
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.100]   Or how does this actually get there?
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.620]   Like that's what a story builds, right?
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.060]   That's how storytelling in Hollywood works.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.500]   You inform people and lead them to the conclusion.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.060]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.060]   money and travel.
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.260]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and each week I sit down with the world's best experts
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.980]   to learn the strategies, tactics and frameworks that shaped their success.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.420]   Before we get started, big shout out to Chris Van Vliet, who hosts the fantastic podcast
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.100]   Insight, who introduced me to my guest today, Brant Penvidic.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.180]   Brant is an award-winning film director and veteran television producer with decades of
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.180]   experience working on shows like MasterChef and The Biggest Loser.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.860]   He's also a C-level sales and presentation coach and keynote speaker.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.580]   But I found him through his bestselling book, The Three Minute Rule, say less to get more
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.540]   from any pitch or presentation, which teaches anyone how to use Hollywood's storytelling
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.780]   techniques in business to persuade and succeed.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.900]   Today we're going to talk about why it's critical to dial in your pitch in the first three minutes,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.980]   maybe even the first 10 seconds, including how to do it, why in those three minutes you
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660]   need to answer four questions so people won't tune you out, and of course, what those questions
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.180]   are and how to answer them succinctly.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.480]   I'm going to ask him what he thinks of my pitch for all the hacks and how to improve
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   it.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420]   And I want to hear about his travel adventures.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.340]   Last year, his family sold their home and took a 48-state RV trip.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.380]   I want to know what he learned and whether he'd do it again.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.180]   And I'm sure there will be more.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.180]   So let's get started.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.180]   Brant, welcome to the show.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.180]   Hey, what's up, man?
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.180]   Happy to be here.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.180]   So let's just jump right into this three-minute rule.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.180]   Dive in.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:53.380]   You've said it's really a way to teach people how to use the Hollywood storytelling
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.140]   techniques to say less and get more.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.860]   How did you get so good at pitching shows and persuading people?
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.940]   And how did that lead to this three-minute rule?
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.260]   Listen, I'm a Hollywood producer by trade.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.220]   When I was early to the business, I was running around, pitching shows and trying to make
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.220]   my way.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.220]   And I was at the lobby of CBS.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.220]   I remember when this happened.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.860]   I was in the lobby of CBS and getting ready to go in for my pitch meeting.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.220]   And as I was there, I walked from the pitch room, Simon Cowell.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.660]   And I was like, "Oh, hey, Simon."
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.740]   And we were chatting a little bit and I was thinking to myself, "Oh, man, I hate pitching
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.740]   after that guy.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.740]   Like, you know, who's not excited to hear his pitch, which is great."
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.260]   And so as we're chatting, I could see him looking over my shoulder.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.500]   And when that happens, I look over and it's Mark Burnett.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.140]   And so Mark Burnett is coming in right after me.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.960]   And I'm thinking like, so now I'm wedged between these two superstars, right?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.740]   And I got such anxiety.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.920]   I am such a newbie and no one, like, no one cares.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.300]   And I'm going into the pitch, the president of the network.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.580]   What am I going to say?
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.700]   Like, what sort of fun thing, small talk, crap am I going to go through that makes this
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.940]   make any sense that the president is going to want to hear?
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.460]   Like he's not going to care.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.620]   So I just got into this panic.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.180]   And as I was in the room and we, you know, said hi, and everybody sat down, I was like,
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.180]   I got to get out of this room.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.580]   Like, I just, I got to just tell them what the show is.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.580]   I got to get the hell out of here.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.500]   Like, they don't want to hear from me.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.660]   So I literally just said like, "Here's the show.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.660]   Here's how we would produce it.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.020]   Here's why we think it's good for you.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.300]   Here's what we think it's going to cost.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.180]   And I'm out of here."
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.220]   And I was in and out of that minute in nine minutes.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.300]   And my agent was like, "Oh my God, that was the best pitch we've ever done."
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.040]   And CBS bought the show.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.420]   And so I started doing that more often where I was just like, "Okay, so what if I don't
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.860]   tell Fox about how product placement in this show is going to work?"
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.700]   Because you know, they do that for a living and they kind of have an entire department.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.500]   Like they don't need to hear from me.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.460]   And I remember being in NBC and the guy who ran it was like a very, very good producer,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.780]   like on my side of the field, and went over to run the network.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.220]   And so I remember pitching shows and being like, "Why am I getting in all this crap with
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.220]   him?
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.220]   He's a better producer than I am."
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.740]   Like, once I gave him the basic idea, like he's going to figure this stuff out, right?
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.160]   So I got this reputation very quickly about having some of the best pitches in Hollywood.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.260]   And the irony was, it was like, I wasn't really doing anything.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.260]   Like I was doing less.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.460]   I was saying less.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.180]   I wasn't trying as hard.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.660]   I happened to be conveying more confidence.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.500]   I was able to get the buyers to offer more of their suggestions, like everything just
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.520]   started going my way.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.620]   And so we started to develop this system that it was like what we use in the edit bay of
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.620]   a three minute scene.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.660]   Like you can't have a scene go more than three minutes.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.180]   You have to resolve all the conflict, blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.880]   And it's like, there's a lot of science behind three minutes itself about how the human brain
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.700]   processes information and makes decisions.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.140]   And so I just realized like, I'm using this three minute rule across everything.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.700]   And when I started to apply that across other businesses besides television, it worked even
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.860]   better than it did in television.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.180]   So that's how it all started.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.260]   You also mentioned that, you know, there's like the three minute version and the 10 second
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.780]   version and some people make even quicker judgments.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.200]   How do you think about the span of that three minutes?
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.980]   The three minute rule basically says that everything about your business, product or
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.100]   service must be conveyed clearly, concisely and accurately in three minutes or less.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.940]   The key is you need to get your audience to buy into the general concept before they make
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.260]   the yes or no decision.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.220]   Everybody listening to this right now has had someone come pitch or present them or
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.420]   want to get them to do something.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.260]   And in the first 10 seconds, you're already thinking, I don't think I like this.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.300]   I know I'm sure I want this, right?
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.180]   And that's because the person has not let you grow into that decision.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.300]   You have been forced to make that instantly by big statements and there's a whole bunch
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.180]   of things that I talk about in the book on how you get people to be almost defensive,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.900]   almost make a decision and then defend it as opposed to get all the information and
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.900]   then make a decision.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.900]   And so the three minute rule, if you do it really well, you could extend someone's yes
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.780]   or no in their mind to about a maximum of three minutes if you do it really well.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.020]   But you don't need three minutes, a minute and a half, sometimes two minutes, whatever
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   is required.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.780]   It is about what needs to be said, not what you want to be said.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.220]   So there's a book, people can read it.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.220]   I enjoyed it.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.580]   I would highly recommend it.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.020]   But what's the high level of how you lay out those three minutes?
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.600]   So it's called the WAC method, W-H-A-C.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.140]   And that's basically the structure for any pitch or presentation, how you can convey
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.140]   the information.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.780]   Anytime you want to convey something to someone or convince them to do something or try to
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.260]   get them to your way of thinking, think of it in the WAC method, W-H-A-C.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.580]   The W is what is this?
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.820]   Literally, what is it?
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.380]   H is how does it work?
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.220]   Those are the first two questions anybody has on anything that's going on.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.940]   If you've ever had somebody droning on about something and you're like, well, just tell
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.340]   me what this is and how it works.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.620]   That's all your brain wants.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.520]   It needs to find that.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.660]   It's called a three step rationalization.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.220]   First we conceptualize, we have to understand what it is.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.020]   Then we contextualize, we got to put context to us, how it works for us.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.620]   And then we actualize, which is, okay, how do I get it?
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.500]   So what is it is literally tell me what it is.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:34.340]   I am a personal trainer that trains Hollywood actors for major action films.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.580]   That is one sentence.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.940]   And everybody listening now has a pretty good idea what my buddy Jeff does.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.980]   You actually kind of know it right away.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.980]   That's what is it?
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.180]   Then it's how does it work?
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.340]   Okay, well, how does he do that?
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.900]   I move in to the celebrity's home and live with them for 90 days.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.700]   So they never break program, never break diet.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.180]   Okay, that is two sentences.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.380]   Now do I really need to go into all that much or have you already made an idea of how this
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380]   works?
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380]   Right?
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.380]   Your brain is saying, I get what he does.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.840]   I get his method.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.020]   Now you're either interested, not interested, whatever, but like you're there, right?
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.020]   I want this guy to move into my house.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.020]   There you go.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.020]   You're like, that's kind of cool.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.020]   Okay.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.540]   The next is the A, are you sure?
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.500]   Are you sure it's sort of like, wait, can you validate that?
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   Like I don't care about your facts and your figures until I understand what it is you
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.500]   do.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.180]   People want to start with their history and their stats and all the size of the market
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.580]   and all this other crap that no one cares about until I have context and structure.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   That's it.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:47.020]   So when you talk about, are you sure I'm using it as a second phase, which is like, I have
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.980]   given you the basic of what I do and how it works, and now I'm going to explain to you
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.980]   the value of it.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.440]   I'm going to give you some context, how it works for you.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.120]   I trained Chris Hemsworth.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.940]   I trained the rock.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.900]   I trained Mark Wahlberg.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.980]   Now you're like, okay, so you're pretty good at your gig.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.980]   Or I know those aesthetics.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.980]   That's what I got.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.980]   I understand that.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.020]   Or, you know, like I've done this for 15 years.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.140]   Like that's the, are you sure about it?
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.500]   I trained Hollywood actors for big action films.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.100]   I moved into their house nine days.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   They never met.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.820]   You know, they never, I've trained some of the biggest actors in Hollywood, including
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.820]   by make light.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.820]   Right.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.820]   Three sentences.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.260]   And now you're like, okay, I get it.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.900]   And then the final piece is, can you do it?
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.700]   Which is effectively what do I have to do to make this happen?
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.340]   Like how much is it going to cost?
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.940]   Do you have a patent?
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.940]   When is it available?
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.620]   How's the supply?
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.020]   How do you get paid?
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   Like all those things.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.020]   All those things about the actualization of the element.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.860]   Come later, come later, come later.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.860]   Right.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.860]   After all this stuff is done.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.860]   Now I care about that.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:57.340]   And the irony is it's the smallest piece, the smallest piece is like how much does it cost?
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.340]   Is it available now?
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.420]   It's like, if I buy into everything else, I will find a way to make the, can you do
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.420]   it work?
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.180]   If you're like, if you have this great idea and all these things work, but at the end
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.020]   of it, you're like, but I've never done before.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.020]   I'm not even sure how to do it.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.340]   You're like, okay, well, let's figure that out.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.340]   Right.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.340]   And like for Jeff says, can you do it is like, I only work with major studios.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.220]   They pay me directly per film.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.100]   My booking right now is nine months in advance.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.100]   Okay.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.300]   So now you're like, oh my God.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.300]   I totally get it.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   Right.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.300]   That's basically his pitch.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.940]   Now from that point, the conversation opens up.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.940]   Right.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.940]   Everything starts opening up.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.940]   Like, when did you get started?
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.940]   How often does it work?
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.940]   What do we do for food?
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.940]   Who pays for that?
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.940]   Where do you live?
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.620]   You have a million questions at a million conversations to have from that pitch.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.680]   You just can't put all of that in the pitch.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.740]   You have to trust the fact that if you get people to those first basic structures and
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.040]   get them through that, they're going to want to know more.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.940]   If you can't get someone to be interested in those basic structures, you have no hope
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.980]   of getting them interested just by talking more and giving them more information.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.320]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.940]   It has the opposite effect.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.700]   The more you talk, the less confident you appear, the less value you convey.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.060]   That is the end of the story.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.200]   After you've conveyed all that, whether it's minute and a half, three minutes, is it silence?
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.740]   Just let people ask questions?
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.220]   Your example, you went nine minutes.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   It's like there's two versions.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.980]   One is you have somebody that's like an interactive person.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.640]   That's usually where it's like questions kind of thing.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.900]   You're a minute and a half in and you've got the basic points and then you can start talking
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.340]   about elements like they understand, asking questions, have them go through stuff.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.340]   That's easy.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.340]   A lot of times you're making a presentation to multiple people and you can't just be like,
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.900]   "Okay, I'll take questions from the field."
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.340]   What I normally do is have a transition that feels like you would say, "I'm going to answer
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.480]   some of the questions I'm sure you probably have."
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.700]   Because what you're doing then is let's get into the engagement.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.060]   Let's get into the details, the nitty gritty, the stuff that you're going to find interesting
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.180]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:13.460]   So that helps people get that transition between like, "Now we're engaging and now I'm informing."
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.420]   The first step is to inform and lead and then the next stage too is engage and follow.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.740]   It's like those two are very separate pieces.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.540]   It's the one thing I find most people get mixed up is they try to start an engagement
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.460]   conversation before anybody really understands what it is they're working with.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.780]   When you work with people or help people for examples, how long does it take to get that
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.780]   minute and a half?
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.780]   It seems like...
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.780]   Or three minutes.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.300]   It seems like if it's the most important thing, you should be spending the bulk of your planning
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.180]   on honing that first pitch.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.180]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.420]   It's taken me 20 years to learn how to say things in three minutes, right?
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:55.740]   So it's difficult, and it's more difficult depending on how big your personality is.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:02.460]   Ironically, I train a lot of companies and some of my best students are the biotech scientist
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:09.220]   type guys with the most complex of companies and drug therapies and whatnot.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.900]   And oil and gas guys are good too, because they don't want to perform.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.700]   They don't want to overcome the audience with their cool awesomeness.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.460]   They just want to tell people what's going on.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.420]   They're excited about their product, they're excited about their company, and it's like
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.660]   I can strip all that down for them and be like, "Just tell these things and you'll get
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.180]   to say all this other stuff about the gene therapy and you'll get there.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.380]   Just say these things so people understand and then they'll want to talk."
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.540]   And they love that.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.980]   But it takes me a full day.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.980]   I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.420]   When I wrote the book, the publisher was like, "Hey, don't write the forward to the book
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.540]   until you're done the entire book, because then you'll know all the details and you can
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.540]   really nail that," right?
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.620]   Because that's how people decide they're going to read a book.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.620]   So I did a little research.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.460]   Turns out people in a business book read usually the first four to six pages before they make
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.460]   a decision.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.740]   Then the average business book has a forward of 11 pages.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.980]   And I was like, "Four pages is about three minutes to read.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.980]   No surprise."
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.820]   So I was like, "Oh my God, this is genius.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.220]   I'm going to start the book saying that.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.740]   The average business book is 11 pages, the average publisher takes four pages, that takes
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.740]   three minutes."
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.260]   So I got three minutes to make you want to basically read the rest of the book, right?
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.460]   I was like, "Yeah, this is going to be great.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.020]   Three-minute push for my book."
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.980]   So I went on vacation because I had finished the book.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.940]   I'm in Jamaica, my wife.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.100]   And I was like, "Great, I'm going to take the first day or so, I'm going to write this
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.820]   intro and send it off to the publisher and then I'm going to take the rest two weeks
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.540]   and stay on the beach and have a good time."
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.500]   First pass of writing my forward for the book, 14 pages long.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.500]   Right?
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   And it was good.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.860]   I was like, "Oh my God."
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:46.260]   So I cut it down and I spent the next day just trying to edit it and it's 10 pages long.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.980]   Nine pages, eight pages, I got to seven pages.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.220]   And then I start negotiating with myself, "Well, this is so good.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.420]   It's written so well.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.980]   I really need people to hear this right away.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.060]   I can't wait till later.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.180]   Maybe this is the time when it's this good and this important that the three-minute thing
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.580]   isn't as important.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   Maybe it's just I can..."
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.580]   Right?
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.780]   So then I was like, "What the hell is wrong with me?"
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.140]   So I even called the publisher and I asked him, "Is it four pages?
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.380]   Is that just any size page or is it words?"
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.900]   He's like, "No, it's words.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.900]   That's how it works."
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.820]   So I'm looking at the word count and I'm like, "Oh my God."
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.340]   I couldn't finish it in two weeks.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.340]   Couldn't do it.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.340]   Couldn't get it done on the trip.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.660]   I had to come back home.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   I had to go to my office.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.940]   I had to take out my sticky notes and do my entire whack method from the very beginning
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.500]   for my own book.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.120]   An expert who does this for a living.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.140]   And I had to take the whole thing and finally got it to my four pages.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.420]   It's just because I became so precious about the information.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:52.140]   And in fact, I don't tell a lot of people this, but there are drafts of the book that
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.820]   they use, these draft copies that they send around to some press and stuff like that before
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.500]   they print the final version.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.940]   There are a few draft copies that have, I'm going to say three quarters of a paragraph
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.460]   or three quarters of a page from my original intro that I pushed into the first chapter
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.580]   because I was so in love with it.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.280]   And it wasn't until after it all said done, I read it again, I was like, "Oh my God,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   this is total drivel.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   This is crap."
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.100]   And I forced my publisher to take it out and redo it.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.540]   I still think there's one or two sentences I probably could have cut.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.340]   But when you're precious about your information and when you're really passionate, it's
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.780]   very difficult to chop the bodies away and kill the dead weight.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:35.620]   And so for me, with clients, it's very, very different because I can tell you right
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.980]   away what's dead weight.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.300]   I can tell you right away what to put off to the side and weight.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.660]   So the book really trains you to try to find those pieces.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.020]   It isn't like, "Hey, wear this certain color tie and your pitch will be better."
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   It's like, "No."
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.780]   It's like, "Here's the way to find out what you should be saying first, what you
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.180]   should be saying second, what should you be saying last, and what you shouldn't be
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.180]   saying at all."
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.740]   So I want to go two places, but I'll ask one quick question.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.940]   You said, "This isn't the color tie."
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.260]   Does it even matter what you wear to a pitch?
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.260]   No.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.260]   No, none of that matters.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.260]   It doesn't matter what you say.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.140]   None of that crap matters anymore.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.660]   People are so inundated with information and details and all this crap, they're just not
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.940]   interested in all those other things.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.940]   None of that works.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.940]   We should train salespeople to use their person's name.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   "Hi, Dave."
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.940]   "Hi, John."
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.940]   "How are you, John?"
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.940]   "Have you ever thought about this, John?"
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.700]   Use your client's name over and over again.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.540]   Could you imagine if someone did that to you today?
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.980]   That's the reality of a hypersensitive audience.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.860]   I mean, unless you're doing something that's a detriment, none of that stuff impacts you
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.860]   whatsoever.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.260]   Everybody wants to sift through that and get to the good stuff.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.460]   And then the second, I'm going to go in.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.260]   I sent you this in advance, so I'm going to ask you about my show.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:49.580]   I'm constantly talking to everyone from sponsors or shows for me to go on and try to explain
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.340]   what we do.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.660]   And I'm super passionate.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.780]   So if you're great, because it's not your show, at knocking down the bodies to try to
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.860]   narrow it down, I'm curious what you thought of what I sent.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.340]   And this was the description of all the hacks.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.260]   I'll give you that in two pieces.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.340]   Your description of the show, your intro of the show, what the show is, is really good.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.500]   Super solid, right?
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.220]   Because you're doing it for the consumer, there's not a lot to get into what a podcast
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   is and what it contains.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.660]   And you were pretty clear about like, "Hey, I gave you all the great travel hacks, saved
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.660]   money.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.660]   I got more fun stuff."
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.260]   It's nice and clean.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.060]   Could it be a little bit less wordy?
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   Sure.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   Would it make any difference?
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.060]   Most likely not.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.700]   It's relatively simple.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.860]   You keep it relatively simple.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.660]   I will say that your outreach email to get people like me and Chris and other people
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:45.380]   on is way too pretty, and conveys a sense of, not desperation is too much, but conveys
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.980]   a sense of less value than you want to convey, right?
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.540]   Because you're pitching like, here's the size of the audience, which is impressive.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.540]   Here's this stuff.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:02.460]   But it's like, if your show was like, if Joe Rogan wanted me on the podcast, do you think
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.540]   he'd put a paragraph in there about his show and how big it is and where it is, right?
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.540]   No.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.540]   He'd be like, "You want to be on my show?"
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.020]   I'd be like, "He doesn't want me on the show.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   I've asked him.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.580]   He said no."
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.820]   So that's the highest level, right?
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.940]   That's the top of the food chain.
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.060]   The lowest end is a podcast you've never heard of, that's like just starting.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.220]   And they are going to inundate you with facts and figures and information and pretty pleased.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.540]   And these are the people I worked with and like, "Let me prove myself to you.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.580]   Let me prove myself to you with words."
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:44.980]   And so, you're about a third too long in that.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:53.220]   Because these people are peers, your show kicks ass, and that outreach from you should
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.220]   be less.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.660]   It's like, "Hey, I got a podcast.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   I think you're cool.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.660]   I've heard you on other stuff.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.380]   I'd like you to be a guest.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.380]   Let's connect."
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.060]   When you're a new brand, and people probably don't know you, obviously, you don't want
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.060]   to...
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.300]   Joe Rogan, people know him, right?
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.300]   So he sends a message.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   Everyone knows him.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.020]   You want to come across like you're not desperate, but you also need some validation.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.260]   Is it just limit the validation?
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.020]   Yes, it's limit the validation.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.620]   Because if it comes across as you pitching or selling, you're dead.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.740]   It's over.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.660]   So what would you rather have?
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.460]   Someone who's kind of curious because you didn't give them a bunch of everything to
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.660]   figure out or someone who's just like, "This guy..."
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:39.700]   People and value, people of value, people value money moves away from whatever chases
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.700]   it.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.540]   That is just a fact.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:48.340]   Women, money, people, they move away from things that chase it.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.700]   And so if you sell, if you're pushing, if you're trying to convince, if you're trying
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.020]   to influence, people are repulsed by that.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.200]   They are repelled to go the other direction.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.220]   Now, sometimes what you have is so much value that you overcome that, but that is not where
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.780]   you want to be.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.700]   And if you're saying, "Hey, I want you to be on my podcast," there's only a couple of
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.620]   things that make sense to talk to somebody about, right?
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.060]   What does your podcast focus on?
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.860]   Is it a podcast about gyms?
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.620]   Is it a podcast about airline flights?
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.500]   Is it oil exploration?
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.660]   You got to explain that.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.140]   "Hey, I do this podcast, it's called this, it does this," right?
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:37.380]   If you have some credibility on the size and the scope and the people you've had is reasonable,
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.180]   but unfortunately, and that you know this, everybody knows this, that's everybody's going
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.340]   to say that, right?
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.740]   Everybody's going to say it's the number one podcast in this category, right?
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:55.940]   Or it's got 90,000 unique views or something, something, something, right?
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.620]   So that you just got to keep to a minimum because, and that's what you do if you were
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.420]   the number one podcast in the world, but no one knew you, I guess you'd say it's the number
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.420]   one podcast in the world.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.820]   Not like, "It's the number one podcast rule according to these things on this date by
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.100]   this measure, and you can verify it here.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.340]   Here's the link to see whether I'm the number one, and I've attached the certificate of
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.180]   my number one authenticity," like you wouldn't do that.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.820]   And irony, if you did, I'd be like, "This probably isn't real," right?
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:29.060]   And the more things you included to explain and validate it, the less I believe it.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.060]   That's the irony of it.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.300]   It's like the more you prove it, the less I want to accept it, right?
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.380]   Even if it's like, "Oh, okay."
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:43.340]   So your thing is like, you have great guests, present company excluded, you have good numbers,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.860]   it's a great show with a great, unique hook.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.500]   If you're reaching out for people to be as a guest, it's kind of like, that's all you
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.540]   really need to say from your perspective, right?
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.220]   And it's like, it'd be like, or the other way is like, imagine if you wanted to get
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.820]   my 16-year-old son as a guest, you'd be like, "Hey, man, I got a podcast, it does this.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.820]   Want to be a guest?"
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   Right?
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.100]   Okay, so there's the two extremes, right?
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.460]   Like, my son's nobody, he would die to be on anybody's podcast.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.580]   Joe Rogan is the greatest podcast, everybody wants to be on it.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.480]   Those two things and those two situations, you pitch them exactly the same, right?
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.740]   Very few words, almost understanding that you're going to want it, and if you want to
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.920]   get more details, like when, how, why, all that kind of stuff, great.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.900]   And that's normally what you'll end up getting, shorter that outreach, the more responses
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.580]   you'll get asking for things, right?
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.260]   "Do I need to do this?
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.260]   When do I do that?
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   How do you do this?
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.260]   What reach do you have?"
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.820]   - One thing that this just made me think about, so in a previous life, I was a founder of
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.140]   a tech company that raised money, and I found that one of the most effective things was
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.220]   to give everyone a really easy out.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.300]   So I know you have a different thought on closing than a lot, but I would always end,
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.540]   I would be trying to raise money, and I'd send an email follow up two days later and
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.860]   say, "Hey, just want to follow up, need to see if you need any more info.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.740]   If not, no worries, catch you next time."
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.380]   Like kind of give them this easy out, because a lot of people struggle with the no, and
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.940]   then you have the anxiety of them, "Oh, are they going to say yes?
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.940]   What are they going to say?"
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:16.500]   If you just make it so easy for someone to say no, they just give you the answer faster.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.500]   - That's part of it, right?
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:24.420]   You just want to make it clear that if what you were offering had real value, you wouldn't
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.980]   desperately need them, and if they didn't see the value, you wouldn't be like, "I need
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:34.360]   to convert your," no, "I need to overcome the pushback," right?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.700]   It's like, "What?"
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.740]   It's like, "No, you got other people to go deal with, people who will see the value.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.660]   If the person doesn't see the value, like, "Oh, buh-bye," that has to be what you convey
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.260]   in the words.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.900]   - In an in-person pitch, you had a perspective that I thought was maybe one of the most unique
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.540]   I've seen, and something that makes me want to go do an in-person pitch, which is on how
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.740]   you shouldn't actually wrap up.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.040]   - I always been cringy about that kind of stuff, because a lot of people want to wrap
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.740]   up their pitch with a fancy phrase or a saying.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.740]   I mean, think about when you watch Shark Tank, and it's like, "Hey, sharks, who wants to
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.740]   dive in here with me and swim?"
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.740]   Whatever, right?
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.740]   You're like, "Ugh."
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.660]   It's like, "Oh, yeah, you're pitching this.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.420]   Oh, yeah, you've rehearsed this.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.260]   Oh, yeah, this is your shtick," right?
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.540]   You've basically took them out of that moment of like, "I'm listening to your story," to
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.000]   be like, "Oh, sorry, we're pausing it for commercial break," effectively.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.980]   You're just like, it lets the room down.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.980]   I've never found a closing that makes people stand up and clap other than, "That's it,
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.780]   thanks," kind of thing.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.740]   And that's my idea, and that, "Welcome to this," whatever that last piece is, which
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.300]   is like, "I'm done.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.140]   I've explained it to you.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.740]   We're talking or I'm leaving."
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.340]   That's the vibe, right?
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.860]   If they have more they need from you, they will ask.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.780]   And that is a classic Hollywood ending, right?
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:03.060]   Because there was a guy who ran CBS, and he's famous for the most deadpan looks, no emotion.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.300]   You didn't know what was going to happen.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.300]   You left that room.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   You weren't sure if he loved it, hated it.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   It didn't matter.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   He was trained.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.260]   And the irony was the people who worked after him, they worked for him, they learned how
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.060]   to do that too, right?
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.620]   And if it didn't go well, if the pitch didn't go well, Gen would simply say, "Great, I got
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.620]   it.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.620]   Thanks."
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.620]   And that was it.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   Nothing else.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.620]   Right?
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.900]   So you're like, "Okay."
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.580]   And then if you'd ask a question, "Well, how are you going to deal with this in the third
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.580]   act?"
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.580]   You'd be like, "Oh, shit.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.580]   He's got...
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.580]   He's interested."
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.060]   And then you would engage, right?
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.100]   And that's the vibe that is hard to let people capture on their own.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.860]   You've got to find out what your audience thinks.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.020]   You can't convince...
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.840]   You can't push them.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.260]   You got to give them the basics, and then you'll know.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.460]   Is this something in your wheelhouse or not?
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.460]   And there's no...
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.620]   I mean, the amount of people that you can convert from an objection, and the amount
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:03.260]   of work that that takes, and the amount of lasting good that's created, that is so small
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.260]   in today's world.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.260]   It's not worth it.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:10.100]   So instead of objection handling, which I know they teach in sales, it's like, just
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.380]   move on.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.140]   It's better to go try again than to try to overcome every objection?
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.520]   It's not even close.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   It's not even close.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.780]   It's like an objection is somebody that basically has said, "I don't buy into this."
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.340]   Now it's different if they don't understand it.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.620]   And a lot of times what I'm dealing with is I'm dealing with companies who are trying
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:35.900]   to get through objections by giving the audience the information they should have given them
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.740]   in the beginning.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.220]   And so they're trying to handle objections that they're actually using the information
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.700]   they should have used in the beginning as like, "Oh, no, no, no, that's not what I mean,"
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.660]   or, "Oh, no, we can do this twice for you," or whatever it is.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.780]   Whereas when we retrain and go through it again, it's like, "Hey, here's all the objections
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.240]   kind of laid out."
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.680]   And if you're talking about objections like, "Hey, I need to talk to my wife because I'm
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:04.980]   not sure we can afford it, and your job is to close them," A, that's not my world.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.980]   I don't work with that kind of piece.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.100]   That's not what I do.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.820]   And I've been approached by a lot of companies that have that type of sales stuff.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:18.140]   And I worked with a very large company on their timeshare business.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:25.560]   And it's like, I just couldn't get them to really make the big enough changes, right?
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.520]   Because they're just a slow moving thing.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.760]   And their goal is to get people in an emotional state and trick them into signing.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.760]   And it's like, "Yeah, that's not what I do."
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.520]   Like, the timeshare is good for a certain group, a certain demographic this actually
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.880]   works really well for.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.440]   So why don't we just tell people how it works really, really well.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.300]   And if they fit in the demographic, they'll let you know.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.220]   And they're just like, "What?
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.120]   That's not how we do things.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.120]   We get them.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.120]   We force them into it.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.760]   We make them feel guilty.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   Every trick in the book."
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.160]   That's not my world.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.840]   I've gone to the timeshare pitches mostly out of curiosity to see how they do it.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.520]   But I have yet to ever say yes.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.720]   But one thing that I've tried in the past, I'm curious if you've seen it or used it.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.160]   When it comes to objections, I knew when I was raising money for my last company, I knew
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:15.480]   that if someone wanted a lot of information about customer acquisition, we just hadn't
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.480]   done it.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.000]   And I knew that it was the most common objection.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.240]   And I would just start the pitch.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.760]   I would walk in a bag.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.320]   After I explained what the company did, I would say, "Hey, I just want to pause.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.360]   We don't have customer acquisition data yet.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.880]   We have not gone through that part of the business.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.100]   If that is not something you guys need to see, we can just stop right now.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.300]   And we don't need to keep going."
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:42.400]   And a part of that was I wanted them to get over it because they wanted to see the rest.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.240]   They've already blocked off 30 minutes, they want to see the rest.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.140]   It's not necessarily going to work, but at least makes them less focused on this thing
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.720]   that they might say no to.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.120]   It's genius, right?
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   It's owning the negative.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.520]   And that's a big piece of storytelling is people get sucked into the idea that they're
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.440]   negative, what's negative about their pitch or what the downside is.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.200]   I start every development meeting when we're talking about television shows, it's like,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.600]   why is a network going to pass on this show?
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   Tell me why.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   What is the reason?
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   It doesn't fit with the brand.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   It's too hard to produce.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   We can't cast it properly.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   I don't think people are going to like it.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   It's not going to be relatable.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.800]   And it's like, okay, if I can't get past that in this room, the network's never going
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   to get past that.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.880]   It's like, if you pretend you don't know what the negative side is, there's not a lot of
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.280]   good options, right?
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.080]   One is your audience never brings it up.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.120]   And so they just think that you're either too dumb or you're hiding it from them.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.360]   Number two is they bring it up right there.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.960]   And now it's like, oh, you've got to scramble and answer it.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.560]   So what happens is, if you end up not mentioning it and they bring it up, you can answer it
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.880]   except for they've been thinking about it the entire time, right?
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   That's what they've been doing.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.840]   They've been talking and talking about it.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.720]   And that is a disaster.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.760]   You cannot have them doing that, right?
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.160]   And so the last option is you bring it up, because it's not going to be that they didn't
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.160]   figure it out.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.240]   They didn't understand what could be wrong here.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.080]   That's never going to happen.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.240]   So the negative is important.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.720]   How big it is and how much importance it has is all directly proportionate to where you
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.680]   sort of put it in the pitch, right?
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.240]   And by you talking about it right in front saying, "Hey, we don't customer acquisition
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   data.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.120]   So if that's an important thing, just know we don't do that.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.120]   We haven't done that yet."
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.560]   It's like, okay, that's done.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.280]   Now everything else hangs on it.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:36.020]   And when we end up having storytelling in Hollywood, you don't get in a moment where
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:42.000]   it's like in the Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne gets beaten up, but he looks like
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   he's going to die.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.680]   And you're not like, "Oh, what a wimp.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   I hate him.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   It's over.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   He's a loser."
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.680]   Right?
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   Rocky gets knocked down.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   You're like, "Oh, that's it.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   This movie sucks.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   He's a bum."
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   Right?
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.120]   It's like, all is lost is the setup for here's what's great.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.240]   That is the best part of it, right?
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.120]   When you talk about you're not having customer acquisition, and then you explain everything,
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.460]   your audience is then going to be like, "Ooh, I wonder how this customer acquisition could
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.460]   work."
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.380]   And they'll start overlaying their own excitement to get to the result they want, right?
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.140]   The negative can never hurt you, never hurt you in a pitch.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.700]   So you mentioned a lot of storytelling in that kind of response, but I noticed that
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.500]   when you gave your example of your buddy, Jeff, there wasn't really any storytelling.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.140]   Is it that storytelling maybe doesn't need to be part of the first three minutes with
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   the whack part?
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   No.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:38.340]   It's that people look at storytelling as, "Once upon a time, I was here," right?
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.700]   And that's not what storytelling is.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.340]   That's wordsmith.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.560]   That is wordplay.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.820]   Storytelling is, "Here's the situation.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.900]   Here's what's happening.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.260]   Here's what's going to happen next.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.260]   Here's why."
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.340]   Scripts are storytelling because they fill themselves with words, right?
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.140]   And they flow to the points.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:00.260]   The points are the elements of a story that lead you to the next piece.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.460]   How many people are listening that have a favorite movie, and they watch it, and they
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.340]   know what happens, and they still like it?
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.740]   It's not because it's so cleverly written that you're just like magic with words.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:20.300]   It's that you follow the story beat by beat by beat, and that's what makes it interesting,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.140]   and that's what makes it fun, and that's what leads you.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.940]   So when I talk about storytelling, I'm not telling people how to tell the story of how
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.900]   they came to be in this piece, and why this is going to work for someone.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   I see a lot of that.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   It's a terrible idea because nobody wants your story to be wordsmith for them, right?
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.980]   We want to get to the point.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.980]   They want to get to the point.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.940]   If I'm there to be entertained, okay, wordsmith me.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.940]   Make it fun.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.340]   But if I want something from you, or you want something from me, can we just get to the
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.100]   points, right?
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.900]   Here's what it is, which will tell ... Then you want to know how it works.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.740]   Then once you understand, you want to know, "Could that be real?
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.060]   Could that actually do what you think it is?
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.060]   Oh, yeah?
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.060]   Okay.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.060]   Well, how do I get that?
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.820]   Or how does it actually get there?"
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.700]   That's what a story builds, right?
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.140]   That's how storytelling in Hollywood works.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.640]   You inform people and lead them to the conclusion.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:20.220]   That's all Hollywood storytelling is, is leading people to the conclusion you want.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.980]   You know the boat sinks in Titanic.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.760]   You watch the film.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.720]   Andy Dufresne, you want him to escape from the prison at Shawshank.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.560]   You want it to happen.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.760]   We don't start that movie by saying, "Andy Dufresne escapes from a very bad prison.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.780]   Let me tell you why he does that."
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.100]   That's not how you tell a story.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.420]   Tell a story and be like, "Here's where he's at in this story.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.420]   Here's what he did.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.420]   Here's why he's in the prison.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.420]   Here are the conditions.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.420]   Here's his choices.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.420]   It looks like he's not going to make it."
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.300]   Then you're like, "Please escape," right?
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.860]   That's how a story is told.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:58.640]   Is there an example of that kind of storytelling with a pitch for a product or a service?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   Yes.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.440]   The way that I use that in a classic storytelling with wordsmithing sort of idea is in what's
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.200]   called the intro, that my reason for being.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:12.860]   It's the only time where that makes sense, where you want to explain to people the reason
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.520]   why they are there, you are there, we are here.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.640]   How did this come to be, right?
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:24.460]   It's like I started developing that technique when we were doing pilots and presentations
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.900]   for the networks.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.260]   Sometimes you'd send it in and they would take this DVD, they would take the DVD, put
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.860]   it in the DVD player, they'd watch your pilot and then they decide if they're going to buy
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.380]   it or not.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.140]   I just couldn't live with that, right?
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.660]   Because I didn't know there were things I wanted them to know about it and things that
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.120]   happened along the way.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:49.660]   I became very, very good at warming the room and creating the anticipation.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.780]   If I knew something might be an issue, I would be calling the head of the network and saying
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:57.180]   like, "Hey, by the way, I feel like our second act is really shallow here because I didn't
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.180]   have this scene.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.740]   I wanted to film it, so I feel like that second act drags a lot."
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.180]   They're like, "Okay, so now they're anticipating, so it can drag and it doesn't kill it."
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:12.320]   I would say like, "Hey, I would have added this longer because I love this scene so much,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.000]   but I know that your delivery, we need nine minutes of this act.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.960]   There is so much here that blank, blank, blank."
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.880]   I set that room tone.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.840]   So when they put the DVD in, they know exactly what to think, exactly how to feel, exactly
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.720]   what went into this and they can judge it on its merits.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.840]   Your pitch is kind of the same where it's like, "Well, how did you get here?
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.320]   How is your reason for being about why this product or service is interesting?
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.000]   How does that translate to why you're sitting there?"
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.320]   I'll give you a great example, one of my favorites from one of my favorite companies I've ever
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:48.200]   worked with is an electric vehicle controller manufacturer called X-Row Technologies.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.880]   They had come to me, the chairman had come to me a while ago and said, "Hey, will you
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   come on board?
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   We really need some help."
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   I looked at the company.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:01.360]   I was like, "Nah, too small, Canadian, small, micro cab company, no, not my world."
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.040]   I really liked this guy, but not going to happen.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.320]   He called me back three months later and he said, "Hey, listen, we just hired a new CEO,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   taken over.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.480]   She's moving to Calgary, the head office to start this up.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.840]   She could really use some help and I think you guys would hit it off."
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   And I was like, "Nah."
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:26.080]   And he said, "She's the CEO of GE, Small Industrial Motors, and she's leaving that gig."
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.140]   And I could not get my brain around why she would do that, right?
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.640]   And so when I talked to her on the phone, I said I'd talk to her and I asked her, I
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.340]   said, "Why would you take this job?
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.900]   Why would you leave one of the highest profile jobs in that business and move your entire
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:46.260]   family to Calgary, Alberta for this micro cab, infinitesimally small company?
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.820]   Why would you do that?"
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.220]   And she said, "Oh, well, do you know anything about electric motors?"
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.660]   I said, "Well, no, not really."
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.180]   She goes, "Well, I do.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:00.900]   And I've been looking for this technology since I was 12 years old, winding electric
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.940]   motors in my family's electric motor shop.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.580]   I know what this technology can do.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.580]   I could not resist."
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:13.260]   Everybody listening now wants to know what that technology is because I've set up that.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.260]   And so when she pitches shows, she would say, "I was CEO of GE, Small Industrial Motors.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.980]   I got a call from this company.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:24.940]   I ignored them for many time until I finally said one phrase that changed my life.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.820]   I said, 'Show me the technology.'
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.820]   And they did.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.940]   And 30 days later, I attended my resignation at GE and moved my entire family to Calgary,
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.600]   Alberta to take over as the CEO of Xro Technologies."
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.760]   And now you're like, "Okay."
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.720]   And then, you know, then that's the start of the pitch.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.260]   That's the story that leads you to be like, "So let me tell you a little bit about Xro.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.820]   We are a technology company that makes controllers for electric vehicles.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.640]   We use coil switching in a dynamic way to be the brains behind the way an electric vehicle
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.740]   performs.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:05.420]   With our coil switching technology, you can go farther and go faster on the same charge."
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.100]   And you're like, "What?"
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.180]   And then it's like, "Let me tell you the details of the technology."
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.620]   And then she, you know, then she gets into it.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:18.740]   And like, the power of that story in the beginning to set up that thing is very hard to ignore,
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.740]   right?
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.800]   Like, is that's how you lead somebody to that piece.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.140]   It's not always like that.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.340]   Sometimes you got to send a deck.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.260]   Sometimes people don't want to hear your little small talk in the beginning.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.340]   They just want you to play it.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.220]   But that's where classic sort of, "Let me tell you a story," fits in.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.660]   It should be the story of how you got there or why this counts, right?
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.180]   Is that the first part of every pitch?
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:47.340]   Almost every pitch has that because 90 times out of 100, you're going to have a conversation
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.820]   to begin the pitch, right?
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.220]   There's a conversation that's most of the time, like I said, sometimes you're just sending
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.220]   a deck or an email.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:58.020]   You're not going to be able to do that, but, you know, it becomes how did you get there?
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.520]   Why is this interesting?
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.620]   What compelled you to be there?
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.780]   Like the one I wrote in the book, it was like, you know, this woman, you know, show jumped
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.140]   with her horse.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.380]   She had an axle problem on the way to the event, she was on the side of the road.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.980]   The horses were freaking out and it was 9.30 at night.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.680]   Where do you put your horse, right?
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:24.740]   Like she's like, "Oh my God," and yet you could see in the area, there's got to be houses
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.880]   everywhere that have barns and stables, but like no way to access them.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   Know what to know.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   Everything's closed.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.540]   When she realized that's when she came up with bed and bale, which is Airbnb, but for
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.540]   horses.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.140]   Like, do you need a lot more?
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.900]   Like if you were an investor, if you were whatever, like now your questions are not
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   like, "Oh, what is this thing?
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.660]   How does this app work?" or like, "What's the driving force?"
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.540]   Like, it's like, okay, where are you?
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.980]   Like did you build the app?
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.100]   Like now you're engaged already because you get it.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.900]   Understanding is the fundamental importance for being engaged.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.460]   People who don't understand something can't engage with you, but if it's Airbnb for horses,
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.460]   people travel with horses, they need a place to put them.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:14.180]   There's houses all over America with barns, unused, you're like, "Uh, yeah, I get it,
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.260]   but I want to know this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this," right?
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.260]   - One thing you mentioned is, okay, so maybe if you have to send a deck, the intro isn't
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.700]   part of it.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   What do you think about...
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.700]   There are a lot of times where I've met people who are like, "Well, if someone tells me to
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:32.380]   send a deck, I try to force them into having the conversation in person."
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:37.340]   Do you think you should, as a business or a person selling anything, kind of hone all
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.340]   the mediums?
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.460]   - Unfortunately, yeah, because it's just like you try to push somebody to do an in-person
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.620]   meeting, if you can get that to happen, great.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.860]   But if your deck or your written material can't stand on its own, you're buggered, because
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.340]   if you think that person that you're pitching makes the ultimate decision and isn't going
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.660]   to share it with someone else or doesn't have to do that, that's never going to work, right?
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:05.180]   What's happening is we live in a sort of decision-by-committee world, and so they're going to have to rationalize
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.300]   why they liked it to somebody, and that means they're going to have to share your deck with
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.420]   them, and they're going to have to summarize your pitch, right?
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.500]   But if I told you and I sent you the deck for bed and bail, and I told you to go explain
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.700]   it to somebody, you'd say, "Airbnb for horses."
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.420]   It's because I already gave you that.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:30.260]   And so now the summary, it lives on its own, and the deck kind of reinforces that.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:37.340]   And so in her opening of that deck, it's like occasionally there'll be something about the
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:42.820]   story that led her there, but all I really needed from that story to get across to people
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:48.500]   is that there's nowhere for people who travel with horses to put them other than a professional
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.180]   kennel and those places close, right?
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.120]   It's not like a hotel where they're open for reservations all the time.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.980]   It's a stables, and so those people go home, right?
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.660]   So it's like, well, so that's really all I needed to convey.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.140]   That's the setup, right?
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.780]   Is it the problem?
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.180]   Sometimes it's the problem that you answer.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.500]   I find people get too detailed into that.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:20.820]   But really the part of the deck that makes the most impact is what is it?
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.820]   That's it.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.820]   That's what it is.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:23.820]   It's Airbnb for horses.
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.980]   Like that's the phrasing around that makes people go first page, second page.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:33.060]   Now they're like, "Okay, I'm going to read this because I want to find things out."
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.060]   Not I'm reading it.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.060]   It's four pages.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.060]   I don't really understand.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.500]   A lot of people listening have done that where they get a deck and they're looking through
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.740]   and they're like reading it and they're like, "I don't really get it."
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.340]   And so their first question is like, "I don't really understand how this works.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.060]   I don't really understand how that works."
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.060]   Right?
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.540]   And you're like, "Oh no, that was like page four on the thing."
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.140]   That happens to people all the time.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.500]   Or you're pitching it and someone says to you, they ask a question, you're like, "Oh
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.500]   yeah.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.220]   Well, I'm getting to that in just a second here."
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.580]   That's a pretty good sign you've got your information in the wrong order because people
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.220]   are already having thoughts.
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.900]   Are there other signs or ways to kind of evaluate how you're doing with whatever kind of pitch
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.860]   you have, whether it's for business or something at work?
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:17.860]   I mean, it's hard because looking for the engagement, it doesn't give you what you need.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   Right?
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:23.100]   Because people pretend to be interested, they pretend to be disinterested.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.060]   It's really about what they engage with next.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.780]   Do they ask questions?
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.180]   Are the questions about what you're doing and the concept?
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.180]   Then you've got a problem.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.260]   The questions are like, "What are you doing next?
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.900]   How do you solve this problem?
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.220]   Where does this go?
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.220]   How do we deal with this?
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.220]   Is there a way this happens?"
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.940]   When there are those kinds of questions, they understand the concept.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.020]   How do you feel about rehearsing?
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.460]   Should people be practicing this a lot and with who?
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:50.060]   I do think you should practice a lot with anybody.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:56.640]   The key is you should be able to say it to anybody at any time.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.260]   You should have those four sentences pretty locked down.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.980]   And what you'll find is then you can start to color them and add to them and make them
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.820]   better and you can gauge the people that you're talking to.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.100]   If my buddy Jeff is talking about his personal training business and he's talking to another
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.260]   personal trainer, he would sort of pitch what he does a little differently, but he already
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.780]   has the language in his repertoire.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.100]   He might start with, "Oh, I'm a personal trainer.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.100]   I do this.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.100]   I do that."
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.540]   His basics are already there.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.540]   The framework structure is already there.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.740]   Everything else is like, it's good to rehearse, but I mean, have you ever heard somebody that
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:36.620]   you know they're reading or you know they've memorized it?
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.980]   It just detracts because then you're like, "Oh, right, this is rehearsed."
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.340]   And it sucks the passion out of it and it just makes it look like you're trying too
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.340]   hard.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:51.220]   And that's just like in a romantic relationship, like somebody's trying too hard.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.140]   It's just like, "Ugh, not interested."
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.700]   Yeah, my guidance has always been rehearse as much as you need so that you don't need
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.700]   notes.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   That's part one.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.900]   But then part two is, and get really comfortable with the fact that there's going to be multiple
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.500]   things you forget and it's okay.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.100]   Because if you rehearse it all and then you forget something, you get caught up and you're
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.700]   like, "Oh, there was one, a fourth point and let me go back and look."
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.220]   And I think it's better if you just roll with the three and forget the fourth point.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:24.220]   If it's important, it'll probably come back later because you don't want to be searching
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.580]   for notes in the middle of the conversation.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.180]   You talked about slides.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.340]   When people are giving presentations, you want the slides to live on their own because
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.460]   you mentioned they might get shared around, but you also don't want them to be distracting
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   when you're talking.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.340]   Do you tell people to create two different presentations?
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.340]   Yes.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.340]   100%.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   Okay.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.340]   Almost always.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.660]   Because at the end of the day, your slides that I mean, think about it.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.380]   You're giving a presentation with slides.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.340]   What do you actually want them to do, the person?
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.460]   Do you want them to read the slide, the words on there and read the information?
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.860]   Then what are you doing there?
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.380]   They're reading it.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.940]   And if you don't want them to read it, then why have it?
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:05.260]   Unless it's just a picture, you're describing it.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   Right, exactly.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.700]   So there are your two things.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.180]   You want them to read it or you don't.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.340]   If you don't want them to read it, then it better be something that accentuates what
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.340]   you're saying.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.740]   It better be bullet points, pictures, simple messages, like that simple.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:23.220]   If you put up something enough that they have to read, there's no point in having it there.
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.620]   Because if you're talking, they're not going to, what are they trying to split time on
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.580]   reading it, jumping ahead?
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.860]   It's a disaster.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.660]   People want to put slides so it looks like they've done a lot of work.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.660]   It's like, okay.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.140]   By the way, I'm not even against that sometimes.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:42.700]   Sometimes there's graphs and charts that look good, so you put it on a slide and when you're
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.120]   presenting in person, but you're not speaking to the numbers on there.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:51.180]   You're saying, we did extensive research and I will send you this in detail so you can
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:55.980]   read what this slide says, but here's the summary, right?
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.840]   As opposed to like, here's the market research response.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:07.060]   As you could see here, it's your slide should accentuate what you're saying, not trying
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.940]   to do the work for you.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.300]   One other thing that I'll share just in case anyone's making a presentation that you could
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.500]   tell me if you don't like this idea, but every time I went and gave a pitch for my company,
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:24.040]   I took notes after the fact of all the questions I was getting asked and then I took every
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.980]   question and I said, okay, this question's either going to be a question that I think
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:32.100]   everyone needs the answer to, it needs to be part of the pitch, or it's a question that
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.420]   some people might have, but not everyone, so it's not as part of the pitch, but I'm
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:42.420]   going to create a slide for the question, and it was basically, I don't know if this
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.620]   was like a psychological trick, but I found that someone would ask a question at the end
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.860]   and I would jump to a slide to answer it.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.000]   The first time, I wouldn't, and then I'd go home, I'd make the slide, and the next time
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.480]   I would jump to it, and for some reason, when it was written on the slide as if I'd thought
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:01.440]   about it in advance, people were like, oh, you can answer this, I'm not worried anymore,
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.500]   but if I off the cuff answer it, I'm just like, oh, this is what we're going to do.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.420]   People were a little more apprehensive, whether I'm, you know, the answer is just kind of
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.420]   made up.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.020]   - Exactly, it's like what I used to say when I was pitching in TV, it's all in the casting.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:17.940]   It's like, no, it's in the concept, like, if I have to tell you that we'll figure it
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.420]   out in casting, it means I really don't know how to make it work, and I'll just get good
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.540]   cast that'll fix it, right, and that's sort of the same thing, where it's like, you answer,
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.780]   you ask me a question that's even tough, and I just answer it, it's like, there's a chance
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:35.020]   that I may not believe you, and I think you just will say anything to make the pitch good.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:39.220]   - Any final tips for people, you know, obviously not pitching Hollywood and that kind of thing
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.220]   that we left off?
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.220]   - Yeah, but it's anything.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:49.260]   It is literally a guide for conversation in life, and keep it simple.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:53.900]   Probably the best exercise that seemed to work the best for people is I have them do
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.820]   my Twitter exercise, like if you had to tweet what your product or service was, and that's
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:08.140]   it, and not the new extended Twitter length, but the original 144 characters, like, what
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.580]   would you put?
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.660]   What would you say?
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:16.020]   And if you can't get it there because you think everything is so valuable and so complicated,
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.400]   you need to work harder.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.060]   It means that you're actually in more need of it, and it's just happened to me, I have
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:26.060]   a very big client, I'm very excited about their company, I've come on as an advisor,
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:30.220]   I'm really involved, it is a very in-depth company.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:37.180]   Like there are layers on layers, and you know, we are talking about it, and I just, I couldn't
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.860]   get a log line for them, because there was just so many things, oh, but we don't talk
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:45.340]   about the financing, then we don't do that, and it's like, when we finally got it, it
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.900]   was like, oh, wow, like, it was more important than we thought, right?
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.980]   Because at the beginning, you're like, oh, we got so many good things, let's just get
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:57.300]   people in a little bit, and then they'll see all the good things, and you're like, no.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.820]   Go to the Twitter thing, and can you make it that, can you make it that simple?
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.500]   How, like, sometimes with clients, I'll be like, okay, here's seven words, tell me your
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.860]   idea in seven words, that's it.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:14.100]   Which seven do you choose, right?
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:21.620]   Platform used for hailing, whatever, like, you have to put it in such a small thing,
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.220]   you're like, okay, you know, and I do that TV shows, we used to do it all the time, it's
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:33.220]   like, it's the amazing race for the smartest people in the world, like, I don't really
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.620]   know the show, but you could kind of get a basic idea, it's like, okay, then you add,
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.740]   all right, here's 10 more words, go ahead, what would you choose?
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:47.420]   And then you're adding, you know, and that's probably the best exercise, which is like,
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:52.940]   how would you actually explain it in 144 characters if you really had to?
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.220]   So people kind of understand, not necessarily they'd want to buy it, but they'd understand
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.040]   what it is you sell.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:02.620]   And that's basically trying to convey the four points of the whack whether, or just
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:03.900]   the first?
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:09.020]   If you only have 144 characters, or 15 or 25 words, just the first, it is the most important,
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.220]   what is it is the most important, how does it work is the second.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.700]   Those take up 50% of everything that you need.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.700]   All right.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.580]   And everything else people will get to.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.140]   They can't get to those two things on their own, is the only two things they can't get
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.660]   to on their own, they need you to inform them.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:28.620]   Everything else they can start to put together themselves, they can have an idea, they can
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.780]   develop it, but until they understand what it is, and how it works, you got nothing.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.440]   How much of the you know, if they can come to their own conclusions for the second half
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.200]   of your kind of pitch, at least of those steps, how much of your pitch is planned in advance
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:48.100]   versus kind of free form based on the questions people are asking and where it's going?
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.940]   I still have pretty good structure.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:57.460]   Because just because they come to the conclusion, like they may miss things.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.920]   Because they're focused in one area, which is fine, you basically want to, you know,
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.660]   you want all the details laid out the rest after the three minutes, you can have very
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:12.540]   loose, very loose, because they're already interested, they want to engage.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:18.860]   And now it's they are, they are looking for confirmation of their predetermined bias already.
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.860]   That's what they're looking for.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.860]   Now.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   Oh, I like that idea.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.580]   But do you have a path?
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.100]   Do you do this?
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.100]   Right?
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.220]   No, that's what you want.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.660]   You want them to be like, Oh, this could be good.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:34.000]   But is that a good valuation?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.460]   But how far are you from revenue?
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.300]   But like, you want that?
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.300]   Yep.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.100]   You don't get that you are fighting uphill.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.520]   Okay, I feel like I have a lot of notes.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:48.020]   I'm gonna work on my pitch that I send out to guests like you.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.500]   All kinds of people.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.580]   I want to take a quick turn.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.980]   So we talk a lot about travel on this show.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:55.180]   And last hack it up.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.180]   Yeah, hack it up.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:01.340]   Last year, you sold your house, you bought a fancy RV, you went around the country hit
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:06.660]   all 48 kind of contiguous states in six months with your wife and your two kids.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.220]   Before I before I hear more, like, would you do that again?
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:14.420]   I would be on the road right now, if it wasn't for my youngest wanting to go back to real
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.420]   school.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.420]   So I loved it.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   I loved every second of it.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.500]   I mean, I'm, I'm in a semi retirement mode anyways.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   I I've just, I didn't know America was that I didn't know was that good.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.700]   And that was the one takeaway from seeing all 48 states interacting with people every
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:32.700]   single day.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.660]   It was part of the documentary that I was making about it was like, we got to go meet
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.860]   people we got to go see people we was called, you know, dinner with America.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:44.260]   We went and just random people we met and just heard their stories and just shocked
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.500]   at how great this country is.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:53.100]   The people I know it feels like we're tearing each other apart and and there's such divide,
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.660]   except it's not really like that.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.660]   It really isn't.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.860]   It's like that in the media, it's like that on your social media feed, it's like that
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.100]   a few cities at certain times, and it's a protest.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:07.060]   But for the most part, the things that humans and Americans have in common, so outweigh
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:12.780]   the things we don't, that in the real world, like people are just, they're out doing their
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.780]   thing.
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:14.780]   They're trying to have fun.
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:15.780]   They're trying to take care of their family.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.780]   They're trying to make a better life.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   Like, people are really, really great.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.200]   So I absolutely loved it.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:26.680]   And I went from a, you know, a relatively good size house here in Los Angeles to a trailer
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.960]   for six months that was smaller than my bathroom.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.820]   So it took some getting used to, but I loved it.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:36.720]   Any places you went that were kind of unusual, and you're like, I didn't think that this
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.720]   would be a place I'd love.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.600]   I mean, I'm sure you hit some places people all know, and, you know, you don't need to
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.960]   tell people, oh, Austin's a cool city, you know, kind of thing.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:51.120]   I'd say big surprises for us were Alabama region, like Alabama, Tennessee, like that
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:56.240]   area, Oklahoma, Arkansas, like, just blew my, it was just amazing.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.240]   We had such a great time.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.240]   People were amazing.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.160]   Loved the scenery, that kind of stuff.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   That was a surprise.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.880]   And the other sort of big one for me was like Niagara Falls, like Niagara Falls was really
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.600]   fun and like a great, great day.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.320]   And so that was a surprise because I expected to be very touristy and, and it was, it just
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.360]   didn't matter because it was awesome.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:23.560]   And so, but I found that Southern hospitality and that kind of vibe, South Carolina and
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:28.320]   all that was just like, it was so heartwarming and the people were amazing and we just fell
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   in love.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.320]   How did you meet all these people?
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.560]   I think everyone I know when they're traveling loves to have the story of, oh, we met some
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.040]   locals in this place.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.680]   You said you did every day.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   Every day.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   How did you say?
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   Every single day.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.880]   How did you make that happen?
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.680]   So we picked like every day we had, you know, a few things we had to try to, you know, what
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.280]   the place was famous for, for foods.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.720]   We had to find the restaurant that sort of represented that best restaurant in the city
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.720]   kind of idea.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.760]   We had to find out what the cool adventure was, whitewater rafting or downhill mountain
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.640]   biking, or whatever a cool adventure was and what the great site would be.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.640]   What do you have to go see?
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.520]   Are you going to go see the St. Louis arch, like that kind of stuff, you know?
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.480]   So we did a lot of the touristy things that you have to see if you've never been to St.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.480]   Louis.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.480]   Like you kind of got to see the arch, that kind of stuff.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.920]   You know, rock and roll hall of fame, you know?
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.840]   So we did all those, but then while we were out doing that, we just like, our goal was
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.320]   to find someone to interact with and be like, Hey, can we take you to dinner?
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   This is what we're doing.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:27.440]   And it was all, all the time, every time, every place it happened, like, that's just
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.440]   what we did.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.440]   It was amazing.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.160]   Like, I'll give you, I'll give you a great example.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:38.600]   My kids were pulling into Kentucky, big Kentucky horse park, RV place, huge place, big round.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.760]   And you could park on the inside or you could park on the outside.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.320]   The outside has these amazing views of the vistas, right?
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.880]   And then we felt we were driving around, we found the one, you pick whatever one you want.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.920]   This is beautiful, backed right onto a park, basically a park.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.360]   We could drop our door out the back, have the deck out there.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.360]   It would be amazing.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.640]   But on the inside, it was about six RVs that were clustered together and everybody in their
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.840]   middle sort of like fire going, chatting, right?
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.560]   And then we drove around and I said to the kids, all right, well, what should we do?
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:05.560]   Should we take this spot?
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.560]   Super beautiful.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:07.840]   Would we be able to back right on the park?
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   It'd be amazing.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.000]   Or do you guys want to back into this group of people and just join in?
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.640]   And my kids were like, you know, 17 and 14 or 15 were like, yeah, let's go with the people.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   And so we backed our RV into a site that sort of backed into them.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.840]   We got everything all set up and we literally walked right over their campsite.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.560]   It was like, Hey, where are you guys from?
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.560]   That was it.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:29.560]   We're playing volleyball with them all night.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.560]   We're making dinner.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   Like that was it.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:36.160]   I, in Washington state, we're riding our electric bikes and this guy had this recumbent
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   bike.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.380]   You know, the one that you sit on and you peddle with your hands or whatever, and he's
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.380]   flying.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   Right.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.380]   We get to the stoplight place, waiting for the light to change.
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.760]   And I looked down, it's like, no, it's not a recumbent bike.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.840]   He's got no legs, no legs.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.240]   And I looked at him and I just made the joke.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.840]   I was like, oh man, you're making me look bad.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.120]   I'm on an electric bike here and you don't even have a leg.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:58.160]   Like this is, you make me look at we're laughing and the kids and what's your name?
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   He's like, Luis.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.160]   And I was like, what are you doing tonight?
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.160]   Luis?
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.160]   He's like, why do you ask?
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160]   Like, Hey, we do this thing.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.160]   You want to come to dinner?
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.860]   He's like, we'll make dinner for you.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.760]   He's like, okay.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.760]   So he came down.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.760]   Right.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.780]   And then, and so we spent the night with him and, and it was just, we met people from all
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.800]   four corners of the country.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.600]   Every race, creed, religion, every style, just was amazing.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.440]   It was the greatest experience of my life.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.840]   Best thing my kids ever have ever done for them.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   That's amazing.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.520]   Had you traveled a lot with your kids before?
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   We do a lot of adventures.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.640]   Like I run an adventure club, nonprofit for, so I do a lot of adventure stuff.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.360]   So the kids are not unused to doing weird kooky things like my daughter and I rappel
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.080]   down waterfalls, like silly things like that, but we'd never, but we're not campers.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.160]   We're not RV people would, you know, that's just not our world.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.040]   So this was all sort of new in that sense from, and we'd never been away for longer
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.960]   than a week or two ever.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   That's amazing.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.840]   Are the lists of all the, we had to find the best place here and do this thing.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   Is that published anywhere?
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   Or will it be?
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   I got, I have all that.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840]   I haven't published it all yet.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.800]   I'm in the middle of trying to finalize it all where we went, what we did, who we saw,
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   like all that stuff.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.800]   I have all that stuff.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   But it's coming up.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.800]   It'll be somewhere.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   It'll be coming.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800]   Awesome.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   It's a book.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   I'm going to be, it's like a coffee table book.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   It's coming out, hopefully for September.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.360]   And it's basically, it's called what I learned about America.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.760]   We jumped quickly to something totally different.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.440]   So first off, thanks for all of that.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.840]   I really enjoyed the conversation.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.900]   I think people are going to want to hear all these tips because we normally end every episode
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.240]   asking people find a place, what do you suggest they eat, do, you know, have a drink?
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.680]   Where do they go?
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:40.040]   I'll let you punt on 48 state answer for the book.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.520]   But I'm curious if there's one place that, you know, whether it was on your trip or where
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.280]   or in LA that you have some recommendations for people maybe traveling there, I don't
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   know this summer.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   I mean, I think one of the best spots that I've still can't get over is still Whistler,
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.120]   British Columbia.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.240]   It's like one of my favorite spots in the world.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.480]   There's in the summer, winter, everything looks like, well, so all the places are great.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:11.600]   But in the summer is a unique experience because it's like being in the middle of the wilderness,
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.240]   but with all the trappings of everything, which is just really, really cool.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.160]   So that's where I would say if you if you've never been there, that'd be the place I would
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   go.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.440]   But if you're in LA and you want great sushi, that's a whole other thing.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.600]   I will second your Whistler, I went on a bachelor party in Whistler and I will encourage anyone
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.360]   going there to try their mountain biking trails, which are out of this world, like, you know,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.400]   like I felt like I was biking through an Ewok village with these like elevated ramps.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.240]   And it's so smooth and just non stop.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.680]   You're like, wow, one person did break their leg.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.800]   So for him, it was not as smooth.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.480]   But for the rest of us, we had a good time.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.720]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.280]   Can people stay on top of everything you're doing and find out when this book's coming
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   out?
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.840]   I'm easy to find on my socials at Brant Penvidic, you can go to three minute rule calm and see
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.560]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.400]   My travel club, you can visit that reject average calm.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.760]   I'm pretty easy to find.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   I don't have a lot going.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.760]   I mean, I have a lot going on.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.640]   I just don't have a lot going on.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.640]   I don't.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   I don't sell anything.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.640]   I don't have a course.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.920]   I'm not trying to get people's money.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.480]   I don't take on new clients right now.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   Like, I'm just doing my thing.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.560]   I love helping people.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.520]   I love helping people find the value in their message.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.360]   It's like one of those things I've had fortune 500 CEOs like in almost tears because the
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.520]   thing they've been working on for years is finally they're finally able to explain it
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520]   properly.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.360]   And it's like the frustration of having something that you really believe in that you love,
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.600]   and you can't get people to understand it or believe in it is is overwhelming.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.040]   And it's just like, it's kind of great to be able to help people do that.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.040]   So why appreciate it.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040]   Absolutely, buddy.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040]   Thanks for being here.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.040]   Right on, man.
