[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Let's learn how to get started with WNB using PyTorch Geometric in less than a minute.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   I'm Chris Van Pelt, co-founder of Weights & Biases.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.600]   First, install WNB.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.600]   Now, let's import our Python client, WANDB, PyTorch, and PyTorch Geometric.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.000]   Next up, we'll initialize a new Weights & Biases run along with some hyperparameters for this specific experiment.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   After that, let's set up our PyTorch model with PyTorch Geometric graph convolution layers
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and reference WNB.config so that we can reproduce this sweet experiment in the future.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Lastly, let's define our training loop and use WNB.log to track our training loss for each epoch.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   The coolest part? Logging your favorite graph visualization is as easy as adding one line.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   That's it. Seriously.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Now you can see the metrics and graph visualizations flowing into your interactive dashboard
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   and your hyperparameters in the runs table.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   For the best experience, sign up for an account at wnb.me/signup.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   (upbeat music)
