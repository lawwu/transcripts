[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Adler and Van Doren suggest that the first and most important rule of skillful reading,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.040]   active reading, is asking questions and trying to answer them.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.640]   And that really, if you just dwell on that and dwell on, well, what kinds of questions
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.320]   should I be asking and how should I go about asking them, how should I go about answering
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.000]   them when the author isn't present, and so on and so forth, then you'll get very far.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   And they also say, conversely, and this isn't meant as a criticism, an undemanding reader
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.440]   asks no questions and gets no answers.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.320]   And I certainly have read many, many books that way, particularly before I developed
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.920]   this habit.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.000]   And I often found myself falling into that second category of the issue was not that
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.160]   I failed to remember things, but rather that my eyes just kind of skidded across paragraphs
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.280]   without even realizing it.
