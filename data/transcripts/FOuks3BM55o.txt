[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   You want to run a marathon at 57 years old?
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.480]   52 51 to 52.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'll be honest, I miss you. Can you come back to the United States, please? I know.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.440]   I miss you too. I mean, the poker game can't by definition be as much fun if I'm not there.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.760]   It plays at bigger states, and it's more challenging, but it's not as much fun.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.600]   There's not as much laughing. What's on the menu tonight for austerity 2023?
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.680]   The Amuse Bouche is a Madeline with like a terrain of foie gras.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.640]   Fantastic.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.000]   In honor of freeburg.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.560]   And then rutabaga rutabaga salad, and then some duck thing, duck breast,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   you know, I love duck. And then and then butterscotch panna cotta.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.960]   Wow, that is great lineup. And you know what, I like the idea. We're doing some poultry.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960]   Chef Sean is firing on all cylinders these days.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.800]   I feel feels very like engaged. He was very engaged. Yeah, he's kind of going for it.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.440]   He's been on.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   Yeah, that was quite nice. The other day, Brad, because it's austerity measures.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.680]   We had this incredible dish, and we're eating it. And then he said,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.520]   caviar is on the bottom. And I was like, oh, so we just we don't put the caviar on top.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.040]   They just put it on the bottom. The markets down.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.160]   That's my style. Austerity.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.000]   I'm not lying. Am I like, Oh, my God.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.720]   No, he did say, guys, the caviar is on the bottom, not the top.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.200]   This is
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.720]   all right, Saks is here, everybody. So that means we have a quorum.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.720]   Hopefully, the Sultan of science, who is on Wall Street today,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.680]   taking a company public. So congrats to our bestie Friedberg.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.640]   Ding, ding.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   He couldn't make it. He's at a dinner. So with us, the fifth beetle, as it were,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.240]   Brad Gerstner is here to talk all things macro. Welcome back to the pod. How's life been?
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.680]   Good to be back. A little domo arigato to you, Jason, as you eat your way through Japan.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.880]   Yes, I am on my culinary tour. I'll be back
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.720]   Sunday. But I am having the time of my life here. Are you running AdWords on your food blog?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   That's what it's come back to. I'm back to the weblog zinc days. I'm just trying to make
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.360]   $2,600 a day.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   I noticed your tick tock got 22 likes.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.240]   Yeah, you know, I'm trying to figure out tick tock. I'm gonna be right as they shut it down.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.600]   That's when I'll figure it out.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.480]   Will that rapture buy you another Japanese pancake or not?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.840]   Those pancakes, man, are next level. The fluffy pancakes here. Everything actually with the
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.760]   exchange rate coming to Japan is so affordable. It's nuts. And this is a crazy week because it's
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.920]   the it's the Tokyo Marathon, but everything is so affordable. The people are amazing.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.040]   It's the best country to visit in the world. I think, for me, it's Italy, Spain, I mean,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.360]   Italy's right there too. But I would say Japan is like, it's definitely top two or three.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.480]   What do you love about it?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.880]   Best food. You know, I went there I took the I took the kids like five years ago,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.640]   the older three at the time. But they were younger. And you know, there's there's a negative
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.160]   birth rate in Japan. And so number one, when you have any kid, but frankly, multiple kids,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.600]   the the Japanese embrace you with so much love because they love seeing these big families.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.120]   Yeah, they're unbelievably kind. We went to Kyoto, did the professor's walk, saw the cherry
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.440]   blossom festival, basically ate our way through Japan. That was my that was my only vacation trip
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.000]   I did. I've done like 10 or 12 trips for work. Once we I went with Reid Hoffman, and Reid set
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   up this thing where we went through all these different parts of Tokyo and ate at this incredible
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.880]   sushi place. You have to go with somebody who can dial it in. Yes. And have all the hookups.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.640]   Brad, you spend much time in Tokyo and Japan?
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.120]   I haven't. I've been there only twice. And that was when I was poor. And I stayed in a really
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.800]   small room and ate really shitty food.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.120]   All right. So you're saying in 20 in 2022, when you became Oregon?
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.400]   Okay, great.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.240]   He's like, we have rooms. He's like, it's our hostel. All right. And with us, of course,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.320]   the next department, what cabinet position you're going for sacks? Which we wish we start floating
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.360]   here. Oh, my God. Here you are with the disinformation starting already. It's a
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.080]   compliment. Secretary of SAS is with us. DeSantis had a pretty great article on
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.320]   the Wall Street Journal. Really? I didn't saw one.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.360]   When they revoked the special administrative status for Disney, he wrote an article,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   I think it was Wednesday, Tuesday or Wednesday in the Wall Street Op Ed.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.720]   What was his premise that they was a corporate or as a culture
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.440]   that wokeism is basically modern Marxism, and we have to defeat it. This is his language, not mine,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:58.400]   at every turn. And Disney needs to just be business people and not feed the vocal minorities inside of
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.280]   their company, like every other company should they should be subject to shareholder concerns
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   that apply to the majority of shareholders. Well, I think this is why I think DeSantis is
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.280]   doing well with the Republican base. And you know, if you see polling of the Republican primary is
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.400]   he understands that it's not good enough just to have this sort of Reagan s totally hands off
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.080]   government approach. Because the radical left is advancing its agenda, not just legislatively, but
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.200]   through corporations through ESG, really through taking over key private sector institutions. And
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.960]   so he's willing to use government to push back on that agenda on behalf of parents or on behalf of,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.480]   you know, what he sees as the majority of the country. And so it's a very different approach
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.800]   than you know, the Republican Party would have been 30 or 40 years ago. This is why, you know,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.520]   in the parlance of the base, he understands what time it is. And what's required here is not again,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.760]   this totally laser fair approach, but rather, a much more energetic, aggressive approach
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.120]   towards checking these bad ideas wherever they come from.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.880]   It's not the only one. I don't know if you saw this week, Bill Maher went on a bit of a press
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.600]   tour, and he was on with Jake Tapper. And he made a very interesting, I think, point about
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.720]   liberalism versus woke ism. And it was quite articulate. You know, he's a pretty good observer
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   of culture. He said, they're kind of casting out the liberals in the party for this woke ism and
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.880]   the intolerant nature of the woke movement versus the liberal movement specifically,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.680]   under the lens of trans rights. But let's put that aside for now. We got a full
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   docket before we get into the culture wars and presidential elections. Let's start
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.800]   with we'll go private markets to public markets. Because they obviously dovetail so nicely.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.640]   Item one on the docket today, there is just a massive AI FOMO frenzy going on.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.960]   economists published a piece this week about the insane fundraising in the generative AI space.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.320]   This is stuff like chat GPT, stable diffusion, you've heard these names. And there are now 500
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.480]   generative AI startups, according to this report that tracks with what I'm seeing in the early
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.680]   stage and not counting the open AI 10 Billy from Microsoft investment donation, rev share round
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.320]   trip, whatever that is. They have so far collectively raised more than $11 billion.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.120]   The article included this chart, which you can see if you're on our YouTube channel,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:35.440]   and just tons of folks working in audio image, and text. So we're basically looking at the
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.400]   multimedia basically revolution of PCs in the 90s occurring again, and a complete platform
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.880]   platform shift. Doug Leoni from Sequoia, one of the greatest investors in history of Silicon Valley
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.440]   had this to say, and we will comment on the other side of this 52nd clip from Doug.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.720]   I actually think that AI is the next platform shift, in the same way that mobile was the one
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.560]   before internet was the one before. So I think AI is real. But I said earlier, we're going to
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   overestimate it in the short term, we're going to invest in everything in the same way that in 1999,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.320]   we invested in everything. But then Google came out of that, or Facebook came out of that. So I
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.240]   think you have to have a good head on your shoulder, where you don't practice FOMO, where you
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.360]   don't chase every company, AI is real, AI is the next platform. But how do we not invest in everything
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:38.480]   that works? How do we make certain investments based on market maps based on thought processes
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.760]   that are more rational, and not do every investment just because every other venture
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.920]   firm is doing everything best. All right, Chamath, what do you think of this massive influx?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.280]   I think it's important to think about what the incentives are, as Charlie Munger says,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.320]   show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome. I posted it into our group chat credits,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.120]   we sent all their private banking customers an offer, they are now offering 6.5% for a three
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:16.960]   month T bill 6.5%. And if you go back to what we talked about before, when the risk free rate is
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.840]   somewhere north of five or five and a half percent, and banks are willing to give you
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.640]   six and a half percent in the short term, you have to generate more than three times that
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.320]   to make an investment make sense when you're investing in the long term.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.800]   So three month money is going to pay you six and a half or seven. If you're going to invest for 10,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.160]   15 years, which is what you need to do typically for a startup, you need to get 20 to 25%.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.880]   So there's going to be a lot of pressure for venture investors to put the money to work.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.080]   Because otherwise, their LPs, their limited partners, the people that give them the money,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.520]   will have this attitude that goes somewhere along the following lines, okay, I've committed to you,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   why aren't you investing? Because otherwise, I can get paid six and a half percent on the front end.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.160]   And so this is becoming very problematic. What am I paying you for? What am I paying you 2% a year
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.600]   in management fee for? So I think what happens, unfortunately, is the opposite of what Doug says,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   I think good investors will try to follow Doug's feedback and advice. And the ones that have a
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.080]   track record of distributions of DPI can do more of it than not. But I think most people will be
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   under pressure to deploy the capital. And so the 500 odd companies, Jason, you mentioned,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.200]   will get a lot of it, and it'll get torched, because most of them probably won't amount to
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.400]   much of anything in the short term, you will create way too much correlation. And you will
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.200]   have zero time diversity, which as we've learned, is a recipe for terrible returns.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.560]   Time diversity being Hey, you deployed all this web to capital web three capital, sorry, crypto,
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.360]   whatever, in this very short period of time, you overpaid, you know, fire, literally on fire,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.200]   Brad, when you hear Chamath talk about the 6.5%, and then you look at private markets, you invest
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.720]   across the lifecycle of companies, obviously, you're in some private companies, we all know
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.160]   very well, famously, snowflake, I think your biggest win ever, correct me if I'm wrong. And
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:23.120]   in terms of a private, how do you look at this? When you're a steward of capital, public markets,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.680]   private markets, and then just YOLO, just put it into, you know, some charity bills, or,
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.120]   yeah, bonds or whatever. I mean, first, let's just frame, right, the chart that you showed,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.680]   I think you should it said, you know, x open AI, I don't know, something like 10 or $11 billion
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.320]   have been invested into some 500 AI companies. I mean, I happen to agree with Doug that this is a
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.800]   platform shift on the same magnitude as the internet or mobile itself. In fact, it may be
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   bigger than both of those. But, you know, when I look at 10 or $11 billion, you know, let's put it
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:08.400]   in context, meta is going to spend 20 billion in one year alone on AR VR. And this is on an entire
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:17.280]   platform. So I don't know, I, I think whenever you have something as tectonic as mobile or internet,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.480]   it deserves a lot of investment. And yes, it's going to be messy. And yes, Chamath's right,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.920]   the cost of capital, frankly, is limiting the amount of money going into these businesses
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.760]   already. So we see a lot of dry powder sitting on the sideline, this chasing new ideas.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:41.200]   I think one way one way to frame it as well as I think about in 2000, we all knew that the internet
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.360]   was going to be big, we may have been lucky enough to conclude that search was going to be big.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:53.680]   But if you invest in in Yahoo, or Infoseek, or AOL, or excite, like, you tore all that money went
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.680]   to zero. Right. So now think about just these large language models, right, the foundation
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:05.040]   models, which are driving and enabling all of it, open AI, you've got open AI, you got a drop,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.920]   like you got co here, you got character, you got stability, you've got lambda,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.680]   it is almost impossible to know with any certainty, much like it was with the search
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.440]   engines in 99 2000, who's going to emerge where the value capture is going to be, it may all end
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.320]   up with Microsoft and Google. I mean, this may end up looking like iOS and Android at the foundation
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   model level. And so, you know, I think as investors, for example, on the foundation model side,
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.000]   I think it's very difficult to choose just one, particularly when the largest one is frankly
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.600]   captive and a proxy to Microsoft, and they're capping your upside return. So like, those are
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.680]   difficult investment decisions. That doesn't detract from the fact that I think it is as big
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.600]   as Doug suggests. And I do think there are going to be applications and tooling layer to come out
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.640]   of this, it's going to produce really big winners, I would say that we are spending an extraordinary
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.400]   amount of time. In this space, we haven't made a lot of investments, I think you have to study,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.040]   you have to get deep. I mean, Chamath, certainly, and I have been investing in this space for at
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:19.440]   least a decade, maybe 15 years. But don't underestimate that the transformer model really
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.320]   did change the game here. And we're now producing impacts much larger.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.240]   Saks, last week, you said, lab three and crypto didn't kind of stick with you, you didn't see the
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:38.960]   use cases. And you in the first inning here, or first at bat, you rattled off three or four really
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.160]   compelling use cases from summaries to you know, the the assistant guide on your side concept.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.840]   Is this a Ken in your mind, because Brad just said it could be bigger than mobile,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.520]   internet, mobile, AI revolution, if you were to look at those three, do you think it's bigger
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.600]   than actually mobile, and then we'll get into return profiles of 6.5% on cash versus what are
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.560]   VCs going to be able to do in this kind of market? Yeah, I mean, so I agree with Brad and Doug that
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.520]   this is the next big platform shift, whether it's as big as mobile, or it's more like social or
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.600]   cloud. I mean, those have been the big platform shifts over the last decade or two. And I think
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.040]   this is definitely on par with those. I think Brad's right, we don't know where the value
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.440]   capture is going to be, maybe it just all ends up accreting to the big companies who can make
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.120]   massive investments in this space. You know, one difference between the internet ecosystem today
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.000]   and 20 years ago is you do have these giant companies who are not totally incompetent,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.200]   right? I mean, they do have lots of talented engineers. And, you know, like 20 years ago,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.840]   you'd have the big companies would just sit on their hands in the face of a platform shift,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.040]   and they'd just be sitting ducks who get disrupted. That's not going to happen today.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.600]   That being said, I do think that any new platform shift creates opportunities for startups. And it
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.960]   may not be efficient the way that these opportunities get pursued in the sense that,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.720]   yeah, Doug's right, that there's going to be a lot of spray and pray. But I think that it is
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   kind of efficient for the ecosystem as a whole, right? Because like any smart engineer with a
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.640]   half decent idea ends up getting funded. And out of all of that, you get kind of a
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:22.240]   pre-Cambrian explosion where, you know, the ecosystem evolves a lot of different
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.320]   types of businesses. Most of them don't work, they get wiped out, they go extinct, but
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.960]   there'll be some good things that get funded. So we're more like, I think, Doug and how we see it,
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.760]   we don't want to spray and pray, we want to be very selective. We want to put more money behind
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.520]   fewer opportunities that we think are better. And Doug Leone, you know, I think he generally gives
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.720]   good advice of the tough love variety. And this is of a piece with that. And so I agree with him.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.080]   That being said, there is a certain value to the ecosystem and having all these seed funds
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.840]   to spray and pray, right? Because this gets a lot of plants, a lot of flowers, and then you see
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.520]   what blooms. I would say, yeah, to build on that, Saks, this is a perfect inefficiency.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.120]   You know, when you see it from the outside, you're like, well, this is super inefficient.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.360]   Why so many companies, if you free your mind and just say their experiments, two or three person
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.160]   experiments, 500k to a million and a half in that first stage, when I invest right before you do
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.720]   when you do your series is at five or 10 million. Milestone based funding is back in the tech
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.720]   industry. And that was something, Chamath, that we lost for a little while there, people would
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.920]   just come out and they would raise a series B out of the gate, no product market fit, etc. Now what
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.960]   we're seeing is people are raising that 12 to 18 months, they got their backs up against the wall.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.400]   Speaking of tough love, which you referenced Saks, that tough love of Hey, you have to hit the next
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.360]   milestone. What did you accomplish with the 1.5 million in order to get the 10 million in order
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.880]   to get the 30 million that 500 is going to go 10x, there'll be 5000 of these startups, but it'll
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.760]   quickly whittle down when it's your mouth as people go through this milestone based funding
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.600]   system in Silicon Valley,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.320]   we haven't given enough time for a logical framework of investing to develop, which also
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.480]   is tied to a logical framework for entrepreneurship to emerge. We're just way, way, way too early.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.120]   So the thing with all of these language models is that they are grist for the mill. And we talked
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:22.480]   about this before, if it was a highly proprietary asset, you would have never sold 49% of it to
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.040]   Microsoft for $10 billion, because you would assume that it was worth a trillion dollars.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   So it's a huge tell on the part of open AI, their deep understanding, and they understand it better
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.880]   than anybody else, that it's a bit of a capped upside. So what is uncapped, I guess, is maybe
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:45.920]   the better question. Well, if you look at the 1849 gold rush, as an example, the people panning for
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.880]   gold, in my opinion, are the people building language models today. They're going to come
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   and they're going to go but who's going to win? Well, the pick and shovel providers one,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.960]   Levi Strauss one. So what is the equivalent of that today? I think it's at the silicon layer,
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.400]   because you need to really re architect how compute will actually work in a world of all
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.120]   of these models, those folks will get paid. If you look at AMD and Nvidia, they've been getting
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   paid for years, they continue to get paid, they probably will continue to get paid even more.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.520]   And so folks that actually take a step into doing something hard and difficult in AI, like
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.080]   custom silicon could get rewarded. And then there's what I call the white truffles.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:36.800]   What are these unique Alba white truffles, these singular sources of data that when used
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:44.880]   in reinforcement learning, make your output, just zinc. And that's where I think
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:51.120]   Facebook is an obvious white truffle core as a white truffle, but there are a lot of startups
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.600]   that could become white truffles, if they gather enough data. And that's like a pretty reasonable
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:03.920]   framework. And so in that framework, if you apply it to today, there's way few silicon startups,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.280]   and there's way few white truffles. Instead, it's everything is the baloney in the middle,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.680]   which is random people talking about some random model that's just going to again, become
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.360]   highly commoditized. You have to remember, all these models are open source, then none of them
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.720]   mean anything in the absence of the data you give it to train on 100% Brad, hey, okay.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.360]   Well, I want to add one other piece of news that we saw this week, which is open AI announced that
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.320]   its developer AI, they were cutting the tax on that are basically the metered rate they charge
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:40.240]   to use it by 90%. So I think this is gonna be a game changer. I think this is based on the
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.400]   chat GPT 3.5 API. And of course, you're coming out with 4.0. Later this year, I've already had
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.960]   explained to the audience what an API is and why this is important. And for those people who don't
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.000]   know, this application programming interface, it allows a developer of some other application to
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.080]   build on top of you. So in other words, like a developer wouldn't have to use this chat interface
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.200]   to get access to the large language model, you could just submit your request through the API.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.840]   And so give an example of what of like a popular app and how they might use it. Yeah. So yeah. So
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.800]   I think like notion actually had a demo that they published where it was a pretty incredible demo,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:26.640]   maybe we can find it and it would do things they added actions in the demo, like generate a task
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.400]   list. So you could take like a document or a meeting summary, and would spit out recommendations
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.240]   for next steps or tasks, it could, you know, spit out a table. Basically, it's the autocomplete for
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.880]   everything that we talked about, right. So now notion doesn't need to build their own LLM
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.720]   expertise, they just don't use the API. So when the notion app, you say, Hey, I'm building a
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.720]   marketing plan, and you say, Well, okay, give me a list of things that should be on my marketing
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.800]   plan for my new app. It sends a signal to the chat GPT API, which will be on Azure Microsoft's
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.520]   platform. And then it gives you the data back, you don't have to build the language model.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.480]   Yeah, incredibly powerful notion has all the content that they need, but they don't have the
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.320]   AI expertise. Now they don't have to generate your create AI expertise in house, they just use the
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.280]   API. I wonder really powerful. And but just to finish the thought here, I think that one of the
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.400]   things that's probably misleading about these stats around funding and the there's like almost
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.360]   600 startups already, there are AI startups, is that, you know, what happens when there's a new
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.320]   wave is that founders are smart, right? And they know how to market themselves in the way that is
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.120]   most compelling to VCs. And they know that like VCs, frankly, are a little bit lemming like in
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.160]   terms of their migration to the next wave and wanting to glom on to the next big wave. So
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:49.360]   VCs are now looking for AI. If you're a founder, and you're you build one feature on top of the,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.640]   you know, open AI API, now all of a sudden, you're going to market yourself as a AI company,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.360]   you're not gonna market yourself as just a SaaS company.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.000]   And so that's valid. Yeah, I mean, it could be gamed, or it could be like a great pivot,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.480]   you know,
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.960]   yeah, and it's not it's not totally one or the other. I mean, it's just that if you have a
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.160]   plausible connection to AI as a founder, you're going to start marketing yourself as an AI company.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.120]   And so that's how all of a sudden, you can have 600 of these companies, you know, that are all
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.320]   of a sudden out there in the wake of this sort of chat GPT is I think a lot of companies are
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.280]   recategorizing themselves. I literally had this experience, not three weeks ago, right before I
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.640]   went to Japan, serial founder and team that we've backed for that had an exit, said, Can I show you
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:42.160]   something? I said, Yeah, got on the zoom showed me a little proof of concept using chat GPT. And
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.400]   he said, This is my idea. This is the vertical. And I just said, Okay, what do you want? He said,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.680]   500k for 10%. I said, Okay, done. Great, let's learn. And it's an easy bet for us to make,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.920]   because we know it's a serial team. For open AI, the way that it could become a trillion dollar
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.520]   company is actually by cutting the cost to such a low degree that nobody else can effectively
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.680]   compete with it. And then at that point, they can become a small, small, small tax,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.440]   you'd rather just pay it than try to compete with it. And I think for open AI, that's actually a
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.840]   very brilliant strategy. So that's how they, they could get to become very, very large in valuation
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.760]   would be to become so pervasively relied upon, and where they take such a minuscule take rate
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.880]   of their participation in you building a company that could be really effective for them like cloud
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.400]   computing, right? Like we're going to just take such a small tax. Yeah, that's not a small tax.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.720]   That's a large tax. That's the picks and shovels play in a way to create the developer ecosystem
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.240]   for AI and to your point, I mean, I think you raise a good point that you know, what was their
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.720]   motivation to take such a dilutive round, you know, the 10 billion that was evaluation at 3030.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.000]   Yeah. And does that imply that they're not confident? I mean, that the flip side of it
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.840]   could be maybe they know, they want to compete on the basis of rapidly, you know, becoming the
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.560]   developer platform. And so they're going to subsidize that developer platform, you know,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.240]   with negative gross margins for some period of time. And maybe that's why they need a lot of
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.360]   capital. And they were in kind of a reflexive loop of just cost of getting better versus the
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.680]   amount of money they had to get better. And so maybe they were forced to do it. And then in that
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.560]   point, how would you justify you would say, well, the other 50% is still hugely valuable. So that's
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.120]   enough for us. And I think that that's, that's very logical as well. Brad, you have your finger
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.520]   on the pulse of LPS, limited partners who back funds like Chamath, Saks is mine and yours.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:37.120]   We heard 6.5% on your money for no risk. Well, you in Chamath's position is hey,
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.280]   you have to triple that if you want to be a private market investor. That's about 20%.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.360]   20% rule of 72. That means every three and a half years, you got to double.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.680]   If you're doing that for a 10 year fund, you're looking at a five x fund is kind of table stakes
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.320]   then I think just back of the envelope math. What are LPS thinking right now? Are they looking at
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.560]   this world and saying I should just be all in cash? Or are they saying, yeah, everybody thinks
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   we should be all be in cash. Therefore, there's not going to be enough money in private. Therefore,
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.920]   there's an opportunity there. We know the 6.5% rate. You know, that's not going to be here
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.480]   forever. It may be here for a little while, but we need to we need to keep investing in venture.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.560]   Or are they just cutthroat about it? Like, let's pause venture investing, private market investing?
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.680]   It's a great question. First, when I look at the three year Treasury bill, it's like 4.7.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.840]   Not to quibble here. So I think Chamas getting a little goosy, goosy on the 6.5.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.720]   But the fact of the matter is, what does that mean? Goosy, goosy?
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:38.160]   You're super special. You're VIP JP.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.680]   Maybe there's like some sort of like, bond rate that included corporates or something.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.840]   Maybe it was 5.2 from Robin Hood on my Robin Hood account for J trading. So
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.760]   it's right. What is in that? What is in that Jason, they probably got some junk bonds and
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.480]   they're ripping you off. Whatever it is, I'm getting five points. It's so great. You are
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.320]   until you're not you are until you're not. It's 100% T bill, print season and junk bond fund.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.520]   Look at the fine print, Jacob.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.080]   You know, LPs have a 10 year view. They understand like most people. I mean,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:19.120]   listen, if you look out at the 10 year, the reason the 10 year is, you know, that we have real
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.520]   interest rates at about one and a half percent. So that's the 10 year less expected inflation.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.800]   When you look out is because people expect inflation to come down and they expect rates
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.720]   to come down. So if you were an LP and you said I'm not going to invest in venture in the next
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.000]   two vintages, which may be the best two vintages we've seen in a long time because prices are
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.600]   adjusting, etc. And I'm going to move it all into some rate bet. First, it's just very difficult to
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:52.240]   do. They don't move their allocations around that quickly. Now, a wealthy family as an LP could move
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.040]   their allocations around really quickly. But if you're Texas or you're Ohio, or you're a sovereign
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.720]   wealth fund, you're betting on the arc of value creation. I would say this, the consequence is
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.760]   they're narrowing their aperture as to the venture funds they want to allocate capital.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.600]   Okay, explain that unpack who they are narrowing the aperture to.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:17.280]   We've talked a lot on this pod about the power law. And the truth of the matter is whether we're
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:23.600]   talking about AI or software, or anything else that you know, people are going to be funding,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.720]   it's 10% of the investments that are going to yield 90% of the returns. And so
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.480]   they're looking at that and saying, Who are the top 10 firms in Silicon Valley,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.560]   I either want to get allocation to those firms who are seeing the best deals converting the best
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.680]   deals and are selective, like Saks talked about, or we just don't want to allocate. So I think,
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.160]   you know, what we saw over the last two years, Jason was an explosion of new funds,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:55.120]   an explosion of new, you know, first time second time funds. I think subscale small funds,
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:02.960]   with no DPI, they're going to find a really, really tough time to Chamas point about DPI
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.800]   raising capital. Okay, to see the scale player scale. So part of that is clearing out the
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:15.520]   inventory from the last cycle. Two news stories this week about companies, you know, maybe
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.720]   struggling. Sequoia got off the board of citizen if you don't know citizen, that's that app that
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.840]   tells you where crimes are happening in your city. Very popular in San Francisco. It's literally
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   goes off every 90 seconds. It's pretty dystopian. That company citizen, which is a pretty cool app
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:38.080]   has raised 130 million to date Sequoia led the series a in 2017. They did a pay to play around
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.160]   if you don't know what that is. Basically, if you don't invest, you get crammed down,
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.160]   how does the cram down work? Well, your shares in the company went down 10 to one.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:52.480]   And you probably got moved to common shares as a part of as opposed to preferred, which has a
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.920]   series of protections, they get their money out first, yada, yada. But Sequoia refused to
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.720]   participate according to this FT story. Again, Sequoia did not comment on this. It's it's kind
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.360]   of something you don't do as a VC when something goes bad at a company and you leave the board.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.280]   You generally don't want to say bad things or taint the company any more than leaving the board
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:21.440]   does. So a bunch of cram downs happening and then dovetailing with that Instacart according to the
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.840]   Wall Street Journal had a big Q4 as it prepares to go public. Instacart. If you remember, we talked
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:35.520]   about it on the show cut its internal valuation 75% last year from 39 billion to 10 billion.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.920]   According to sources, Instacart Q4 results, according to the Wall Street Journal, up more
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.760]   than 50% even though order volume grew only 16% why they turned advertising on the app just like
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:54.080]   Uber and Amazon, a lot of these commerce folks, folks are building ad business inside of theirs.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.280]   So what do you think about what's happening as we clear out this private? Anybody have thoughts
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   on Instacart or the cram down rounds? Go either way with this, and then we'll go to
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.120]   I wouldn't focus too much on those two companies. I think we're going to see in the second half of
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   23. And all of 24 is a lot of medicine being taken a lot of down rounds, a lot of structure
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.640]   is going to be a tale of two cities, the hot area, you know, AI is going to continue to receive new
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.560]   investment. And all these companies that, you know, that receive peak valuations in 2021,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.840]   are going to have a day of reckoning either, you know, if they're lucky, maybe they have a flat
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.480]   round or model modestly up round, but a lot of them are going to have down rounds or restructurings.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.680]   And this is going to be going on for the next year and a half.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.520]   What's your philosophy, Saxon, leaving a board, this is a really dicey issue when you give up
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.480]   on a company. What's the best practice there? How do you do it without damaging the company?
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.360]   Obviously, the founder relationships can be hard. What have you learned about this as a private
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.760]   market? Well, I think, I think that sometimes we like flip board members internally at craft just
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.520]   because people have different amounts of capacity. That's not a statement at all about the way craft
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.320]   feels about the company is just a reflection of our individual bandwidth, or whose expertise are
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.280]   needed at a time. But when the firm itself quits a board, I think there's no way to read that other
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.440]   than, you know, a statement of protest. And I don't know what happened with that company. But
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:26.800]   it seems to me that, you know, again, it could be a sign that the venture firm isn't happy with the
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.880]   way that they're being treated. The cram down, Chama. That's, that's a bitter pill to swallow.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.640]   Why would founders do this cram down instead of just adding a little more to the top? And is there
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:44.320]   a way to do this without, you know, going scorched earth or poisoning the well as it were?
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:51.440]   We, again, putting this app and Sequoia aside, this is happening all over the ecosystem. So is
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.920]   there a way to do this gracefully? Or is it just going to be messy?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:02.240]   I think it's going to be really messy. I mean, to state the obvious, no, no venture capital investor
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.360]   ever quits the board voluntarily of a great company that's doing well, that would be dumb.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.680]   So as David said, sort of like the proof is in the pudding there. And at the same time,
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:25.360]   there are a lot of companies who don't want to see the writing on the wall, and will do all kinds of
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:34.240]   gymnastics to try to stick a landing on a contorted financing. And sometimes those things have real
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.800]   consequences to other investors who just don't think it's the right thing to do. I wouldn't read
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:45.520]   too much into this, except that good founders have a responsibility to do what's right for
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.680]   themselves and their employees. Nobody else. And the thing to keep in mind investors really,
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.720]   no, I think you I think you absolutely have to prioritize the people doing the actual work.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.840]   And if and if you actually did prioritize them, what you would probably say to yourself is,
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.960]   oh, my gosh, there are people who I work with, who I look in the eye every day,
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.240]   because investors, you'll see once a quarter. But I have my fellow employees that I'm as a founder,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.840]   that I look in the eyes every day, who've been toiling with me for umpteen hours a day,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:23.280]   every day for years. And they are now totally underwater. What is the right thing to do for
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.880]   them? And I think if you just answer that question, you wouldn't do all these contorted things,
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.800]   you would just reset the valuation, you would refresh the equity pool,
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.360]   you would issue options back out to those employees, and you would move on.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.160]   It's all these other things that get in the way of answering that simple,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.400]   simple question, where people fuck it up.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.640]   And I've done that before.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.560]   You sacked if you don't have a team, and you don't have a motivated team, you have nothing.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.040]   I've done that before. I don't want to rehash one of my more miserable experiences. But I was
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.520]   dealing with a company that had a grossly inflated valuation, it was a total problem case.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.080]   We voluntarily slashed the valuation in half and reissued options to the employees
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.120]   to keep them motivated.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.000]   No big deal.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.440]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.280]   And it's not that it's no big deal, but it requires some amount of fortitude.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.560]   And like, you know, understanding your priorities, I guess.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.800]   But you're about to what do you think, you know, like, first, I think it's revealing
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:29.040]   that we think what happened here is so out of the ordinary. I mean, you flashback to 2001 to 2004.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.560]   Sequoia, I don't think funded a single loser in their portfolio.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.440]   Right? Like, that's a time where you walked away from the ones that weren't winning.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.400]   And you fed the ones that were, because you have limited capital, and you don't know when
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   you're going to raise your next capital, this idea that you have unlimited capital, you can
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.800]   give money to anybody, no matter what they're doing with respect to their plan, I think,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.120]   is a function of the last 10 years.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:00.000]   But to Chumas points, the idea of tough talk, you know, either out of CEOs or out of board
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.760]   members has been in short supply in Silicon Valley, this idea that saying the truth,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.240]   just speaking the words about needing to get fit or needing to lower the valuation,
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.920]   that somehow that is founder unfriendly is nonsensical.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.200]   The truth is founder friendly, by definition, and I think to Chumas point,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.840]   the less complicated you make this, right, you reset the valuation, you re up the option pool,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.920]   and then everybody has a choice to make.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.320]   And if the people who are on the board and backing the company choose not to re up for
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.000]   whatever reason, they no longer believe in the path forward for the company that's incumbent
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.320]   upon the founder to go find people who will.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.040]   That's not abandonment as it's being framed in this story.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.320]   It is a trade.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:48.640]   And I think maybe if you look at public market investors, Brad, nobody gets upset by a trade,
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.760]   trade to trade.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.320]   But in the private markets, there's a lot more emotion involved a lot more relationship material
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.160]   and this founder friendly concept of like, you're abandoning me.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.800]   It's like, no, the the trade here, it makes no sense for this firm and for this fund and
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.840]   for these LPs, right?
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:09.680]   You know, it's sometimes, sometimes the founder needs to have the courage to look in the mirror
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   and say, what I'm doing is not working.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.560]   I had a plan, I missed the plan by 70%.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.960]   I'm lighting capital on fire.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   This is a charity, not a business.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.200]   It's best to say it didn't work, shut it down and move on and do something else.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.960]   Okay, so of course, you're referencing Salesforce.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.920]   So we'll pivot to that.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.480]   I'm joking.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.320]   It's not that bad.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.000]   But I think this is a good time to maybe talk about the public markets and inflation and
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.120]   what we're seeing in macro.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.440]   So can I set up a question for Brad, actually?
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.000]   Sure, go ahead.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.320]   Yes.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.480]   So so on a previous podcast, I laid out my theory of how you could just use the two year
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:51.520]   bond rate relative to the Fed funds rate to understand where the bond markets sort of
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.760]   prediction market about inflation is going.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:00.880]   And a month ago, the two year bond rate was at 4.1% relative to 4.5% Fed funds rates.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.560]   In other words, the bond market was betting that interest rates would go down between
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.600]   now and two years from now relative to where the Fed had it.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.280]   So therefore, it believed that inflation had been conquered.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.200]   Now, fast forward just one month later, and the two year bond rates at about 4.9%.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.120]   You're the Fed funds rates about four and a half percent.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:30.400]   That is a massive swing, basically 80 basis point swing in the I guess, the two year bond
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:30.720]   rate.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.600]   And so the market seemed to be saying all of a sudden, not just that they expect rates
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.320]   to be higher longer, but also that the Fed needs to keep raising.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.680]   And that is a big change.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.240]   So Brad, what is the basis for that?
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.840]   And what do we now believe about inflation?
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.400]   I think just a few weeks ago, we were thinking that this problem was licked and the market
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.040]   took off like a rocket, it ripped.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.440]   Now, all of a sudden, it seems like investors are really worried that inflation is not over.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.240]   So where does this stand right now?
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.600]   Well, I think when we started the year, you know, the 10 year was close to three, two,
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.880]   we're now we're closer to 4%.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.200]   The 10 minus two is as negative as it's been in the last probably 10 years.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.600]   So the market is clearly saying, you know, we saw some inflation prints that came in
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.320]   hotter.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.520]   I think it's now consensus, which you guys have been saying on the pod, that, you know,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.840]   although the second derivative is slowing, that it's sticky, right, we're going to get
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.560]   stuck at this four, four and a half, three and a half.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.040]   And it's the slope of the curve downward is going to be slower.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.200]   We've gone from thinking we're going to have 225 to now thinking we'll have three or four,
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.560]   you know, and so I think everybody is now bracing for more inflation.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.120]   But remember, when we started the year on January 1, the consensus wisdom was we were
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.240]   going to retest the S&P at 3200, we're going to have an earnings recession, and that inflation
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.920]   was going to continue to run hotter.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:03.680]   The only surprise in my mind so far this year is how well the equity markets have held up
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.800]   in the face of a 10 year that's gone parabolic.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.520]   Right, and an actual earnings recession, right.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.840]   And you, you know, you posted, you know, in our thread, Chamath about just quality of
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.440]   earnings, you know, even the earnings beats are pretty low quality.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:23.520]   And so I think, you know, we now are going to have a couple inflation prints coming up
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.240]   over the course of the next couple weeks that are going to be important.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:32.480]   My hunch is, you know, everybody has tilted again on, you know, what we saw in the last
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.600]   couple prints.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.960]   My suspicion, if you look at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the consensus view is that
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:45.280]   we're still heading in the direction of 4% faster than I think people emotionally think.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.960]   So I would say there's maximum uncertainty in the world.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.400]   The fear that inflation is uncapped the way Larry Summers was articulating November and
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.200]   December is less today than it was.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.000]   But what's emerged is this idea that we're going to have higher rates for longer, and
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.920]   we're going to have higher inflation for longer.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.760]   Now, the question I throw back at you is the market abhors uncertainty.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   The market's done totally fine during periods where we had 3% inflation and 5.5% rates,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.080]   right?
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.320]   When the internet boom that was, you know, 2000 to 2005 rates were a hell of a lot higher
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.840]   than the rates are today.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:32.640]   So I don't think that higher rates and higher inflation means that we can't, you know, invest
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.280]   in venture backed companies that have huge secular growth.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.240]   The world doesn't end.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.720]   But what I do think it means is like, if there's massive uncertainty in the world, if allocators
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.760]   of capital don't know whether rates are going to double again, whether inflation is going
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.000]   to double again, then everything just shuts down.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.920]   And that's really bad for the economy.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.520]   I don't see that happening right now.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.440]   But I do think that the prints over the course of the next eight weeks are going to be important.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.960]   Chamath, you have any macro thoughts here?
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.400]   At the same time, this is happening.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.720]   We saw rents broke in the last month.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.840]   So rents got cheaper.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.720]   A governing principle, I think I probably said it too many times, but I'll say it again,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.000]   rates are going to be higher than we like, and they'll stay here longer than we want.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.040]   So if you use that as a principle, whenever the consensus thinks we're done, it's been
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.760]   pretty profitable to be on the other side of consensus.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.840]   And so I still kind of maintain that we're probably going to have a five and a half percent
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.560]   fed funds rate.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.440]   Which means that, I don't know, maybe Credit Suisse will offer me seven and a half percent
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.560]   soon on three month T-bills, but we're going to have higher rates.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.960]   And I do think Brad's right, though, in the sense that as long as we know that then that's
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.880]   it and we can forecast it into the future without it changing too much, it'll be okay.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:58.640]   But right now, what you're seeing is a lot of make believe going on in the stock market.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.160]   So Nick, if you want to just throw up that image.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.480]   So this is a really interesting chart.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.280]   This is the chart of cash flow versus earnings.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.360]   So this is something that I saw in Bloomberg, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.960]   And if you focus on the period of 2020 to 2024, what you see is the white line, which
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.240]   is net income adjusted for depreciation amortization.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.200]   And the blue line is cash flows from operations.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.000]   So what does that mean?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.080]   And this is for S&P 500 firms.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.160]   This is the best 500 companies in the world.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:37.120]   And the white line is what you tell Wall Street in terms of what you make on paper.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.040]   The blue line is what actually appears in the bank account.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.120]   So why could there be a gap between what you tell somebody you made, I made a dollar versus
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.800]   what's in the bank, 50 cents.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   Well, the reason is that there's all kinds of accounting tricks that you can use, accruals,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:02.240]   inventories, and all of these things allow you to present a healthier earnings report
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.520]   than is actually true.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.240]   And so right now, we have the worst earning situation.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.920]   So the worst gap between what we are telling people versus what is actually in the bank
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.360]   account that we've had for 30 years since 1990.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:24.560]   And so it just brings into focus the fact that we may be in the last few innings of
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.280]   trying to make sure this all looks okay.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:35.840]   In which case, one faction of the investing world who thinks that this earnings recession
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.240]   is actually at hand would be kind of right.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.880]   And then what they would say is that once we all realize that these earnings are fake,
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:49.600]   and you reset down 15%, that's where you get to the mid 3000 in the S&P 500.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.800]   Right now, it's around 4000.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.120]   I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:59.760]   But there's more and more evidence that would support that the way that they see the world
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.640]   could be credible.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.360]   The other side says, Hey, listen, this is a bump in the road.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.440]   We're getting a handle on things.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.560]   And it's stabilizing.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.600]   So even though it's higher than we'd like, it's not going to change that much.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.400]   So now just think about 1015 years from now, and let's go.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.880]   And those are the folks that want to rip the money into growth stocks and tech stocks again,
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:24.080]   how does the consumer play into all this record low unemployment, like it's 1% in Utah,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.280]   three and a half percent for the country, two and a half jobs for every American who's
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:27.920]   unemployed.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.560]   And then these rents coming down.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:35.120]   But consumers have seemed to have burned off all that extra money they had.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.920]   So Brad, when you look at the consumer driven economy that the world lives in,
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.480]   that's not true.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.560]   Because you have to understand, stimulus is still entering the economy, it's just harder
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.200]   to measure.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.280]   So for example, take Social Security, you have cost of living adjustments in Social
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.240]   Security, that's lifting payments by 10 and 15%.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.120]   Because it's backdated for what was going on last year.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:59.680]   And remember, last year, we had two, three, four, 5% inflation rates.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.640]   So there is more and more money coming into people's pockets that we don't realize.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.600]   And we're all on the hook for that as US taxpayers.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.480]   So I think it's very dangerous to kind of look at one data point and try to pick off
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.000]   what's happening in consumer land.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.680]   Because there's all kinds of hidden ways in which money gets back to people.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.080]   Brad, you have thoughts on the consumer?
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.520]   Because, you know, I test, it does seem like consumers are still spending money.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.440]   But the cost of goods in some cases is coming down.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.880]   I mean, how do you look at the consumer and try to make sense of what's going on here?
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.080]   Because it does seem the United States is in its own little bubble here world of just
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.040]   over employment.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.840]   Still, even though we're seeing these layoffs in 10.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   Well, I would say number one, that the pop we've seen in rates, which impacts consumers
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.320]   by way of higher mortgages, higher variable expenses on their credit cards was offset
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.640]   over the last few months by lower energy costs.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.240]   So their cost of gasoline went down.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.800]   Add in the things that Chamath's talking about, and I'm not sure you took a lot of money out
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.000]   of people's pockets.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.720]   I would say this, that again, what we're talking about here, retail sales have continued to
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.760]   do really well.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.200]   E-commerce sales in January were quite strong.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.040]   That would all be consistent with a soft landing.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.800]   But here we are, you know, again, talking about macro.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.680]   I think when you spend this much time talking about macro, doing what we do, you know, like
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.840]   last year, I'll be the first to raise my hand and say, you know, like our friend Bill Gurley
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.440]   would say, it leads you in the wrong direction.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.080]   The fact of the matter is, it's totally unknown and unknowable where we're going to go over
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.920]   the course of the next three or four months.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.600]   I think there's a better ability to predict maybe over the course of the next couple of
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:39.920]   years.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   But the fact is, if you would have told any, I was just with a bunch of investors who probably
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.440]   represent a trillion dollars of public market demand, 10 or so long only investors, if you
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.880]   would have told any of them that the 10-year was going to be at 396, they would have told
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.840]   you that the NASDAQ would be down 10% to start the year.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.360]   And it did just the opposite.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.520]   So I think you got it, you know, you're you have a bunch better chance, particularly if
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.720]   you're playing at home, right, than trying to guess the direction of that find five companies
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.280]   that you think are going to grow and earn more money, irrespective of the direction
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.560]   of rates and inflation, own those and enjoy your life.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:22.400]   I'm looking at the world and going, sacks, my lord, I'm seeing great founders, great
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.640]   companies, and five to $10 million valuations, and I can buy 510 15% of these companies.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:34.400]   This feels like the best it's been for me as an angel investor, seed investor seed fund
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.680]   for a long time.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.800]   This is fantastic.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.120]   Great deal flow.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   The deals are taking six weeks to close.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.200]   We're having very thoughtful discussions.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.440]   People are taking a real focused approach to how they deploy the capital.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.400]   It is not YOLO.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.920]   People are building models again.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.400]   People are showing their cac they're being thoughtful about how they spend the money.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.200]   They're being thoughtful about salaries and hiring.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:04.000]   So what what's your you seem to think that, you know, what we're seeing here is challenging
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.720]   or a problem.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.640]   What are your thoughts on how it's affecting your day to day business as somebody who is
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.840]   a company builder?
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.520]   Well, let's separate two things.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.880]   So there's the tech ecosystem, and there's the economy as a whole.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.640]   The fact of the matter is that tech already had its bubble in 2021.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.520]   It had its crash in 2022, and now we're largely on the other side of that.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.960]   There's still a lot of companies like we talked about that are going to need to restructure
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.760]   who raised during the bubble and may not have come to grips with that.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.400]   But if you're talking about new investment, new rounds, new companies are starting with
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.640]   a clean sheet of paper and a blank slate.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.200]   You're right.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.680]   Things seem good and normal, right?
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.080]   People are making intelligent investments.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.640]   And obviously, the innovation cycle doesn't have anything to do with the macro picture.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:55.840]   I mean, technology wants to evolve, and it's great engineers and product people who drive
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.280]   those ideas forward, and they're not thinking about interest rates.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.760]   I never thought about the Fed funds rate at all when I was a founder running companies.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.800]   So let's just put that aside and acknowledge that great, great innovation is going to keep
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.720]   happening, no matter what the macroeconomic picture looks like.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.400]   That being said, I mean, just for the listeners of the show who aren't startup founders, I
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.160]   tend to be a little bit gloomy about the macro picture right now.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.040]   Because, yeah, it's true that what Brad said, that we've had good economies with 5% rates
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:27.920]   before.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.520]   But I think you also have to look at the pace of change or the rate at which the Fed funds
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.040]   rate has been going up.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:42.720]   And if you look at the chart of rate increases, it is a very steep chart of rate increases.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.360]   And I just think that for the last decade or so, we've been operating in this zero interest
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.920]   rate or ZERP environment with lots of monetary stimulus.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:59.280]   And I think a lot of companies, a lot of parts of the economy got addicted to that stimulus.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.960]   They got hooked on drugs.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.440]   Now, all of a sudden, you're putting them through withdrawal very, very quickly.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.400]   And obviously, the withdrawal pangs are going to be worse if you can't taper off slowly.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   So it looked like just a few weeks ago that the Fed was done raising rates.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.000]   Now, we know that they're not.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.040]   We don't really know when they're going to stop.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:26.320]   So I tend to be a little bit gloomy with respect to the big macro picture, because I just don't
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.440]   see how you can change rates this fast.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.440]   And I mean, you look at like real estate, for example, we just saw the first year over
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.360]   year decrease in the housing market in a while.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.880]   And again, that's all driven by rates, the cost of mortgages going up.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.840]   And two big defaults in the first two big defaults.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.560]   So I think that there's going to be some pain ahead.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.960]   Now, ironically, from the standpoint of the tech ecosystem, we may have already taken
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.520]   our medicine, and we may already be on the other side.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.440]   Actually, that is a good way to to look at as we took the medicine, it's painful.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   And Jason, maybe maybe that's the segue to talking about Benny.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.080]   I would say we haven't took it, we're taking it.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.240]   We're starting to take our medicine.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.600]   Well, it makes sense that Benny off with his, you know, very
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:21.200]   loving family kind of approach to running the company might actually it might take him
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.280]   a little while to become a bit cutthroat.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:31.360]   So as everybody knows, Benny off, and Salesforce have had a lot of turnover, a lot of senior
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.160]   executives have left voluntary or involuntary.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.560]   But shares were up 11%.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   On Thursday, after reporting their Q4 earnings, they're up 14% year over year, small net loss.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:49.520]   But the company bought back $2.3 billion worth of its stock, we're going to see more of that
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.560]   for sure.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:57.200]   And they're going to be increasing its share buy back program to $20 billion going forward.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.960]   And like meta, which suddenly got fit and got religion.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:09.840]   Benny off is now basically with all these activists, I guess on on his ass, he says,
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.880]   in this is the quote from the earnings call, we're more closely scrutinizing every dollar
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.920]   of investment and resource and very focused on driving operational excellence and automation
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.080]   across our business focusing on four key errors, strong long term expense for structuring employee
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.840]   productivity, there it is.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.360]   Product innovation and building relationships with shareholders.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.760]   profitability is our truly our number one strategy.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.280]   And that's my number one strategy.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.920]   That's the number one thing we talked about at the start of every meeting we have in this
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.520]   company, quite a turnaround your thoughts, Brad,
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.560]   I don't think the story is that, you know, that Benny off, you know, made these cuts
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:54.400]   and that activists are around the rim, what was significant was his comments that he made,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.040]   and I tweeted about it today, you know, he said, every CEO in Silicon Valley has looked
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:06.480]   at what Elon Musk has done, and asked themselves, do they need to unleash their own Elon within
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:06.720]   them.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.480]   And, you know, listen, we've been talking about this for nine months.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:18.080]   The reality is, if you look at the employee count at Salesforce, in 2015, they had 19,000
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:18.720]   employees.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.680]   As of last year, they had 80,000.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   In seven years, they 4x the number of employees, they were a mature company.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.800]   By 2015, their employees cagored at 23%.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.320]   You know, we don't talk about it in this way.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.520]   But these large companies, these employee bases, they're not unions, but they may as
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:39.920]   well be.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.380]   Right?
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.280]   Why would that be?
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:49.760]   I just think there's, there is, during this age of excess, where it was just easy for
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.480]   people to hire more people and build more things not to make tough choices, etc.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.520]   Right?
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.240]   We just had an explosion like we've never seen in Silicon Valley, in the number of
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:07.200]   employees in these businesses, meta went from 10,000 to 80,000, 85,000, Google went to 185,000.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.640]   And at those levels, it's very difficult to govern them.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:18.800]   And when the CEOs went to make decisions in the businesses, there would be protests,
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:24.160]   revolts, within the business, 30 or 40,000 people would sign petitions, even say, no,
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.000]   we're not going back to the office.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.400]   No, we're not going to work three days a week.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:33.440]   No, you can't name our AI bot, what you want to name it because it offends us.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:41.120]   And so to me, what's more significant is over the last six months, we've seen courage,
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.720]   gain momentum in Silicon Valley.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.240]   Right?
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.520]   What's deeply underappreciated about meta and the changes they made, it would be one
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:54.240]   thing if it was just window dressing, we cut 10% of the workforce, kind of tighten our
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.440]   belt a little bit.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:00.160]   But Zuckerberg got on his call and he said, we only have two priorities in 2023.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.320]   One is efficiency, and he went into depth about once they started cutting people, how
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:12.320]   the company got faster, the product release cycle sped up, the employees got happier.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.760]   And now it's an end in itself to delay or the business.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.320]   That's what we're hearing out of Benioff as well.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:25.920]   And I think it's, you know, people can quibble with how Elon went about the change, which
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.680]   you and you and David are very familiar with at Twitter.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:36.240]   But the reality is, he lit a fuse in Silicon Valley that is giving courage, whether it's
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.760]   private companies, series B companies, pre IPO companies, public companies, I've had
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:47.440]   that conversation more times than you can imagine over the course of the last six months.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:52.000]   And I think it's a really important change, because I think it breathes new productivity
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.440]   into all these businesses.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:59.040]   And importantly, it unleashes these engineers back into the ecosystem to start the next
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.160]   wave of companies.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.480]   Yeah, Jason, I mean, you and I got to tag along with Elon during that transition phase
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.120]   at Twitter.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:12.640]   And the thing that I took away from it was just how much agency, you know, CEOs have
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.400]   that they're not using.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   I mean, Elon went in there, and he basically changed whatever he saw that he didn't like,
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.120]   I mean, unsentimentally and quickly.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:28.720]   And, you know, and so you look at all these other companies, you talk to CEO sometimes,
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.520]   and they act like they're prisoners of their companies.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.000]   Like, I can't change this, I can't change that.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.120]   Stockholm syndrome, yeah.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.200]   Yeah, it's like, you know, I've got all these employees and all these layers, and but I
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.840]   can't, you know, there's always some reason I'm afraid of the bad PR, or, you know, whatever
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.480]   it is.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.400]   And I, you know, the thing I came away realizing is just how much agency, particularly founder
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.880]   CEOs have, that they just don't use, you know, they're always like hemming and hawing and
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.800]   wringing their hands, and acting like they're tied down by this or that.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.680]   And the reality is, they can do whatever they want, just about, you know, within the bounds
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.800]   of what's what's legal.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.920]   And, and I think they're starting to realize, oh, wait a second, like, I actually can do
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.440]   that, you know, I can walk into my company one day, and if there's a team that's not
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.960]   performing, that's giving me answers that don't make any sense.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.680]   I can start over.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.840]   I'm just gonna start over.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.720]   Yeah, I mean, if you can't get it done, then we need to have somebody who can do it.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.560]   And it's, it's incredible.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:32.240]   Like, we were doing an analysis on this week in startups of the, you know, employees per
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.040]   company and the revenue per employee per headcount.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.600]   And I got roasted for having this calm, even having this conversation.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.120]   And now here we are, Chamath, people are looking at efficiency, we're looking at, you know,
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   really, how efficient can these companies be run?
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.160]   Is there a limit to where this is going?
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.840]   And if we were to look at this as a process, where are the fangs, the Amazons, the Googles,
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:05.760]   Facebook's, where are they at in terms of percentage to being at Elon, if you if you
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:10.000]   were to put Twitter and Elon as the goal, where are these companies and I don't know
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.360]   that that is the goal, maybe maybe he's cut too much, who knows, we'll find out.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.680]   I think it's a it's a it's a pretty radical experiment.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.640]   experiment he's doing there.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:23.520]   Yeah, I don't think that's a reasonable or an achievable goal for a public company.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:27.520]   Okay, I mean, I think the thing we have to keep in mind is Elon is also capable of doing
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:32.800]   that because he paid $44 billion of his own money to buy something that he owns outright,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:38.480]   that no longer has revenue pressure to outside stakeholders, different circumstance revenue
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.080]   went down 70% at Twitter.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:45.200]   Well, that only affects him and his ability to pay whatever he borrowed in order to buy
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:45.680]   that company.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.480]   And as long as he's willing to fund that somehow, he's literally allowed to do whatever he wants.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.440]   That's no longer the case when you're borrowing money from other people to build your business,
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.120]   which is what every other capital market participant does public market participant does and private
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.000]   market participants.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.640]   So I think that that distinction is just a little bit important, because it probably
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.600]   means that there is a shadow of what Elon is doing, that's probably the threshold of
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.040]   what's possible.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:20.240]   And it's probably, you know, sort of 50% headcount reduction, that's probably the, the bound
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.640]   in which things break.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:29.040]   Because I think the thing to keep in mind is that over time, this stuff is like collagen
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:35.280]   in the body, it just like, it creates these interconnected webs of just very difficult
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.800]   stuff that you sin you that you cannot tease apart blockages.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:46.320]   So even if you tried to go in and cut 50% of a company like Facebook, or Google or Microsoft
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.000]   or Apple or Amazon, it would be so difficult, because all of a sudden, the coordination
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.720]   that happens at that scale, I think would get lost.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:59.520]   So I'm not sure if it's possible, you kind of have to do what they're doing, which is
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.000]   cut 5%, then cut 10%, then cut 5%, then cut 5%.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.160]   And I know it frustrates people on the outside looking in, but I think it's the it's probably
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.000]   the only way it can be done without torpedoing the company.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.920]   What does that do on a culture basis, then, because that is the big critique, hey, you're
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.120]   creating now this culture of fear, I guess the opposite of that is you're creating a
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.800]   culture of performance and expectation.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.560]   So how do you think about it on a culture basis, because that keeps coming up from founders
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.680]   to David's point,
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.120]   it depends, because I think companies when they're smaller, I mean, I can tell you,
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:36.480]   when I was a part of the Facebook senior management team, we would rank all the employees.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.840]   So we had a very good sense of who was the best and the most performant all the way down
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.600]   to who was not and we were able to do that.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.560]   Probably up to two or 3000 employees.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.680]   That's not possible at 50,000 and nor is it fair.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.280]   So because you don't know who these folks are, the real contributors are, you have to
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.680]   do what Elon did, which is literally go person to person and say, who is unbelievably performant,
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.280]   or critical.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.760]   In the absence of doing that, you just don't know who to let go.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.160]   And so you have no choice except to bleed down the question that I have, and Brad, maybe
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.960]   there's a smart analyst on your team that can do it is right.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.160]   And it's more of a statement as well.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:22.800]   Can you imagine the totality of stock based comp that's been given out by all these companies
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.160]   since 2015?
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:31.920]   When they were cagering their employee bases by 25% a year, I bet you it's a trillion and
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.520]   a half dollars at least.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.480]   You think it's that you think it's in that order of magnitude?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.280]   100% this has been the greatest grift in the history of Silicon Valley for sure.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.960]   Let's pause for a second.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.800]   Can you explain what we're talking about here?
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   Stock based compensation obviously is the stock given to employees.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.240]   It's generally not counted.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.920]   Well, let's do it in the accounting, right?
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.640]   Let's do it this way.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.600]   Let's just say that you believe in capitalism.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.240]   Okay?
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:56.560]   Yep.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.280]   So if you if you believe in capitalism, let's say the four of us start a company.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.720]   And there's $1 of profit and we each own 25% of the company.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.220]   Got it.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:12.160]   Normally, what you would say is each of us get 25 cents.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.600]   Right?
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.400]   Reasonable.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.760]   We own 25% each, there's $1 of profit, we each have 20.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   So that means that in four years, right, we each will have made $1 because so let's just
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.880]   say it costs $1 to get off the ground or $4 to get off the ground.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   All in summit budget, we believe.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.200]   We all would have been made whole, we all would feel great.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.040]   And then now every year afterwards, that 25 cents we get is profit.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.440]   Now let's say that Jason, you add a fifth person, and Brad and David and I can't say
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.640]   anything about it.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.280]   Okay.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.000]   And that fifth person now gets a fifth of it.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:44.500]   Right.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.320]   And so now all of a sudden, our 25 cents goes down to 20 cents.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:54.320]   Then let's say you add five more people now all of a sudden are 25 cents went to 20.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.840]   And then it went to 10 cents.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.200]   And at some point, Brad and David and I raise our hand and say, Hey, this is not the deal
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.080]   we signed up for.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.720]   And you say, well, too bad because revenue would not be what it is.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.360]   And profits would not be what it is without these extra six people.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.600]   And that's effectively what everybody debates when they own a stock.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.440]   The shareholders want that number to be as small as possible.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.240]   And I think what Brad is observing is that in Silicon Valley, what has happened is there's
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.320]   been poor accountability for what all of those extra people do.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:38.880]   And profits haven't written risen fast enough to make the existing three people on the cap
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.560]   table feel okay about it.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:47.120]   And that instead of talking about three people and six and $1, you're talking about trillions
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.400]   of dollars and hundreds of 1000s of extra shareholders, Brad, millions of extra share.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.600]   And then we have some charts here so we can do some fun with numbers.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.920]   I think taking a step back, I think it's very important to realize that stock as a form
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:08.160]   of compensation to create alignment, excitement in the early stage of venture capital is part
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.240]   of the true magic of Silicon Valley.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.720]   You know, you're starting a company, you ask somebody to go on this adventure, take a bunch
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.160]   of risks, they often have to cut their pay, they could get at Google by half to join your
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.840]   adventure, it's only fair that you give them stock in the company and they share the ups.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:29.280]   And if the company smokes it, they get rich for taking that incremental risk on their
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.800]   behalf and on their family's behalf.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:38.000]   What's happened over the last 15 years is something totally different, which is this
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.800]   stock as a form of early stage compensation, right, continued.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:50.880]   And there's a feature in Silicon Valley as companies came public, one way to kind of
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.240]   hide an expense in a business is to bury it in SBC.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.560]   So let's say Google wanted to hire somebody for $4 million, which they're doing today
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.120]   in AI.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:07.040]   But instead of paying them $4 million in cash, which would all count against their operating
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.800]   profit, they give them $500,000 in cash and $3.5 million in stock.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.120]   And let's say they make all that stock investable immediately, Jason, in this year.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.200]   It's obvious to you and I that's just cash, the person turns around and sells it.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.560]   It's a real expense of the business, real expense to the shareholders.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.840]   But when they report their earnings, and they report adjusted EBITDA, they adjust out the
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.440]   $3.5 million that they gave by way of SBC.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.560]   Why did stock based comp SBC get excluded from accounting?
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.480]   What is the history of that?
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.840]   And is that going to change now?
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.040]   Are people going to say and shareholders demand in this new economy in this new, you know,
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.160]   sort of reality?
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.880]   Hey, you know what, you can't play fun with numbers here.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.720]   Stock based comp has to come out.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.560]   What would you like to see Brad?
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.840]   It's fairly esoteric, but there are back in the mid 2000s 2004 2005.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.200]   There was an accounting, there was a big debate about this Warren Buffett was famously saying,
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.520]   listen, it doesn't matter whether you pay in stock, whether you pay in cash, whether
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.280]   you pay in cans of beers, like it all costs the same.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.080]   He's right.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.840]   And so there was a debate.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.840]   We had a statement and accounting statement FASB 123.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:28.320]   And in that statement, it said gap EBITDA must include the cost of stock based compensation.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.480]   So all of a sudden, if I'm reporting gap EBITDA, I got to include the cost of stock,
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.440]   which it does today.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.840]   But what but but what did everybody do?
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.000]   But what happened?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.920]   They started adjusting it out.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.280]   Right?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.640]   Because they said, Hey, this is a real expense, right?
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.160]   Because we're not it's not cash.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.760]   We're giving out the dollar solid.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.880]   Do they come up with a term for this?
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.360]   Adjusted?
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.160]   No, they just call it adjusted.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.680]   Just a joke.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.000]   Crime.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:05.600]   The crime here is that when rates fell to zero, and everybody was making money on tech stocks,
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.920]   nobody wanted to rock this boat.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:13.040]   And everybody just said, you know, like adjusted EBITDA kind of ignored, I can, I can model it
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.480]   into my future dilution.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.400]   So we model up share count over the course of the next three years.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.800]   But this literally over the last five years, went parabolic.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.120]   Because I just shared with you the number of employees exploded.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.280]   The amount of share based compensation exploded.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.440]   I think there's a competition for those employees, we would assume based I think just reported
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:46.560]   SPC, which hold your hat, sacks was 70% of revenue, not 70% of their earnings, 70% of
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.440]   their revenue.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.680]   Just for Coinbase we're talking about here.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.800]   That's for Coinbase.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.960]   And so you know, last week, there was something that I thought was pretty brave.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:01.040]   Booking.com on their earnings call, really called this out.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.840]   And what they said is, listen, we've been playing by the rules.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.240]   We understand that stock based comp is cash.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:16.160]   And they say every every metric we report includes the impact of stock based compensation.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:23.040]   And if you look over the last 15 years, if I'm an owner of booking.com, I was only diluted
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:23.840]   by about 5%.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.640]   If I was an owner of Salesforce or Expedia, I was diluted by about 25%.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.600]   That's 25% of my ups were given away.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.720]   Right.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.800]   But yet those things were adjusted out when they reported earnings.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.320]   And so, you know, what's become in vogue today is CFOs get on their calls and they say, no,
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.520]   no, no, no, don't worry, we're gonna buy back a lot of shares.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.760]   So we won't have much dilution.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.760]   Okay, but if you take my 2 billion of profits that Chamath just talked about, and it goes
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.720]   right out the door, just to buy back the shares you just issued, you're effectively round
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.440]   tripping that money, then it just proves the point.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.640]   It's cash.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.560]   It's an expense to shareholders.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.920]   And my biggest problem with it is it's led to the bloat.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:21.680]   Because if companies actually had to account for this as cash, right, as opposed to being
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.400]   able to do it, they wouldn't hire as many people, they wouldn't pay as much in stock
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.040]   comp.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.160]   And I'll end with this because I want to end with the solution.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:37.520]   Every comp committee on every board, frankly, their heads spin when you start talking about
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.160]   this subject.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.560]   They bring in a comp consultant.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:47.280]   And the comp consultant, they is really the CYA for the comp committee, because they want
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.560]   to approve a comp plan that's been recommended by the management team.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.200]   And they just want to know, is this what everybody else is doing?
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.320]   Okay, so everybody's doing it.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.840]   So the comp consultant looks around and says, yeah, all your peers are doing this.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.800]   This is why Charlie Munger said, I'd rather throw a pit viper down the front of my shirt
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.160]   than hire a comp consultant.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.440]   Right?
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.520]   What is going on on these comp committees?
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:16.800]   If you give bonuses to anybody in your business that is based on an adjusted EBITDA metric,
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:23.120]   rather than free cash flow per share, per share is the key here.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.080]   It's negligence.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.160]   It's negligence.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.960]   So if comp committees just walk in and they say the gold standard as a public company
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.880]   is 50 basis points, annual dilution, that's Apple, that's booking.com, Visa, MasterCard,
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.080]   or even below that.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.800]   That's the gold standard once you're in the public markets.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:47.360]   And we will never incentivize our employees on the basis of anything that excludes.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.040]   Stock comp, and it has to be on a per share basis.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.480]   That would be a massive leap forward for public company accounts.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.280]   Seems reasonable.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.800]   Anybody have any other thoughts on that?
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.520]   Stock based comp?
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.400]   No.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.480]   All right, Sax, where do you want to go?
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.440]   You want to go Fox?
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.320]   I'm willing to do Fox.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.360]   Yeah, let's do Fox.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.120]   I mean, Fox is kind of crazy.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.920]   Okay, so Rupert Murdoch had been deposed here with this Dominion voting system lawsuit.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:17.120]   They're suing Fox for 1.6 billion in damages over claims made on air.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.360]   That we all know, around technology enabled election fraud.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.720]   We remember this wild period at the end of the last election cycle with this incredibly
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.040]   false claim that the election was stolen.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.120]   Something, you know, both sides of the aisle said did not happen.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:40.720]   However, it seems that the hosts on Fox knew it wasn't happening, knew it wasn't true,
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:46.720]   but were engaging in entertainment of allowing these people to come on air and say the election
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.520]   was stolen.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:53.920]   So Murdoch said, I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.720]   And when asked if he could have stopped the host from highlighting these allegations,
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.720]   these false allegations on air that were obvious to everybody, he said, I could have, but I
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.200]   didn't.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.080]   He said the truth.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.000]   He's not allowed to lie in court.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.240]   Just on air, but not in court.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.520]   I mean, Sax, to be fair, like you really care about freedom of speech.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.680]   You really care about the libel laws.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.680]   You really care about the GOP.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.440]   Obviously, you bring it up every week here.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.680]   So when you looked at and but you were very clear, you were not happy about the election
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.320]   denial, all that, like false claims that Trump made and these insane people he put around
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:30.640]   himself.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.000]   So how do you look at these Fox hosts and listen, you've been on Tucker and other things,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.760]   knowingly spreading lies about something as important as the election, and then doing
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.120]   it in the most cynical ways.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.680]   We sit here and every week we roast the media, the mainstream media, you particularly go
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.160]   after the dams and the left and the media elites.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.160]   How do you feel about these media elites who are part of the GOP machine lying incessantly
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:04.880]   about something as important as the election integrity of the United States of America?
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.000]   First of all, you're trying to tee this up as some giant dunk on me, Jay Cal.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.280]   No, I'm not.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   You said from the beginning, I need to remind the audience, you didn't believe in this.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:13.840]   Exactly.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.720]   Let's go back to November of 2020 on this show, because there may be a lot of parts of
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.400]   the audience that weren't watching back then.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:27.440]   I was really clear that I said Sidney Powell and 100% and Rudy Giuliani, I thought they
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.480]   were wackos.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.080]   And this whole idea that the Dominion voting machines had somehow been rigged, and somehow
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.720]   it involved Hugo Chavez was a wild conspiracy theory.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:42.000]   So I said at the time, 100%, and I also said that I thought that once the Supreme Court
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:48.080]   denied certiorari to Trump, I said that he had his right to have his day in court and
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.280]   to challenge the election in court, but once that the court threw out his claims, and the
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.480]   Supreme Court denied certiorari, that that whole thing needed to stop.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.840]   And it didn't stop.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.640]   And that's why the Republicans lost that Perdue runoff seat in Georgia on January 5th, and
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.600]   then you had January 6th.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.640]   So I've been warning against this for a long time, Jay Cal.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:11.600]   Now with respect to Fox, I think you need to basically get a little bit more nuanced
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.120]   in what you're saying there.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.880]   Because I think within Fox, there were actually two groups of hosts.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.680]   So there is one group of hosts that I think you could say were Trump loyalists.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:28.000]   And they basically not only platformed the Sidney Powell lies, but also endorsed them.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.920]   And Rupert Murdoch admitted that they went too far and actually endorsed.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.920]   And so you had Hannity and a couple other hosts do that, even though Hannity was a
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.360]   good host, even though Hannity had some text messages that indicated he didn't believe
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.360]   it.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.600]   So I think he came across the worst.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.480]   However, there were within Fox skeptics of the Sidney Powell theory.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.640]   And so I'd put Tucker Carlson in that camp, I put Laurie Ingram in that camp.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.400]   And Tucker had Sidney Powell on his show on, I think it was November 19th, I think this
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.760]   was 16 days after the election.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.560]   It was a 20-minute interview in which he grilled her and he kept coming back to, "What is your
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   evidence?
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.560]   What is your proof?"
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.640]   And if you were paying attention, he demolished her.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   I mean,
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   I remember that notable.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.280]   So I mean, honestly, no one looks great when all of your text messages come out.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.280]   And you can nitpick about this or that text.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.720]   But the bottom line is, I think Tucker did his job.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.080]   You know, yes, he platform Sidney Powell, but he platformed her in order to dismantle
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.080]   her.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.840]   And you kind of have to be pretty dopey not to see that she was dismantled after the appearance
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840]   on Tucker.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:34.520]   Would you say that he would be liable for knowingly platforming these people and endorsing
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.720]   them in some way?
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:43.520]   Or is it their freedom of speech in your mind, as an attorney here, or somebody with that,
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   you know, legal degree?
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.120]   Where does it stand?
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.560]   Like put aside if this was if this was CNN doing it, MSNBC will switch what publication
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:57.120]   if this was the New York Times, and they knowingly lied, knowingly platformed some coops, conspiracy
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.680]   theory, what should the price they pay for?
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:03.800]   And then how does that affect the freedom of speech that we all think I think universally
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.480]   on this podcast, especially and in Silicon Valley, or at least we used to, that freedom
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.660]   of speech is really important.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.600]   Do you have the freedom to lie and platform?
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.600]   coops like this?
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.360]   Let me answer you directly, Jason, I think this would be a better world if Fox reliable,
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.640]   but I don't think they're gonna be because that's not the legal standard.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:27.800]   I believe that if a television network knowingly spreads and endorses baseless accusations
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.440]   against somebody, which they know or should know is basically untrue, I think they should
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.360]   absolutely be liable for libel or defamation.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.000]   But that is not what the law requires under New York Times versus Sullivan, you're required
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.480]   to show that that they knowingly spread misinformation.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.720]   But in addition, you have to show that they had actual malice, which is that their intent
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.120]   was malicious.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:53.560]   And I think, you know, Rupert Murdoch is a wily old dog, because he admitted on the
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.920]   stand everything but the thing that was most important for the plaintiffs to prove, which
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.200]   is actual malice.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.600]   He admitted that they platform things that they, you know, knew or should have known
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.600]   were false.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.060]   He admitted that he should have put a lid on it sooner.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.960]   He admitted that he knew it wasn't true.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.800]   But he said the reason they did it is because they're afraid of their audience or a portion
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.240]   of their audience going to some rival network.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.660]   So basically, what he said is, in not so many words, is that his motivation was greed.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:25.760]   And in our system of law, that is a complete defense against claims of defamation.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.120]   Now, I think what we need here is to rewrite the defamation laws.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.920]   I think the Supreme Court needs to overturn New York versus Sullivan.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.040]   Clarence Thomas is basically intimated that he would support that.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.640]   I think that would be a great thing to do.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.400]   I think actual malice should not be the requirement for libel.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.680]   I think if a television network or a publication puts out information they know is false, they
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.400]   should absolutely be liable for it.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.840]   And that is enough to show.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.720]   And if we did that, by the way, it wouldn't just be Fox in this particular case.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.840]   It'd be CNN and MSNBC.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.920]   We have to completely revise their coverage.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.220]   And all of these tech reporters who do nothing but defame the tech industry, the entire tech
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.160]   press just about, is a slow-moving defamation lawsuit.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.640]   Elon Musk would probably be the richest man in the world just based on all the defamation
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.720]   lawsuits he could bring if we were to overturn New York Times versus Sullivan.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.040]   The richest, richer guy?
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:23.320]   Yeah, because all they do is defame Elon Musk every week with claims that are ridiculous.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.640]   So listen, let's revise the whole thing.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.640]   Okay, wow.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.640]   There you go, folks.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.280]   Very, very intellectually honest.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.280]   I like it.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:36.160]   David, so what you're saying is you expect the Dominion lawsuit to fail.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.040]   Can it be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court?
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.880]   Can this be the case that rewrites New York versus Sullivan?
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   Good question.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880]   That's a good question.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.880]   I'm not sure.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880]   I mean, I think that'd be great if it did.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.440]   Just to be clear, listen, I think that if Fox were somehow found guilty, I think one
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.400]   and a half billion is kind of a ridiculous amount of damages.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.840]   I don't think Dominion was damaged to one and a half billion.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:59.560]   But do I think that it would be a good thing if this lawsuit were challenged all the way
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.320]   to the Supreme Court and they overruled New York Times versus Sullivan?
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   That'd be a great thing.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.320]   Let's fund the lawsuit.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   I would fund that lawsuit.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:12.000]   But the next thing I want to do is sue MSNBC and CNN for all the nonsense they spread every
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   night.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.560]   Just to be clear, I have a couple of things that I would want to go and get correct, clean
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.560]   up.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.440]   I just want to be clear here, though, Brad, David's guy, Tucker, he did the right thing.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.880]   That's the most important part of the story, isn't it, David?
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.240]   You're still a sucker for Tucker.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.520]   You're not being nuanced.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.840]   You want to throw Tucker under the bus.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840]   I think Tucker did his job.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:32.840]   No, I don't.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.840]   I think Tucker did his job.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840]   Paradoxically.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   Tucker did his job.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840]   Tucker did his job, yes.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.920]   Yeah, I think the guy who looks a little worse is Anity because Anity in the text admitted
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.280]   he didn't believe the story.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.560]   But as a Trump loyalist, he endorsed the bullshit theory.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560]   That's no good.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560]   No good.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.500]   Brad, you come on the show every couple of episodes and pitch in here as our fifth Beatle.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.720]   Would you like to touch the third rail?
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.720]   What are your thoughts?
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.840]   And would you like to get some incoming email from all your LPs about your position on Fox
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840]   News and Trump?
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.840]   I mean, I think that's humiliating.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:09.520]   I mean, we just I just feel like I sat through a University of Chicago law school class.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.680]   It was awesome.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.760]   And I think we have some good issues here that we still got to tick off on J. Cal.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:16.760]   Yes.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.840]   Okay, well, we got to talk just for a second about China as it relates to tick tock.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.800]   Because because this right here we go.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.440]   This Holly hearing that's coming up.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.300]   So we've got a hearing in Congress.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.240]   Let's start with you are a shareholder, a significant shareholder in ByteDance, the
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.240]   parent company of Tick Tock.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.360]   We have to correct, correct, correct.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.640]   And you absolutely you started that and my kids use Tick Tock.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.320]   And my kids use reels and everybody you and I've had a spirited debate on Yes, you're
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   a shareholder.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.960]   Okay, so about this, so I so I haven't seen it up.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   You want to see it?
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   But hold on a second here.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.240]   Like because just like sacks had to defend himself before he even got started.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.240]   Otherwise, you wonder my credibility.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.720]   I have to do the same thing.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:04.400]   I'm a shareholder of meta, who stands to do incredibly well, if Tick Tock in the US is
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.400]   banned.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.400]   So you have a spread.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.080]   Wait, you win either way.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.920]   I've got a hedge on good.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.000]   Okay, you know, Tick Tock in the US gets banned.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.560]   But you know, the con the context here is the Tick Tock ban debate is heating up.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.560]   Right.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.200]   And it's all in a march up to the Holly hearing.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.840]   I think it's on March 23.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.240]   And there's real like we spent a lot of time at the start of this pod on inflation, I think
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.280]   a much bigger issue right now.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:37.160]   I was just with all these investors, the main issue on their mind was global decoupling
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.560]   between China and the United States.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:47.280]   We're going to see a level of Chinese hate leveled out of out of Congress both sides.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.840]   I mean, we heard it Chamath at dinner at your place not so long ago, that this hearing is
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:57.200]   drawing more demand for speakers from both sides of the aisle than any such conference
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.720]   in a long time.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:04.120]   But there's a lot of there's a lot of heat now around Tick Tock should it be banned.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:09.520]   And when I when I look at the situation, if you frame it for ByteDance, because Chamath
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.600]   talked about this a couple weeks ago, it's been reported.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.120]   ByteDance's revenue is about $120 billion.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.060]   It's been reported their profits are about $25 billion.
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.320]   That is almost identical in size to Meta.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.920]   Meta is worth about $450 billion.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.240]   So $120 billion top line.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.720]   It's also been leaked that in that Tick Tock is about $14 billion of that.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.040]   And that US Tick Tock is $3 to $4 billion.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:42.640]   US Tick Tock $3 to $4 billion of $120 billion and it loses money.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.640]   So there's a lot of debate, should we ban it?
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.640]   Should we not ban it?
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:47.640]   Is it going to go public?
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.640]   What should happen?
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.640]   What do you think?
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.640]   What do you want to happen as a shareholder?
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.320]   And I think it's a pan American.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:57.240]   I think this is a puppet debate over a much bigger conversation that's going on.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.120]   One of the things I've urged the company to do over the course of the last several years
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.560]   is parental controls.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.240]   My kids use Tick Tock, they use reels.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.980]   And what I want is to be able to set effective time limits.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:15.440]   And I also want Tick Tock has incredible video content in math, in science and history.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.600]   I want to be able to set a slider and say 20% of the videos that get shown over this
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.280]   one hour period have to include some of these math and science videos for my 12 year old.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.480]   Then he can elect to not watch at all or watch it.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   They announced those product changes yesterday.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.240]   So they're teeing up those product changes.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.100]   I don't happen to think there's a nefarious plot.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.920]   But I also understand that people might not want this.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.080]   And so like, listen, I think we should have a debate.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:48.200]   I think that the CEO of Tick Tock should show up, he should speak the truth at the Hawley
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.560]   hearing and if the US Congress wants to ban Tick Tock in the US or force a spin or a sale,
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.520]   I think we should do it and stop debating it.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:02.080]   But the much larger conversation is whether we have a hard or a soft decoupling with China.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.120]   And I think this is just canary in the colon.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.120]   All right.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.880]   So let me just tee up also, and Chamath I'll get your reaction.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.280]   On Monday, the White House gave government agencies 30 days to remove Tick Tock from
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.240]   all federal devices, all federal agencies must delete Tick Tock from phones and systems
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.000]   and prohibit internet traffic from reaching the company.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.960]   This is following moves by Canada and the EU and Taiwan.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:30.680]   And obviously, there is a bigger House Committee focused on China that held its first meeting
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   this week.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.840]   So there is the bigger picture.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.000]   But let's start with the smaller picture.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.920]   Number one, Chamath, do you think it's a security risk to have a Chinese company have this kind
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:42.240]   of access and influence with Tick Tock specifically?
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.400]   And what do you think the remedy should be for that?
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   And then we'll get big picture.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.320]   I want to get sacks involved in this as well.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.600]   Should it be banned?
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.560]   Should they have this kind of access to Americans and influence?
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   Should it be banned?
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:57.720]   No, because I believe in a free market.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.480]   Will it be banned?
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.640]   Yes.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:12.480]   Because it's the most obvious cultural way to pick a fight with China without actually
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.920]   picking a fight with China.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.880]   So yeah, I think it's going to be the most obvious victim of all of this.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   And so I don't know my advice to my friends who are shareholders, not just Brad, but others
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.280]   is sell, sell it, move on.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.640]   It's in the Warren Buffett, what Warren Buffett calls the two hard bucket.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.800]   Saks, do you think that this is a national security issue?
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.200]   Do you personally believe Tick Tock should be banned?
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:45.000]   Or do you like me believe that we should just do a reciprocation test in order for Tick
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.240]   Tock to be allowed here in the United States, then Twitter, Facebook, Meta, Instagram, LinkedIn,
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.320]   etc. need to be allowed in China and you have this many days to reciprocate or else it's
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.320]   banned.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.720]   I don't think Jamal is right that Tick Tock is going to be GPC roadkill and GPC stands
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.200]   for great power competition.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.240]   You're going to start hearing that term more and more.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.400]   It's going to become the organizing principle of American foreign policy.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.720]   And I just think that Tick Tock is all caught up in that.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.240]   And you know, personally, I'd like to understand what it is exactly that they're doing with
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.240]   Tick Tock.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.400]   And so just having these vague accusations, I'd actually really like to understand the
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   underlying surveillance that they might be doing.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.080]   Yeah, I'd like to know a lot more about that.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.360]   But in any event, I just think you're gonna get caught up in this, again, GPC, that's
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:37.120]   going to be the dominant organizing principle of our foreign policy.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.760]   I think that people are coming around to realizing that it's China, not Russia, that is the central
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.780]   global competitor and adversary of the United States.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:50.240]   It's the only country in the world that's a potential peer competitor to the US.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.040]   economy is roughly the same size, the US has got four times the population.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.600]   It's the one that we really need to watch out for.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:04.680]   I think there's growing realization in Washington, that the Ukraine war is a little bit of a
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.880]   misdirect and that we need to basically get back to doing what we were doing before the
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.280]   war, which is pivoting to Asia.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.560]   And by the way, thinking about that just for a second.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.760]   I think David, you're totally right, because the game theory now, to me, makes a lot more
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.400]   sense in the frame in the framing of GPC.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:29.960]   So for example, if you think about what the CHIPS Act does, right, the CHIPS Act basically
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:37.840]   says we are going to near shore, or onshore, every capability we need, so that we can make
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.200]   and manufacture all the critical semiconductors for all of our interests, technological, business,
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.000]   military, etc.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.480]   But what is that really?
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.480]   What that is, is an option to not have to defend Taiwan.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.840]   And why is that important?
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.180]   It's because today if Taiwan were invaded by China, we get pulled into a conflagration
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:00.000]   that we don't know how it ends.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.300]   We don't know what the beginning, middle, or end of it looks like.
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:04.920]   It's extremely dangerous and precarious.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:10.960]   So spend a couple trillion dollars, create financial incentives, build a bridge to Korea
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:17.240]   and to Japan so that they bring onshore and into Mexico all the capabilities we need with
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.720]   Western Europe, who are already our allies already, along with Japan and Korea.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.040]   And now all of a sudden, we have complete optionality.
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:29.160]   And now we can deal with the greater Chinese hegemony in a much more balanced way.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:36.720]   So I think the GPC framing is shared, by the way, between the Democrats and the Republicans.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.780]   So this is why it's so much bigger than one single company.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:44.240]   That's why I think I think tick tocks roadkill Brad, if we frame it as a competition, we're
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.920]   not framing it as a war.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.240]   We're in competition.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:53.080]   And part of that is going to be this decoupling is this decoupling helpful to America?
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.640]   Is it helpful to humanity?
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:01.040]   Is it better that we decouple a bit this interdependency maybe got a little too deep as we saw during
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.800]   COVID with supply chains?
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.320]   Well, I mean, it's a great in a great power struggle.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.240]   It is what the words imply.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.380]   Right?
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:15.160]   So I don't, you know, part of the reason you want to have trade with China, and part of
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.880]   the reason we don't want to have a hard decoupling is, you know, a long standing theory that
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.880]   company countries that trade together are less likely to go to war.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:29.420]   So you know, I think if you listen to what's coming out of this, you know, these select
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:35.440]   committee this week that held his first hearing is on the on the extremes, you hear people
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.080]   saying hard decoupling, right?
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.040]   And in the middle, you have people saying, Listen, we need to define a circumference
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.000]   around national security.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.840]   And we need to decouple as to all things that are within that circumference.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.640]   Now I will tell you that the debate is about how large is that circle.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.720]   So it starts off as for example, sophisticated computer chips out of Nvidia.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:01.080]   So China, you know, can't compete with us in the AI arms race.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:08.400]   But it's quickly emerged into, you know, batteries, energy, food, supply chains, it
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.520]   the circumference has now become almost as large as the economy itself.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.640]   I would argue that it's not just the chips act.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:21.560]   It's also IRA, which is another trillion dollars of funding for basically onshore and supply
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:28.480]   chains, vital materials to build batteries, etc.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.760]   You know, so I think it's a very reasonable policy by both parties to pursue, it's clear
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.800]   that we're going to have some decoupling.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.400]   I think it's a it's a it's going to lead to an interesting question on the part of China.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:47.120]   You know, she was out last week saying, you know, I'm going to make a speech about peace
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.120]   with Russia.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:51.280]   You know, this is more David's territory.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:56.520]   But my hunch is that there may be, you know, if China, China thinks there's going to be
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:02.200]   a hard decoupling from an economic perspective, this is bad for global economic growth.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.680]   This is bad for China's growth.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.960]   I don't think it's bad for growth.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.880]   I think it's bad for inflation.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.880]   Explain.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:12.200]   Well, because I think that we'll have many versions of everything everywhere.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.320]   So we will more redundancy.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.360]   Yeah, more redundancy.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:21.240]   We're gonna rely on Central and South America in a meaningfully bigger way.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.800]   And what that'll mean is that there'll be more jobs and economic prosperity for those
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:25.800]   countries.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:28.040]   And if you feed it to the United States, China will feed it less.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:32.160]   And as a result, there'll be more inflation because you won't have the cost advantages.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.840]   By the way, China is not just going to sit there and take this lying down.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.240]   They've already punched back a few times.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:43.640]   So for example, in the middle of the summer, China introduced a tariff and slowing the
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.320]   export of certain materials and technology to make solar wafers.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.200]   Now, why is that critical?
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.560]   Well, again, talked about this before, but we are going to take the marginal cost of
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.720]   energy to zero in this country.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:01.320]   And the levelized cost of energy, particularly via solar is the cheapest it's ever been.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.520]   And so what China sees is, oh my gosh, if the United States has abundant free energy,
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.960]   now a huge component of what drives costs is gone.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.720]   So now the United States could partner with El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras, you know, Argentina,
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.720]   Brazil,
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.720]   Vietnam is happening here too.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.920]   No, but I'm just saying it's close by.
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.920]   Yes, right.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.000]   And if you can deliver zero cost energy to those places, now the manufacturing capability
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000]   could exist there.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.280]   My point is, it's such a complicated chess piece.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.200]   So China's not taking any of this lying down.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:36.680]   But I think that what David's framing is totally accurate.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.920]   This is the beginning of a GPC and it's an economic tit for tat that we're going to play
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.920]   out.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:50.120]   We tax chips, they tax solar panels, we go after TikTok just as a confusion maker, right?
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:54.000]   Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of follies back and forth here.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.960]   I can tell you the the there's a very easy test for if China sees TikTok as a strategic
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.960]   asset.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.360]   And that's, it's going to create more shareholder value, Brad, if they were to spin it out and
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.320]   make it a publicly traded American company with American shareholders, it would create
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.600]   more shareholder value for ByteDance.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.520]   Therefore, if they don't spin it out, that means they're not acting in the interest of
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.920]   shareholders and shareholder value.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.120]   They're acting in the interest of their national security.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:27.680]   Pretty clear reciprocation and collaboration would be a much better model, I think for
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.400]   for working with the Chinese and hopefully we can find some things I might just elaborate
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.800]   on Brad raised the the Chinese peace proposal on Ukraine, which I think is an interesting
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.800]   topic.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.800]   Can we you guys want to go there for a minute?
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.800]   Sure.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800]   All right.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.920]   Can I take a shot explaining what the Chinese were doing?
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.960]   I think it was a clever diplomatic maneuver by the Chinese to try and grab the moral high
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.200]   ground here.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.000]   They're basically saying, listen, we're interested in peace, we're going to put forward a proposal.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.800]   The Americans fell into the trap of basically dismissing it right away, throwing cold water
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800]   on it.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.720]   The US State Department has done this twice before.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.920]   Remember, back in March of last year, Naftali Bennett from Israel tried to negotiate a peace
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.760]   deal and he himself said that it was the West, the Americans who rejected it.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.320]   He thought it had a 50/50 chance of succeeding.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:17.960]   You then had the peace process in Istanbul, Turkey, with Erdogan presiding over it.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:23.960]   You had the Istanbul communique, which again, they were very close to having a peace deal
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.520]   and Blinken and the US threw cold water on it.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:32.760]   So what's happening here is that the US is not playing its traditional role as peacemaker.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:36.000]   We try to go in and mediate these conflicts.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   We're doing the opposite of that.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.520]   We're throwing cold water on the peace process.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.600]   Now, why are we not acting as the mediator?
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.600]   I'll tell you why.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.640]   We are a co belligerent.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:46.360]   This is an American proxy war that we're fighting against Russia.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:48.760]   So we have no interest in mediating a peace process.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:53.760]   And moreover, we're not trusted to mediate a peace process because we're one of the effectively
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760]   one of the combatants.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:59.040]   So it's a PR strategy by Xi Jinping to take the global moral high ground.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.040]   I agree with that.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.560]   I said it on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.080]   This is amazing that he's starting the peace process.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.380]   We want regime change.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.120]   We want to deplete and we want to ankle Putin.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.320]   They want to keep him in the game.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.840]   The more despots there are, the worse, the better it is for them.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.880]   They would like to keep the Legion of Doom going.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.520]   They don't want to see regime change and democracy in Russia.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.560]   Eventually, I don't think that's how they view it.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.040]   But listen, Jake, Jake, I was very close to getting it.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.520]   But here's where I would disagree with you a little bit.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.520]   Let me explain.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.600]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:36.560]   So from the Chinese point of view, the war in Ukraine is like mana from heaven.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:39.140]   Okay, they love this war.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:44.480]   Number one, okay, because it's interfering with the US's pivot to Asia.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:49.600]   We were basically in the process of redeploying all of our force, all of our military to containing
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.080]   them in East Asia.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.240]   And now we're bogged down in Europe.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.360]   Okay, so that's number one.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.680]   Number two, we are massively depleting our stockpiles of weapons.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.520]   We've used something like nine years of stingers and five years of javelins.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.520]   And we're running out of ammunition.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.520]   I can't believe it.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.000]   We're running out of artillery.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.380]   The Russians actually have a six to one artillery advantage, which is why they're actually doing
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:14.220]   much better in this war than people are acknowledging.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.840]   We should come back to that.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.300]   The last thing is that the Chinese now are benefiting from the economic sanctions on
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:26.940]   Russia because Russia is now selling them oil and gas and all their minerals at a big
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:27.940]   discount.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:28.940]   Subsidy.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:31.460]   So this has been a wonderful thing from the Chinese standpoint.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.660]   So this is the problem with us thinking in this Marvel movie way of the world in which
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.300]   we're the super friends and we're against the Legion of Doom.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:45.340]   Okay, is because there is no natural alliance in the real world between China, Russia and
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:46.340]   Iran.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:52.140]   These are three very different regimes with different types of governments who naturally
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:54.220]   would not get along.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:55.220]   They would be adversaries.
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:00.600]   Naturally, they'd be suspicious of each other as China and Russia were during the Cold War.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.080]   But we have pushed them closer together.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.460]   This is the problem with having this overly moralistic view of foreign policy.
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:08.460]   Over to you, Jason.
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.460]   What do you think?
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:10.460]   Tell us your question.
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.460]   Your question.
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:12.460]   What's your question?
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.220]   Yeah, I mean, you frame it as the Legion of Doom.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:16.220]   So just explain.
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:21.080]   Well, it's the axis of evil, the the 50% of the
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:28.520]   brainiac would not be working together if it weren't for declaring a war on both of
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:29.520]   them.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:36.840]   So essentially, Pakistan, Iran, and China work together on nuclear technology.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.500]   So they do when it's convenient for them work on things like nuclear bombs.
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.500]   So there is an affiliation, but you're correct there.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:51.420]   They're the 50% of the planet of humans on this planet who live under authoritarians.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:54.620]   And so they, they're authoritarians, they're always going to think in their own interest,
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:58.260]   they're always going to think in their own interest above their own peoples, let alone
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:01.980]   the people of another country, they don't care, they don't care about human rights,
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.060]   they don't care about the rights of humans.
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.660]   And they certainly don't care about the rights of humans in another country.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:11.260]   And the West is on a noble mission to spread democracy in the world.
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:16.620]   And that is a noble thing worth fighting for, and is worth defending free countries from
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:21.060]   despots I know that you are a fan of these folks, sacks apparently, and you think they
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.620]   should be able to run amok, I will take the other side of it.
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.300]   I think the West should act in unison.
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:28.900]   The only criticism I have is that we're not acting in unison.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.900]   I would like to see the West instead of sending Biden to Ukraine.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:32.900]   Hold on.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:33.900]   Where do I say?
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:34.900]   I like to have 20.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.140]   You've talked enough, you just accused me of somehow being fans of these people.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:44.220]   Where did I ever say that I was a fan of Xi and China or Putin or the ayatollahs in Iran?
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.220]   Hold on.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:46.220]   You said we provoked Putin.
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.740]   Putin invaded another country.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.740]   Hold on.
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:49.740]   You said we caused it.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:53.540]   I said, hold on a second, hold on a second.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:57.460]   I am arguing for a geopolitical strategy that benefits the United States.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.140]   I'm on Team America.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:03.780]   And your policy of driving these people into an axis of evil is foolish for the reason
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:08.660]   I said, which is we are going to power up the Chinese economy so they are a much more
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:10.860]   formidable enemy to the United States.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.460]   That is the last thing we need to do.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.460]   Now with respect to-
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:14.460]   You've stated-
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:15.460]   Hold on a second.
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:16.460]   Let me finish.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.460]   You had a chance.
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:22.280]   With respect to Ukraine and Putin there, there's no question that Putin invaded, okay?
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280]   He is the aggressor.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.180]   However, the question you have to ask is why?
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:33.380]   And the fact of the matter is that first of all, we fomented a coup in Ukraine in 2014.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.260]   This is your democracy spreading that you like.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:39.420]   It's all of a sudden we got these NGOs and we got Victoria Nuland from the State Department
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.700]   in there basically fomenting these coups.
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.940]   It doesn't work out quite the way you think, Jay Kal.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.780]   That's problem number one, okay?
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.740]   Then we try to run NATO right up to Russia's border, okay?
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:53.220]   And you expect them just to accept that because we're a benevolent superpower.
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.380]   That's not the way the real world works.
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:57.920]   Putin was tremendously threatened by that and it wasn't just him.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.840]   It was all Russian elites.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.800]   Read the Bill Burns memo from 2008, "Yet means yet."
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.560]   He explains that even the liberal elements within Russia were tremendously threatened
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.320]   by NATO expansion.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.800]   That is what basically poisoned diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:17.000]   and it was a major cause of this war.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.860]   Now listen, just because you don't think it's provocative doesn't mean that the Russians
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:23.360]   don't think it's provocative.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.600]   You have to be able to put yourself in the other guy's shoes for just one second.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.320]   The fact of the matter is there were diplomatic steps that we could have taken to defuse this
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:35.160]   crisis in this war and we didn't do it and now look what's happened.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.040]   Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and Ukraine's been destroyed.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:39.040]   It's been absolutely destroyed.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.200]   Let me tell you right now, it looks like they're losing this war.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.920]   I don't see where your superhero policy has gotten us except to make China richer and
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.760]   more powerful and to destroy Ukraine.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.660]   That is where your naive idealism has gotten us.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:42:01.020]   Yeah, and I would say if you, if left to your devices and you're not engaging and not presenting
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:04.620]   a united front against Putin, he will invade country after country.
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.480]   The West must fight for democracy.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.440]   We must fight for human rights, even if it's uncomfortable and you seem to think we provoked
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.980]   him to invade this country.
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:18.700]   He's a murdering dictator, authoritarian who has been murdering his own people and other
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:22.980]   people for his entire career and he will continue to do so.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.060]   Let me clarify because you're putting words in my mouth.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.060]   Okay.
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:28.180]   When you say that, I think that we provoked him.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:33.180]   What I believe, what I believe is that we took actions that in Russian eyes were provocative.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.540]   Yeah, you said we provoked it.
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:39.460]   I'm saying that from their subjective point of view, they saw these actions as provocative.
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.460]   They said so.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:44.780]   Listen, the Russian elite, we provoked it is your position.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:47.340]   No, I just explained that's not the words I would use.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:51.100]   Still on his position is that in their eyes, they were provoked.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:58.060]   Jason, we're talking about, we're talking about and no, what you're doing right now
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:59.740]   is like dishonest.
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:02.260]   I just explained the language that I would use.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.260]   Yes, yes.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:04.500]   We provoke them.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.300]   We took actions that in Russian eyes were provocative.
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:08.300]   There's a difference.
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.300]   Provocative, provoked.
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.300]   Yes.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.300]   The act of provoking.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:12.300]   Stop lying.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.300]   Okay.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:14.300]   It's going to be too much.
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:15.300]   Okay, let's move on.
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:16.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:18.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:22.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:24.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:28.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:31.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:32.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:35.300]   Let's move on to the next one.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.300]   Now you're backsliding.
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:38.300]   Hold on.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:41.300]   You're backsliding right back to your legion of doom.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:46.800]   No, I believe the West should present a united front and we should hold the line with Russia
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.380]   invading other countries.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:49.380]   That's my belief.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.700]   I do not think we should be doing this solo.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:53.060]   I think we should not be sending Biden.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:56.780]   We should be sending 15 leaders of countries to Ukraine.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.660]   We should be sending people in and we should be doing a peace process.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:05.700]   And I think the military industrial complex, largely driven by the GOP is what's at fault
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.700]   here.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:07.700]   They want to use these weapons.
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:10.740]   They want to replenish the supply and they want to regime change.
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:12.060]   I don't think we should be going for regime change.
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.100]   I think we should be building bridges.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:14.100]   So do you?
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.420]   My point is a little more subtle.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.420]   You're doing it right there.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:21.460]   You're basically engaging in this ridiculous rhetoric that we've seen in the media, which
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:26.460]   is that if you simply want a more realistic American strategy, because you believe it
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:31.300]   benefits America, that you're automatically accused of somehow being a Putin sympathizer.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.820]   You're doing what the mainstream media has done.
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:33.820]   No, I'm not.
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:39.220]   I just said to you, it should be the entire West as a group, as a block negotiating with
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.220]   Putin.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:41.220]   What do you think?
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:43.540]   It's fine for Xi Jinping to be part of that.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:48.380]   I welcome Xi Jinping, Germany and the United States and France and the UK all getting together
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:50.340]   and trying to get these two parties to settle.
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.640]   What do you think we're doing?
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.740]   What do you think we're doing right or wrong with China right now?
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740]   Right or wrong?
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:01.740]   What do you think we're doing right and wrong or right wrong or I think we should be in
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:04.380]   discussions with them consistently.
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:06.220]   I don't believe we should be isolating them.
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:10.780]   I think we should be looking for areas we can collaborate on the environment, tech,
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:15.780]   technology, you agree with the chips act, you agree with basically on shoring and you're
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.420]   showing all the critical infrastructure we need is I think we should not be dependent
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:23.780]   on any foreign we should we should have energy security.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.780]   We should have metal security.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:27.380]   Of course, yes.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:31.500]   But I think every country should I think China should have that we should have it every country
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.280]   should aspire to be resilient and not be dependent on another country and being dependent on
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:42.220]   a dictator like Germany was on Putin, or we were with China for medicines or for, you
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.300]   know, medical equipment or tips.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.060]   We do not want to be in that position ever.
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:49.820]   One question just just on Ukraine, just for a second, Jake out, would you be willing in
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:55.020]   order to achieve a peace deal for Ukraine, would you be willing to agree to two things?
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:59.180]   Number one, that Ukraine would be a neutral country instead of part of NATO?
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:03.380]   And number two, that we would recognize for me being part of Russia, would you be willing
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.500]   to give those two things?
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.140]   I think that's up not up to me.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:09.780]   I think it's up to the people of Ukraine and Russia to sort this out.
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.900]   And it's up for the West to set the table for them to do it.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:16.820]   And part of setting the table for them to do it is to make it more painful for them
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:18.080]   to stay at this war.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.820]   So if they are told if you keep fighting over these things, and you don't come to a resolution
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:26.420]   between those two parties who have to live with that resolution, that is the uncomfortable
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.980]   thing that will force them.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:32.420]   And that could be China, us and India all working together, all of us working together
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:35.180]   to force those two parties into a solution that works for them.
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:38.340]   We have Brad for 10 minutes, I want to move on, I want to show you guys a tweet about
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.340]   Harvard students.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:43.500]   And I want you guys to react to Draymond's comments, because they're just fucking incredible.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:48.060]   I don't know if you guys saw this, but isn't that unbelievable?
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:53.900]   It says there was a study at Harvard that found that 43% of white students there are
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:59.680]   legacy athletes, or related to donors or staff.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:00.680]   That's unbelievable.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.500]   Is that public knowledge?
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.260]   Or is that like kind of leaked information?
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.260]   I wonder this is from Dolores Handy.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.580]   I don't know who that is.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:11.060]   Maybe we could click on who the source of that is.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.900]   legacies gotta go, right?
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.900]   That concept?
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.900]   Should I just go away?
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.380]   Yeah, is there a valid reason to have legacy?
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:22.720]   Is there a valid reason to have legacy?
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.020]   It feels unfair.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:29.060]   It feels un-American that these important institutions give preference to people who
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:34.220]   are stupider and achieve less if this is an achievement based system.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:35.220]   It just feels unfair.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:40.820]   Yeah, I mean, well, we know we know that the first class had 0%.
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.620]   So we know what the trend line looks like.
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.580]   So at some point, we're approaching 100%.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.300]   I think we're just debating what question right?
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:51.380]   One of the things I would like to see Chamath is what's the relative performance 10 years
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:56.380]   after graduation between the legacies and the kids who had to fucking scratch and fight
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.020]   to get into the place?
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.580]   Oh my god.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:01.900]   I mean, I think we know the answer.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:05.540]   Well, you would think there would be higher performers, the latter group, but you would
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:11.380]   also think that if legacy got you into Harvard, then the legacy and your career is going to
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.980]   get you into other things, right?
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:14.660]   You'll have the end in other places.
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:19.860]   They're the ones who are miserable and walking around, you know, rich and haven't achieved
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.860]   anything.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:28.380]   Yeah, listen, Saks didn't get into Stanford based on his dad's buying a building, right?
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.940]   That's for sure.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:34.180]   Okay, so here is a video from Treymung Green.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:38.480]   What I do want to go back to is Black History Month.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.780]   This is actually the first time you've seen me in a Black History Month shirt.
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:47.700]   All Black History Month and it's very intentional and I really just threw this shirt on because
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.020]   I didn't have another shirt to throw on.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:54.580]   But Black History Month, at some point, can we get rid of it?
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:49:01.620]   Like at some point?
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:05.300]   Why we got to keep getting the shortest month to celebrate our history?
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.620]   We got governors who want to take our history out of schools and I'm not going to be the
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:14.940]   fool to go say, "Yeah, we can celebrate it for 28 days."
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.420]   So at some point, I'd like to get rid of it.
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:21.820]   It's, you know, we're making all these changes in the world.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.820]   Can't talk about these people, can't talk about those people, can't say this, can't
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:26.380]   say that.
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:28.620]   At some point, it's time to get rid of Black History Month.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:35.460]   Now get rid of Black History like they're trying to do, but Black History Month?
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.460]   No.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:43.700]   Teach my history from January 1st to December 31st and then do it again and then again and
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:46.020]   then again and then again.
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.020]   That's what I like to see.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.020]   Wow.
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:49.020]   Strong.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.020]   So good.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.020]   Love that guy.
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:52.020]   Love that guy.
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:53.020]   He's the best.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.020]   He's the fucking best.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.020]   That was strong.
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.020]   He's the best.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.300]   I'm going to take the last 10 seconds of that.
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:59.820]   We all need to tweet that.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.500]   Yeah, be relentless.
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:05.620]   Chamath, there was a correction we needed to make about the Stripe chart last week.
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:06.620]   Go ahead.
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.620]   Yeah, so...
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:08.620]   You have the floor.
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:12.580]   We talked about some Stripe stuff last week and my analyst came to me after the show was
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:16.860]   published and there was a couple of miscalcs in the spreadsheet that generated the graphic,
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.140]   which big up to him for calling it out very quickly.
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.540]   Anyways, I just wanted to show you the updated one just so that we could make sure we get
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.540]   that on the record.
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:24.980]   I guess this would be a purple color.
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:25.980]   Is that purple?
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:26.980]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:29.980]   That's actually when you calculate net revenue and I think what [inaudible 00:10:00] did
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:32.620]   was calculated gross revenue, which is in the red.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:35.700]   So we showed this, but it actually should be purple.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:40.220]   So that's the updated, accurate version of the analysis.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.660]   So there you have it, folks.
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:46.820]   What does that mean for Stripe versus Adyen in terms of just... which is a better business,
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:47.820]   just to summarize it?
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:53.420]   No, I mean, to be honest with you, it says what we said before, which is that the previous
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:51:00.780]   valuation was very expectation heavy and the new valuation is definitely more in line,
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:08.180]   but still very rich relative to other companies who have large profitability and large growth
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:09.180]   rates.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:14.980]   I think that's the key takeaway, which is it's very hard to both have huge margins and
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:19.740]   grow at mediumly high double digit rates.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:25.700]   The few that can, Visa, MasterCard, and Adyen tend to trade at a very different valuation
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:27.580]   set than everything else.
[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.140]   And so I think that's the challenge for Stripe.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.100]   If they can do it, they'll be in that class.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.100]   Okay.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:38.100]   For the sultan of science doing his SPAC in New York, having an incredible dinner at Carbone
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:39.100]   right now.
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.100]   Can I say, can I say...
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.100]   Enjoy the vegetarian...
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:44.060]   I pre-tilted him.
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:45.380]   He texts into our group chat.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:46.380]   Don't do it.
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.380]   Don't do that.
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:48.380]   Don't do that.
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.380]   Don't do that.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.940]   Let me know if you want me to dial in and save the episode.
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.740]   My Insta reply, Gerstner's on fire.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:55.740]   We're all set.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:56.740]   Why would you do that to him?
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:57.740]   Unbelievable.
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:58.740]   It ruined his dinner.
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:51:59.740]   Unbelievable.
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:04.420]   He has to go find his safe place.
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:05.420]   He's irreplaceable.
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:08.780]   Except, you know, this episode is pretty good.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.780]   Pretty good.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:10.780]   Pretty good episode.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:11.780]   Pretty good.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:12.780]   Pretty.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.780]   Pretty.
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.780]   Pretty good.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:15.780]   We love you.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:16.780]   We love you, Sultan.
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:17.780]   Oh my God.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:20.780]   It wasn't a bad episode until J. Cal started ****ing again.
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.780]   The Legion of Doom, are you kidding me?
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.780]   Just like you strike January 6th.
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:27.900]   You can't strike words in English.
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.500]   You can't strike a single word.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:32.380]   You struck my single word last week when I called you out as a Trump voter.
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:36.620]   When J. Cal gets under pressure in a debate, he falls back on all the usual virtue-signaling
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.620]   and ****.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:38.620]   Oh yeah.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:40.620]   Okay.
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:41.620]   Who did you vote for in 2016, 2020?
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:42.620]   Be honest.
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:43.620]   See, like you're doing right now.
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:44.620]   Look at this.
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:45.620]   Oh God.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.620]   Did you vote for Hillary and Biden?
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:47.620]   You're pro-Putin.
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:52.100]   You know, there's actually a meme.
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:56.980]   There's a meme on Twitter that anyone who disagrees with me is Russian disinformation
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.980]   or pro-Putin.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:58.980]   I haven't seen that one yet.
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:52:59.980]   That's pretty funny.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:00.980]   That's basically you.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:01.980]   I don't think you're pro-Putin.
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:02.980]   I only try to make sure people understand.
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.980]   Okay, finally, correction.
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:04.980]   Thank you.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:09.980]   During this entire year of Ukraine, Ukraine, I say every time, to be clear, you're not
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.340]   saying Putin is right for invading Ukraine.
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:13.340]   And you're like, no, of course not.
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.340]   Oh God, just stop.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.340]   No, thank you for saying that.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.340]   I appreciate that.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.340]   I always try to say that.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.340]   He's making a correction.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:20.340]   It's a very nuanced discussion.
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:21.340]   It's a very nuanced discussion.
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:24.340]   Like we could, nobody's in favor of this war.
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:25.340]   Nobody.
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.340]   Nobody's in favor of it.
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:27.340]   Everybody's trying to resolve it.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:30.340]   I think we just have different views of what resolution looks like.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:36.340]   Did you guys read this crazy article in Bloomberg Businessweek about Praz-Michel, the founder
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:41.340]   of, the co-founder of the Fugees and his entanglement with the one MDB scandal?
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.340]   Did you read this article?
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:43.340]   No, I have no idea.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:44.340]   Here's how the article starts.
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:46.340]   I like the culture at the end.
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:49.340]   Let's put the tinfoil hats on and do culture at the end.
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:54.340]   His phone rings and it's a Chinese woman that says something like, you know, your cousin
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:56.340]   wants to meet you.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:00.340]   He goes to the Four Seasons where he gets a note that says, walk around the building
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:01.340]   twice to make sure you're not followed.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:08.340]   Goes back into the Four Seasons, gets a key card, goes upstairs into a room where they
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:12.340]   then escort him to a different room in a penthouse, take all of his phones and he meets with the
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:18.340]   vice chairman of security for China where that guy is asking for an introduction to
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:19.340]   Trump.
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:21.340]   It is, that's how the article starts.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.340]   It is incredible reading.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:26.340]   Incredible, incredible reading.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:28.340]   I encourage all of you to read it.
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:30.340]   It's so, what is it called?
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:31.340]   Juicy.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:32.340]   It's so juicy.
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.340]   Spicy.
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:38.340]   If you want to read some crazy story, there is a company called Wirecard in Germany and
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:42.340]   there's a New Yorker article about the biggest fraud in German history.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:45.340]   I highly recommend reading this one.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:49.340]   We didn't get to it today, but oh my God, if we had like a long reads post show, it
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.340]   would be incredible.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:54.340]   I personally don't think we should promote any stories by the mainstream media.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:56.340]   We have no idea whether they're true or not.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.340]   I mean, serious.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:58.340]   Gentlemen, we'll see you soon.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.340]   Thank you so much for filling in.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:01.340]   Love you, Brad.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.340]   Thanks, bro.
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:04.340]   Pretty, pretty good.
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.340]   Love you guys.
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:10.340]   I'm David Sachs, the pacifist of peace, the Sultan of science, Brad Gerstner, the dictator
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.340]   Chamath.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:16.340]   I'm the world's greatest moderator and speaker at your corporate event for 50 to 75 times.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.340]   Jake out.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:18.340]   Talk to my speaker bureau.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.340]   Let's get this gripped on people.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.340]   We'll see you next week.
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:22.340]   Bye bye.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:23.340]   Love you guys.
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:24.340]   Bye bye.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:25.340]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:26.340]   Rain Man David Sachs.
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:27.340]   And it says, we open source to the public.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:38.340]   And they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.340]   Love you, West Coast.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.340]   Queen of Kinwam.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.340]   Besties are gone.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:42.340]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:43.340]   Sachs.
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.340]   Oh, man.
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.340]   My avatar will meet me at Blitz.
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:46.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:50.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:52.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:53.340]   I'm going to be a part of it.
