[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500]   - Here in the United States,
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.540]   we've just finished up a brutal two weeks
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.640]   of presidential politics being the central focus
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.140]   of our society.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.840]   A week ago, it was the Republican National Convention.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.880]   Then this last week,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.780]   it was the Democratic National Convention.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.020]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.920]   this weekend, you're probably a little bit frustrated
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920]   at the state of politics.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.020]   Seems like most people are pretty frustrated
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.860]   at the state of politics.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.760]   So today, I'm gonna try to give you an antidote
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.460]   to worrying about political elections
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.860]   and presidential candidates and all of that
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.060]   by talking about how,
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.780]   although the politicians might want to be in control,
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.940]   you are actually the one who's in control.
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:32.660]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.660]   the show where we're focused on giving you the tools
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.600]   that you need to build a rich life now,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.100]   while also building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.280]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   Today, (laughs)
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.380]   hopefully a note of optimism in your day.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.120]   Don't worry, I'm not gonna talk to you about politics.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.920]   I'm gonna talk to you about freedom from politics,
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.220]   especially financial freedom from politics.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.360]   Desired outcome that I have for today's show
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840]   is that you will go away from this show
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   thinking about how much control that you really have,
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.080]   how much you really are in charge of your own life.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.420]   Because frankly, it's hard. (laughs)
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.220]   It's hard not to be a little bit depressed
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.360]   by current political events.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.660]   And if you're not listening to the United States,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.120]   the same thing will happen in your country.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.420]   It just might not be on the same schedule
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.560]   as it's happening here.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.720]   And this event, none of what I'm about to talk about
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.420]   is particularly related to the 2016 election cycle.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.160]   It just seems that there's more universal frustration
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.000]   and depression being reflected
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.740]   in this presidential election cycle
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.940]   here in the United States,
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700]   than in many others.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.080]   And the genesis of the idea for today's show
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.140]   came from an interaction that I had yesterday.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.940]   So short story, there are a couple of young boys
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.220]   here in my neighborhood, about eight, nine years old,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.560]   who have built a summer business for themselves,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.080]   going around and washing cars.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.460]   I'm very impressed with them.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.160]   They didn't, I live in a neighborhood
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   that we don't really have big lawns,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.700]   and it's kind of a, let's see,
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.540]   I guess I would call it
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.340]   kind of lower middle class neighborhood.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.540]   A lot of blue collar workers and whatnot living here.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.140]   It's very much a rental community.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.340]   And so these boys are from disadvantaged families
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.440]   and disadvantaged circumstances.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.540]   And in speaking with,
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.720]   and they built this little summer business.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.280]   They came one day, knocked on my door and said,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.960]   "Hey, would you like a car wash?"
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.260]   So they use my hose.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.980]   They bring around a bucket and some soap,
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.120]   and that's the extent of their equipment.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.060]   And they're going around and building the business.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.660]   And so I've encouraged them in their business.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.820]   I've tried to seek to give them
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.620]   a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of advice
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.300]   and how they can learn a little bit more.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.540]   But I really have a ton of respect for them.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.060]   And because they've been going out and building a business.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.980]   And so I've had them wash a few of my cars for me
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.340]   as a way to support them.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.140]   Well, yesterday afternoon, one of the boys comes by
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.080]   and my family and I were just getting back
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.920]   from our Sunday morning church meeting,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.980]   pulling into the driveway.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.620]   And one of them comes by and asks me
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.400]   if I'd like our minivan washed.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.340]   Now, they usually charge me 10 bucks for the minivan
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.900]   because it's a larger vehicle,
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.700]   and they do five bucks for the cars.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.740]   And so one of these young men said to me,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.380]   he said, "Hey, I'm trying to buy something.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.180]   "I'm trying to buy a bike lock for my bicycle
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.500]   "so it doesn't get stolen.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.160]   "So I need to earn a little bit of money.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   "Would you be willing to have me wash your car for five bucks
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.300]   "instead of the normal $10 rate?"
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.140]   I said, thought about it for a moment.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.000]   I said, "Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.940]   "A 50% discount is a pretty good discount in my book.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.540]   "I'll take that deal."
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.500]   So I moved the van over into the grass.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.660]   He washed the car for five bucks
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.380]   and gave him a little extra tip
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.900]   'cause it was a hot afternoon.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.100]   But, and it impressed me.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.180]   I saw him about an hour later
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.820]   and he was showing off his new bike lock
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.220]   that he'd purchased for his bike.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.700]   And it made me think about the financial circumstances
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.520]   that he faces.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.940]   Here's this young man, I don't know, maybe 10 years old.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.380]   He's, I think he's one of the older ones.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.100]   He's a great young man.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.540]   And he's got these goals that he has
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.760]   and he wants to buy this thing.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.680]   And first, there's a whole podcast there
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.080]   if I wanted to talk about just how impressed I am
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   that he is learning how to go and work for what he wants.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.780]   What a great lesson there.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.020]   He lives with an uncle.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.780]   He doesn't have, his parents aren't in his life.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.580]   He's got kind of a rough circumstance.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.940]   But he's learned that he's not helpless.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.780]   He can go and make business.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.660]   And then I was thinking about his ability
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.620]   to offer the deal to me.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.060]   And the fact that he was willing to work for cheaper
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.260]   than he normally would be willing to work for
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.460]   because he had something that he really wanted.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.380]   And I was thinking about all the ramifications of it.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.820]   Well, that turned me on to thinking about minimum wage laws
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.760]   which we face a interesting financial circumstance
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.940]   going into this election
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.420]   that it seems as though both
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.580]   of the major political candidates,
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.740]   obviously the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.020]   is in favor of increases in the minimum wage laws.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.700]   And then recently I observed that the Republican candidate,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.740]   Donald Trump, was also in favor of increases
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.660]   in the minimum wage laws.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.580]   So both of the presidential candidates
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.600]   are proposing and encouraging and promoting
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.180]   the increase in the minimum wage
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.180]   from what it currently is in the United States,
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.940]   federal minimum wage is $7.25
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.740]   and an increase in that range to some other number.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.900]   The number I believe I saw
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.380]   from the Donald Trump campaign was $10 an hour.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.380]   And so the minimum wage laws are interesting
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.380]   because I'm convinced they are tremendously harmful laws
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.540]   because they eliminate the people from the workforce
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.980]   who aren't particularly well-qualified for jobs.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.080]   They eliminate people like this young man
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.820]   here in my neighborhood who's not particularly skilled
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.260]   from being able to work.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.060]   Because I would not have accepted,
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.340]   I didn't really need the car washed,
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.440]   I wouldn't have accepted his offer
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.340]   of wanting to wash my car at an offer of 10 bucks.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.900]   That was more money than I wanted to spend
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.500]   for washing the car that didn't particularly need it
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.620]   all that badly.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.020]   But I was willing to accept his offer of five bucks.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.080]   And then because of his hard work,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.860]   I was thinking about other things
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.300]   that he could do around my house.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.420]   And I was considering that,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.180]   well, I wouldn't be willing to pay him the going rate
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.100]   for a laborer, which is about 10 bucks an hour
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.140]   here in my area, if I were gonna go and hire a day laborer
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.120]   from one of the labor pools here locally,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.820]   I would need to hire somebody at probably
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.940]   about 10 bucks an hour, and they'd be looking for
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.940]   at least about a five-hour workday,
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.220]   probably more about a seven-hour workday would be ideal,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.020]   and they'd prefer it to be longer.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.980]   I've hired day laborers,
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.820]   and that's pretty much the going rate.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.540]   So I don't have enough work where it's worth it to me
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.580]   to go and hire somebody for 10 bucks an hour,
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.060]   but I would be willing to pay this young man,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.700]   I don't know, five bucks an hour with a tip
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.180]   at the end of the day if he did a good job.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.060]   And I got some very simple work
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.620]   that's not particularly skillful, but would help me out.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.740]   But I would be barred, legally speaking,
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.260]   from making that transaction with him
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.700]   based upon the minimum wage laws.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.860]   So in considering it, however,
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.740]   I was considering how would I circumvent that law
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.820]   and do it legally so I could offer him
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.200]   what we did with the car wash.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.420]   I didn't track how much time it took him to do
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.000]   the car wash, we just simply made a contracted price
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.060]   that in exchange for a set rate,
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.480]   he would wash my car for me.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.600]   So thus, I didn't make a contract with him
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.860]   for an hourly rate, I made a contract with him
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.060]   for a contract rate.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.020]   And it's so relatively simple to get around something
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.860]   like a minimum wage law and establish a contract
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.380]   between two people to do the work.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.140]   So that little exchange, I tell you the back story
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.300]   just 'cause I think it's interesting
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.840]   and there's some ideas there for you, for your kids,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.060]   and I encourage you, encourage the young men and women
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.500]   in your neighborhood who are learning these skills.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.040]   But I was thinking about how in reality,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.260]   although the law might say one thing,
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.420]   I'm pretty free to come up with a different way
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.300]   of structuring things so that I can get around the law.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.100]   And the great thing is that most laws are like that.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.880]   And so today, if you've been a little depressed
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.960]   like I have been the last few weeks,
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.060]   if you're a little depressed paying attention
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.360]   to national politics, then here's my encouragement,
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   turn away from that and recognize some of the ways
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.300]   that I'm gonna go over in today's show
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.260]   of how ultimately it's your choices
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.740]   that will influence what you do.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.740]   And you always have the choice that this young man
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.020]   in my neighborhood had to make a free contract with somebody
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.020]   and agree to do a certain job for a certain rate of pay.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.940]   And that choice is yours.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.020]   And hopefully this empowerment will be conveyed
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.200]   through the message of today's show.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.180]   And some of the specific examples,
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.340]   I'm gonna focus a lot on taxes about how,
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.220]   that's one of the major areas
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.040]   where government influences our lives,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.980]   where they change our taxes and they increase our taxes
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.020]   and things like that,
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.260]   that you'll see that as incentives change, you can change.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.040]   And there's always a way where you can adjust
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.340]   and arrange your circumstances of your life
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.840]   in a manner that's going to be advantageous to you.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.140]   So we'll get to that in just a moment.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.260]   Sponsor of today's show is Paladin Registry.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260]   Paladin Registry is a financial advisor registry service
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.100]   where they go and do some of the upfront due diligence
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.460]   for you of vetting their financial advisors.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.780]   When you hire a financial advisor,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.260]   you need to do due diligence on that specific advisor.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.940]   Well, if you work through Paladin,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.660]   you still need to do your due diligence,
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.900]   but you can at least be confident
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.580]   that they have done some of the due diligence for you.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.780]   They check the advisor's disciplinary records,
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.380]   they've checked their business practices,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.080]   and they're making a referral to you
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.560]   of a vetted screened financial advisor.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.460]   If you'd like access to that type of advisor
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.700]   while you are initially starting your search
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.040]   for a new financial advisor or for a financial advisor,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.580]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin,
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.520]   fill in the form there,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.620]   and they will put you in touch with a couple of candidates.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.140]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:11.140]   Now, continuing with the stories here,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.980]   and I'm gonna give a little bit of stories
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.320]   just to get your creative mind thinking,
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.300]   and then we'll jump to the tactics.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.660]   I was also thinking about an article that I saw
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.100]   this morning in The Telegraph.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.820]   Quote, or excuse me, title of the,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.940]   try again, the title of The Artograph.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.180]   (laughing)
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.340]   The title of the article from The Telegraph in the UK
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.900]   is called "Britain Banishes Plastic Bags
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.900]   "as a 5 P Pence Tax Sees Usage Plummet by 6 Billion."
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.460]   Couple firsts of the leading paragraphs of it
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.340]   give you all the info you need.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.580]   "Britain has virtually banished plastic bags
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.000]   "just six months after the government
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.580]   "introduced a 5 P charge to discourage shoppers
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.260]   "from using them, official data has revealed.
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.500]   "According to figures released today
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.300]   "by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs,
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.100]   "shoppers are on track to use around 6 billion fewer
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.820]   "single-use plastic bags this year.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.760]   "Since the policy came into force in England in October 2015,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   "the total number of carrier bags used
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.640]   "at the UK's biggest retailers
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.100]   "has fallen by an estimated 85%.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.980]   "The total number used fell from over 7 billion a year
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.080]   "to less than half a billion
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.900]   "in the first six months of the policy,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.380]   "saving 40,801 tons of plastic,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.380]   "which is the equivalent weight of roughly 300 blue whales."
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.140]   So in short, they start this new tax on plastic bags
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.260]   and people stop using them.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.400]   And it's a really great story and an example of incentives
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.960]   and how incentives work.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.680]   Now, I, as a small government person,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.900]   I get a little bit frustrated
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.060]   by the government intervention here.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.740]   But the cool thing is that you don't have to wait
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.460]   on government coercion to do certain things.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.020]   If a business, any business wants to make a change,
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.360]   they can just simply do it
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.460]   with an intelligent system of incentives.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.020]   And the focus of today's show is incentives.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.060]   How has incentives changed?
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.940]   You change your actions.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.860]   For example, here in the United States,
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.700]   we have the grocery chain Aldi.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.020]   It's very popular among the frugal living cohort
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.380]   of US American residents.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.860]   And they've got great food at really great prices.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.100]   Well, they've got a few different ways
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.560]   that they keep their prices low.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.640]   One of the ways that they keep their prices low
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.900]   is by having fewer staff working
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.860]   and by lowering some of the expenses associated with this.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.940]   They got this really neat system,
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.460]   if you've never shopped at an Aldi,
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.820]   where in order to get a shopping cart,
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.220]   you put a quarter into a little device
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.860]   that will then dispense to you a shopping cart.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.780]   And then when you return your shopping cart
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.820]   to the front of the store, to the properly parked place,
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.740]   you'll receive your quarter back.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.340]   And a quarter is not particularly meaningful
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.780]   in most of our financial lives,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.340]   but it does the work of providing an incentive
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.500]   for you to take your cart from the parking lot
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.300]   and take it up to the front of the store.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.140]   Works really well.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.980]   When we go to the store, naturally,
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.140]   we try to make money anywhere we go.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.080]   We'll grab a few carts.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.580]   If there happen to be any in the parking lot,
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.500]   we'll bring them up.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.300]   I don't mind getting a few extra steps in return
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.900]   for 50 cents or a buck of extra money.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.420]   So we'll take the carts up and we'll get the quarters
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.780]   that are spit out from the machines.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.900]   And so it provides a really great system
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.580]   where Aldi doesn't have to have employees
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.280]   wandering around the parking lot, picking up carts,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.700]   but rather the customers will do that work for them
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.260]   because of a simple little incentive.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.620]   Aldi does the same thing with their plastic bags
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.460]   that if you want plastic bags,
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.580]   let's see, do they have them and you have to pay for them
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.620]   or do they just not have them at all?
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.460]   Don't remember, but the point is that
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.420]   if you are incentivized to bring your own bags.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.180]   The warehouse stores do a good job of this
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.340]   by offering lower prices and more self-service
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.980]   than they incentivize people to do without things
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.820]   like the bags and the bag systems.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.340]   So incentives work.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.480]   And these incentives are applied in every area of life.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.460]   Now let's bring it down to something specific,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.900]   something like taxes, which is where we focus
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.700]   a lot of our energy on this show.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.260]   Because taxes for most of us are our number one expense.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.280]   It might be number two for some of you,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.940]   but if you total all of the taxes that you pay
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.420]   in their various forms, from taxes on your cell phone bill
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.020]   to taxes on sales taxes to property taxes to income taxes,
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.020]   for most of us, taxes are the largest
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.840]   single category in our budget.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.420]   And there's a concept that I think is useful in taxation.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.740]   It's referred to as the Laffer curve.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.500]   Arthur Laffer is an economist and he came up with,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.540]   well, he didn't come up with the idea.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.000]   The idea has been around for a very, very long time.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.080]   But he popularized the idea as the mythology goes.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.420]   He wrote it on a, he was having,
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.340]   back in the 1974, he was having a meeting
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.260]   with President Ford's administrative officials,
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.180]   Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld,
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.580]   and he sketches this simple curve on a napkin.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.380]   So picture in your mind's eye an X, Y chart
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.660]   in an upward sloping curve that comes then down.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.900]   Kind of looks like a hill, a gently, smoothly sloping hill.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.660]   And the X axis is the tax rate,
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.500]   and the Y axis is the amount of government revenue.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   And the idea is that at the, some at 0% taxation,
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.220]   you have the lowest tax rate,
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.620]   but you also have the lowest amount
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.420]   of government revenue that's collected.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.080]   And as the percentage of taxation increases
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.220]   to a certain point at the top of the hill,
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.260]   then at that point you have the highest amount
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.740]   of government revenue that's collected at some tax rate.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.040]   And then as the tax rate continues to increase
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.180]   through that, say, 50% margin number to 100%,
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.280]   you'll eventually at 100% taxation
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.620]   have government revenue collection of 0%.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.220]   So we don't know where that ideal number is,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.020]   but in terms of maximum participation,
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.860]   maximum productivity, maximum government tax collection,
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.720]   and what that right rate is,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.540]   but we do know that it's somewhere between zero and 100.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.920]   Because if you had 100% taxation,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.460]   then basically the theory is that
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.820]   practically all economic activity would switch.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.060]   Or some people would argue that
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.860]   it would at least change forms
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.160]   from a form that can be tracked monetarily and financially
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.740]   to a form that can be in some other form, such as barter.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.100]   So that's the Laffer curve.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.100]   And this applies in taxation.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.100]   So it's a very difficult thing to figure out.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.440]   And that's where you try, there's always this balance.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.060]   And so you have traditional conservatives,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.920]   fiscal conservatives arguing that if you lower taxes,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.820]   you'll have an increase in revenues.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.740]   At lower tax rates,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.740]   you'll have an increase in government revenues
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.940]   because there'll be more economic activity
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.660]   because it's incentivized.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.120]   And then you have traditional liberals,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.520]   social liberals, excuse me, fiscal liberals,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.720]   arguing that if you increase tax rates,
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.020]   you'll increase government revenue collection
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.660]   because then everybody's paying their fair share.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.260]   And so you see some form of this
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.600]   generally reflected in most elections.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.860]   Well, the thing is, you don't have to worry
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.620]   about what the elected politicians have to worry about.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.160]   All you have to worry about is what you do
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.100]   in response to the changes that they make.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.980]   And the title of today's show is intentionally chosen,
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.100]   The Power of If,
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.460]   meaning that taxation schemes all work on the premise
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.420]   of if this, then that.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.560]   If you fall under these certain categories,
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.380]   then you'll pay these certain taxes.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.540]   But those are your options to pay.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.900]   And the reason that your options to pay
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.360]   is not because you can't be forced to pay a certain thing
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.180]   or do a certain thing
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.040]   because you participated in the activity,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.500]   but because your participation in the activity
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.160]   is voluntary.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.620]   A good example is I was preparing the outline
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.460]   for today's show,
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.660]   I stumbled across an account
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.020]   of something called the window tax.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.220]   A very interesting story.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.940]   It was reflected to show that people change
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.940]   their activities based upon a taxation.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.180]   So just the first paragraph here
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.260]   from the Wikipedia article on the window tax.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.140]   The window tax was a property tax
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.780]   based on the number of windows in a house.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.240]   It was a significant social, cultural,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.500]   and architectural force in England, France,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.920]   Ireland, and Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.440]   To avoid the tax, some houses from the period
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.160]   can be seen to have bricked up window spaces,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.540]   ready to be glazed or re-glazed at a later date.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.220]   In England and Wales, it was introduced in 1696
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.300]   and was repealed in 1851,
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.840]   156 years after first being introduced.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.700]   France and Scotland both had window taxes
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.920]   for similar reasons.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.900]   So the point here is that the taxes are based
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.880]   upon the number of windows in your house.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.740]   Well, if you've got a 20-window house
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.820]   and your tax rate would be substantially less
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.740]   if you had a 15-window house,
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.060]   you call up the bricklayer and you say,
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.540]   "Hey, we're gonna take a couple of these windows out
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.520]   "and put some bricks in their place.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.100]   "Now we have fewer windows."
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.260]   And that concept perfectly illustrates
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.000]   the choice that you have.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.460]   Now, whether it's a tax that's based upon your windows
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.380]   or whether it's a tax based upon the amount of money
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.460]   that you have, the concept applies.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.060]   On this show, I've demonstrated a lot of information
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.740]   and materials about how significant of a decision it is
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.380]   to live in one state versus another state.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.240]   And there are various offsetting forces,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.900]   but with regard to income taxes,
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   you need to seriously consider the state that you live in.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.260]   There was a story made famous back in the late 2000s
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.180]   with talking about the millionaire's tax in Maryland.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.180]   And it was, I'll read the first couple of paragraphs here
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.980]   from a CNN Money article from January, 2011.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.780]   Maryland millionaires will have a little more money
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.720]   in their pockets come 2011.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.540]   The state's 6.25% tax rate on income
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.580]   of more than $1 million will expire in the new year.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.800]   Maryland imposed the so-called millionaire's tax in 2008,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.740]   along with several other measures
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.940]   to help close a $1.7 billion budget gap.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.060]   I'm gonna pause for a moment in the story.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.220]   What happened, and this is debated,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.100]   I've read the debates and the rebuttals,
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.540]   but pretty confident that the data is accurate
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.340]   in this regard.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.980]   But what happened is that Maryland had a significant exodus
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.420]   of high income earning people
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.020]   when they increased the tax rate by that amount.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.780]   And that significant exodus significantly impacted
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.220]   their overall revenue collection.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.660]   So they increased the tax and their collection went down.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.020]   Now, there are people at this time, obviously,
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.220]   who went through a significant economic,
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.860]   significantly challenging economic crisis.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.340]   And so the rebuttals to this theory
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.060]   or this explanation of the data generally indicate,
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.020]   well, it's not based upon millionaires leaving Maryland.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.260]   It was based upon the economy.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.300]   It was based upon the fact
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.980]   that people were earning less money.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.060]   Perhaps there's some truth,
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.660]   but now I will continue with the article.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.100]   Remember this when you hear people, politicians,
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.660]   talking about, well, as a Democrat, I'm gonna say this,
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.820]   or as a Republican, I'm gonna say this.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.900]   And I'm gonna do this.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.420]   Remember, supposedly Republicans,
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   we're supposed to cut taxes and return it to the people,
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.980]   and Democrats supposedly we're gonna raise taxes
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.700]   and make taxes fair, continuing the article.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.020]   And governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.100]   does not intend to bring it back.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.820]   Instead, promising to wipe out a projected
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.820]   $1.2 billion budget gap with spending cuts.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.300]   Quote, "We can balance the budget through cuts
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.180]   "and without new taxes,"
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.780]   says Sean Adamek, O'Malley's press secretary.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.380]   Maryland is one of several states
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.100]   that levied millionaires' taxes to raise money
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.220]   amid the Great Recession.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.900]   Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.780]   raised taxes on higher earners in 2009.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.740]   Oregon did so this year.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.980]   You can read the article if you want to.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.900]   It's obviously out of date at this point.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.900]   But the point that I wanna draw your attention to
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.400]   is you have a Democratic governor
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.260]   who is sounding a whole lot like
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.740]   what Republicans used to sound like,
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.140]   saying that we can wipe out a $1.2 billion budget gap
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.420]   with spending cuts and there's no need to raise new taxes.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.220]   So if you think that the cause of the decrease
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.740]   in taxation and tax revenues collected
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.020]   was entirely based upon the economy,
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.980]   my guess here would be that the governor doesn't think so.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.060]   The governor is wishing he had a few more
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.420]   of those millionaires back in his state.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.760]   So when a government makes a change in the laws,
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.040]   you have a choice.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.140]   You can choose what you do.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.860]   You can choose how you respond.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.740]   And it's much healthier to focus on the choices
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.180]   that you can make in response to what's actually happening
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.620]   rather than worrying about how your vote is gonna change
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.780]   or not change what's actually gonna happen.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.420]   There might be a time to vote,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.100]   there might be a time to research that vote,
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.380]   but in general, it's far more empowering
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.260]   to spend your time focusing on what you can control
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.940]   rather than what you can't control.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.140]   You have no control over national political elections
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.300]   in the United States or in any country that you live in.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.780]   You have no control over statewide political elections
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.980]   in the United States or any election that you live in.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.540]   You might have a little bit of control
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.380]   at your county commission,
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.860]   and that might be worth your pursuing,
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.140]   but you have no control on the rest of it.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.740]   The good thing is that the power and the force
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.140]   of the free market is much stronger
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.140]   than the power and the force
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.260]   of a political system or ideology.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.500]   Exhibit A, Governor Martin O'Malley
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:10.140]   doesn't intend to bring his tax rate increase back
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.580]   because all of a sudden his tax base disappeared.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.580]   So don't worry about politics,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.500]   don't worry about the problem, sure,
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.260]   get involved if that's what you're interested in doing,
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.700]   but spend the time focusing on what you can control
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.900]   and take the power back,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.820]   and don't fall prey to the idea
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.340]   that because the Republicans think A, B, C, D, E,
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.540]   or the Democrats think X, Y, Z,
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.780]   that you don't have a choice.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.700]   You have a choice,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.220]   and you can always find a way to change your behavior
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.780]   in response to what happens and improve your situation.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:54.060]   At the simplest, you've got the black market.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.340]   We'll cover the black market at the end,
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.820]   but today I wanna just go through
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.500]   some specific examples for you,
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.820]   especially as they relate to finance.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.740]   Social issues are incredibly important.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.460]   Social issues have an if-then,
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.740]   and those impact finance,
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.740]   and those need to be discussed,
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.540]   but I'm not planning to talk about them today.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.900]   But I make decisions in my life
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.460]   that impact me financially because of the social issues.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.500]   But today let's focus on taxes.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.500]   So what do you do if a government increases taxes?
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.740]   Well, simple.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.140]   You make a choice to change your activity
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.860]   in such a way to reduce the impact of it.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.500]   So let's talk about income taxes.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.180]   Well, remember the fact that income taxes
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.860]   are a tax based upon income.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.420]   Sounds simple, but remember,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.260]   income taxes are a tax based on income.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.260]   So if you'd like to improve the problem
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.980]   of your income taxes, avoid earning income.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.620]   Couple different ways to do that.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.020]   Live on your savings.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.020]   So if you run into a period
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.300]   where the income taxes are very high,
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.980]   that's a good time to live on savings.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.620]   Borrow money.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.300]   You can live on borrowed money.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.220]   This is what real estate investors do constantly,
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.620]   where they borrow money,
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.140]   they use it to buy an asset,
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.460]   they take some of the borrowed money
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.380]   and they use it to spend on their own circumstance.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.220]   If the asset increases in value,
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.380]   they'll ultimately be able to pay the loan in the future,
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.060]   but their income is not taxed.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.540]   When you borrow money, you're not taxed on income.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.940]   You can also focus on gaining if you're being paid.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.020]   For example, if you're being taxed on wages,
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.580]   then you can switch to a different system of taxation.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.660]   You can switch to a system of capital gains.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.180]   So you can focus on growing the asset values.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.660]   If your income is being taxed very highly,
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.780]   but you look at your property and realize
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.700]   that well I could spend some of my time and energy
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.180]   improving this property, improving the value of it,
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.700]   and then I could sell it,
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.380]   and oh by the way, there happens to be an exclusion
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.140]   of $250,000 of capital gains
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.580]   for an individual filing singly,
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.660]   or a married couple $500,000 filing jointly.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.580]   You can avoid taxation on $500,000 of capital gains.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   A handy person, instead of working at a highly taxed
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.860]   wage earning job, might simply choose to focus
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.340]   on improving the value of their property,
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.740]   and then turning around and selling it,
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.400]   and taking that tax free income.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.260]   You might do this commercially.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.340]   You might buy houses and improve them and keep them,
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.340]   or build businesses and improve their value and keep them.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.780]   You can do this with various asset based businesses.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.200]   I've heard a story one time of a family
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.740]   who would build hotels, and they'd buy the property,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.000]   build the hotels, keep all the corporation.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.300]   They're keeping all these assets in their family,
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.200]   and now they have an asset value that's growing,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.120]   that they've done a lot of work to improve,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.900]   and they're not paying income taxes on the money.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.380]   You can do this with a business.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.980]   If you build a business and you substantially grow
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.460]   the value of that business, the business assets,
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.900]   you can defer much of your taxation for the future.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.880]   Then you can also make choices.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.980]   You can choose to move to a different state.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.900]   You can move to a different county.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.060]   You can always move to a different country.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:17.380]   You have a choice.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.460]   And so recognize that this choice goes two ways.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.460]   This choice serves as a natural restriction
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.580]   on the power of the government system,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.240]   meaning that in the United States,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.460]   if taxes grew too high, people like me
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.480]   who have a mobile business, I'd very quickly expatriate.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.260]   Many people would.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.740]   Many companies would.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.020]   Many companies are.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.980]   And so this serves as a natural restraint
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.260]   on a governmental system.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.340]   Doesn't mean it's always going to be successful.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.420]   Look at countries that destroy their economies
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.420]   by driving all the business people out.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.300]   It happens.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.340]   But it means that it's usually,
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.460]   for most thoughtful people,
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.820]   it's gonna serve as a restraint.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.020]   So the key is to always look and read the law
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.340]   and say, ah, here is a tax, or here's something I don't like.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.740]   What are the exceptions to this?
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.140]   What's the if statement?
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.660]   If income taxes.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.620]   What else?
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.740]   Social security taxes, a good example.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.780]   Okay, so we're gonna change social security taxes.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.500]   Well, what do you do to plan for that?
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.420]   Well, if you want to avoid the social security tax
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.380]   or minimize it, then you just simply need
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.940]   to earn your income in a way
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.440]   that's exempted from social security.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.860]   How do you do that?
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.620]   Well, you study the law and you understand.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.060]   Ah, social security taxes are employment taxes.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.200]   So what you need to do is simply avoid employment.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.160]   That means that you should earn your income
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.700]   through some other means.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.980]   Earn your income from interest or dividends or capital gains.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.620]   All of those are exempt from social security taxes.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.260]   Earn your income from rents or royalties
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.480]   on products that you've developed and are selling,
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.560]   books that you've written or intellectual property.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.260]   There are a couple of other interesting little tidbits
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.960]   to the social security tax.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.140]   If you're a student and earning student income
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.780]   that's being earned as an employee of a college
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.620]   or university while pursuing a degree,
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.020]   that income is exempt from social security taxes.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:22.300]   Also, if you are receiving scholarships or grant money,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.380]   that income is exempt from social security taxes.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.220]   So when I talk a lot about applying for scholarships,
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.660]   applying for grants, you should take that information
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.900]   and you should filter it and say,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.620]   ah, if I were working a job, I'd have to pay the 7.65%.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.420]   Excuse me, that's including Medicare as well.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.020]   You'd have to pay this six, what's the number?
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:46.340]   6.6-ish percent social security tax.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.220]   And so, now it's gonna bug me.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.620]   It's, Medicare tax is 1.45%, 7.65%.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.620]   So that means that the social security tax is,
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.780]   ah, I hit the wrong buttons.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.580]   6.2%, I think-ish.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.540]   Six-ish percent of tax, you have a 6% increase
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.220]   if you can get that scholarship.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.860]   And guess what else you're doing?
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.420]   If you get the scholarship income,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.540]   you're not earning wages.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.580]   So that's useful.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.580]   There's a lot of ways to compound that.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.500]   Why is it so beneficial for you to encourage
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.980]   your high school students applying
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.100]   for scholarships and grants?
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.420]   Because all of that money that they don't have to earn
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.340]   to pay for their tuition by working a job
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.020]   or by your working a job is gonna be much more efficient
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.100]   in the tax system.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.860]   Disability benefits or social security,
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.900]   remember that only applies to the wage base.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.300]   You have exempt wages.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.260]   So the social security wage base in 2016 is $118,500.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.700]   So if you were at $118,000 annual income,
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.180]   planning for social security taxes
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.100]   should be pretty high on your list.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.340]   If you're at a $818,000 income,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.540]   then social security wage taxes
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.720]   are an insignificant factor for you.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.420]   What else?
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.580]   Well, if you don't like the sales taxes
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.380]   and the sales tax rates, just avoid them.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.380]   Simple ways, buy used.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.340]   Buy from a place that doesn't collect sales taxes.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.900]   It used to be a major reason to patronize Amazon.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.300]   Now I think it's a reason to patronize other retailers,
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.820]   online retailers other than Amazon,
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.420]   now that Amazon is participating in the sales tax systems.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.500]   Or just simply buy used in the private market.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.240]   Look at your property taxes.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.380]   Choose where you live carefully.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.340]   There are disparities in property taxes.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.380]   If property taxes were to go too high,
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.620]   then people will make significant decisions
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.780]   and move to a different county
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.180]   or move to a different state.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.240]   Or if property taxes were to go too high,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.980]   people would respond just like they did in the window tax
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.180]   and choose not to improve the property value.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.300]   All of a sudden, they would go to living in mobile structures
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.620]   or temporary structures instead of permanent structures.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.380]   You would figure out instead of building a barn,
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.580]   I'm gonna figure out the housing needs
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.980]   for my livestock in some other way.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.760]   Or I'm gonna figure out the housing needs
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.820]   for myself in some other way.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.400]   And if you start reading the laws,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.060]   you'll find all kinds of interesting little exemptions.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.740]   For example, here in Florida, if you wanna own a boat
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.740]   and if you wanna save money on your boating fees,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.020]   now, it's gotta be an older boat,
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.940]   but antique vessels in Florida,
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.460]   meaning that the hull and the engine
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.500]   are older than 30 years old, don't pay registration fees.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.640]   If you go back and you think about the boating marketplace,
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.140]   you could probably find a vessel that was 30 years old
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   and have a significant high-quality vessel still
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.180]   that can help you to avoid the registration fees.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.060]   Now, maybe not.
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.020]   At the end of the day, you calculate the money
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:43.840]   and you figure out,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.740]   is this an important dollar figure in my life?
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.740]   And it'd be silly, don't be penny wise and pound foolish.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.260]   Don't spend all your time buying a 30-year-old boat
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.440]   and then living in an expensive high-income tax state.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.220]   But you can make these choices.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.180]   That's my point.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.900]   Hotel taxes, parking taxes.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.260]   I avoid places in town here in West Palm Beach
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.800]   where the parking is ridiculous, and most people do.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.060]   So as the market regulates, and as the tax systems change,
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.440]   as the incentives change,
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.000]   you can change your own personal approach.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.300]   That puts the power back in your hands.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.820]   You have the choice.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:32.580]   So today, I encourage you, take control.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.640]   Recognize that there are often exemptions
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.940]   and you have a choice over the activities that you're doing.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.340]   If you don't wanna be subject to a law,
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:49.220]   change your circumstances so you're not subject to it.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:55.100]   Focus on the things that you can do,
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.820]   not on the things that you can't control.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.120]   And I think your potential for happiness will be far higher.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.100]   Sitting around and stewing about political events
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.940]   and talking about how bad things are,
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.820]   it's a good recipe for depression.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.300]   Trust me, I get there.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.680]   I've worked very hard not to pay attention to politics,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.580]   and yet I still have that interest.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.940]   And so it creeps in, and if I don't exercise discipline,
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.100]   and I didn't exercise my discipline the last few weeks,
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.620]   I started to pay attention, I started to get involved,
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.180]   and I just get sucked in,
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.720]   and it just destroys the joy out of life.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.540]   And when I recognize that happening,
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.740]   I say, okay, time to walk away.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.580]   Dump it all away, I can't do anything about that.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.120]   But I can do something about what I do.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.420]   Very simple concepts.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.360]   Circle of concern and circle of control.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.100]   There are many things that you're concerned about.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.940]   Your circle of concern is very high.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.980]   Excuse me, very big, very big.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.920]   I'm concerned about taxes, I'm concerned about the weather,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.280]   I'm concerned about my family,
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.900]   I'm concerned about my neighbor,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.540]   I'm concerned about the general direction of Florida,
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.460]   I'm concerned about changing levels of sea level in Florida,
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.020]   I'm concerned about all kinds of things.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:10.220]   But I can't control most of those things.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:15.460]   And misery can be found in focusing
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.260]   on your circle of concern
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.500]   rather than your circle of control.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.300]   Circle of control is much smaller,
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.460]   and it's located within, usually, the circle of concern,
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.280]   but it's much smaller.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.740]   It's the things you can actually affect.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.020]   Can't do anything about changing levels of sea level
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.740]   on the Florida coast.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.740]   I can't do anything about the tax rates,
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.620]   but I can do something about my choices.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.640]   I can do something about where I live.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:51.100]   I can do something about how I earn my income.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:56.900]   And I couldn't do anything about the laws
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.900]   regulating me and my ability to communicate with you
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.940]   being a licensed financial advisor.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.420]   Can't change those laws.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:12.260]   But I can change the authority those laws have over me.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:17.780]   I encourage the same to you.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.820]   Focus on your circle of control,
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.580]   the things that you can actually do something about.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.660]   And then over time, as you focus on the things
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.360]   that you can do something about,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.820]   your circle of control will steadily expand.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.500]   And more and more things that are simply
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.220]   in your circle of concern will slowly
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.060]   come under the jurisdiction of your circle of control.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.320]   But if you do it the other way around,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.880]   it's a good recipe for misery.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.220]   Hope these few thoughts are encouraging to you here.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.960]   We live in interesting times.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.080]   (laughs)
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.000]   Interesting times.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.560]   And my hope is that Radical Personal Finance
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.560]   can serve for you as a voice of encouragement,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.880]   a voice of motivation, a voice of, I guess, encouragement.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.840]   And in order to do that, I gotta practice what I preach.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.140]   I've gotta stay focused on the things that I can affect.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.640]   But make a habit, and that's my outcome of today's show,
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.360]   make a habit of reading the if statements
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.440]   and then seeing how they can apply to you.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.720]   Much of life is about incentives.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.960]   When you understand the incentives that govern our lives,
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.680]   then you can understand a little bit more
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.560]   about our behavior.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.440]   And so understand the incentives,
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.520]   understand the things that are affecting you,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.060]   and then make good decisions in your own life.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.120]   That's it for today's show.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.520]   Thank you all for listening today.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.880]   Couple of quick closing announcements.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.320]   Tomorrow's show will be an interview
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.960]   with a listener of the show who's an Indian immigrant.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.640]   He heard me, listeners, Manhar Patel,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.960]   excuse me, Manhar Patel,
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.280]   and he emailed me and said,
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.120]   "Joshua, I heard you said you like to talk to immigrants."
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.720]   And he's got a great immigrant story,
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.960]   immigrated to the United States from India,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.480]   has been here for a number of years.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.760]   He's still working to establish his career.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.360]   It's just a fun, interesting interview with a listener.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.440]   And I think you'll be impressed and encouraged
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.000]   by how much progress he's able to make
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.440]   even though he faces dramatic difficulties.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.320]   He's a credentialed physician,
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.080]   but he can't get into the medical market
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.400]   as working as a doctor.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.520]   But I think you'll still be impressed
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.080]   with the progress that he's made in his life.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.040]   It is a fun interview.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.700]   Wednesday, I plan to talk to you about,
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.280]   this is my intention,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.620]   is to talk to you about various types of business entities.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.720]   We're gonna talk about sole proprietorships,
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.240]   partnerships, LLCs, C-Corps, S-Corps.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.320]   I'm gonna cover this, all the data,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.040]   all the business trusts,
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.720]   all this stuff from the CFP curriculum.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.680]   Thursday, I got an interview planned as well,
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.920]   and then Friday, Q&A.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.280]   If you'd like to support the show,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.640]   I would greatly appreciate that,

[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.600]   If you'd like to speak with me
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.360]   about any particular consulting,
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.480]   area of consulting I might be able to serve you with,
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.720]   feel free to book a phone call with me

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.940]   Be back with you tomorrow.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.520]   (upbeat music)
