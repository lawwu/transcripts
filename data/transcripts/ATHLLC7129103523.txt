[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.360]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.960]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.600]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and each week I sit down with the world's best
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   experts to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.000]   Today, I'm talking with Sam Dogan, known online as The Financial Samurai.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.720]   His website is one of the top personal finance destinations with over a
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.040]   million visitors each month.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.880]   He's been writing there for over a decade and there is so much good content.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.480]   The first time I found myself on your site, I think I ended up with at least 50
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.880]   tabs open and I've read them for hours.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.200]   And this summer, his first traditionally published book came out called Buy This,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.720]   Not That, How to Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.200]   And it's already a Wall Street Journal bestseller.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.240]   He wrote the book to try to take the guesswork out of financial planning and
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.880]   shows readers exactly what to buy, how much to spend, and how to optimize every
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.000]   dollar they earn so they can maximize their wealth building and live life on
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.760]   their terms.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   We're going to talk about the seven core principles of a financial samurai, how
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.000]   Sam engineered his own layoff and the principles you can use to do it yourself
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.960]   if you're thinking about changing jobs, how real estate can be a big source of
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.760]   passive income without actually needing to collect and manage dozens of rental
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.600]   properties around the globe, why we should all consider having our own online
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.680]   real estate, small business, or even side hustle, his 70/30 rule for decision
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.000]   making, especially when it comes to taking risk.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.840]   And because Sam is a few years ahead of me in the parenting journey, I have a few
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.520]   questions on that topic as well.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.960]   So let's get started.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.880]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.720]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.440]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.280]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.800]   Sam, congrats on the bestseller.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.800]   Hey, thanks so much for having me.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.000]   It's an honor and I appreciate the intro.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.680]   You write a lot about money, but like you do in the book, I want to start with
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.160]   talking about the point of all these financial optimizations.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.920]   Surely it's not just to be a Scrooge McDuck sleeping on a pile of cash, right?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.000]   If money is a means to the end, what is that end?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.320]   You know, that's absolutely right.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.200]   The reason why money is not the end goal is because it's just a tool.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   It's just a made up tool to help try to buy things that will
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.520]   provide for a better lifestyle.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.240]   If money was an object, the sole object for me, I would have kept on working in
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.160]   banking after my 34th birthday, but I decided enough was enough.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.280]   I didn't like it anymore.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   After the 10th year and after the global financial crisis, I was like, this is not
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.560]   really what I want to be doing with my life.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.040]   I wanted to have more purpose.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.600]   I wanted to feel that I was helping people, just regular people more.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.520]   So I left.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.640]   I left in 2012 at the age of 34 and I haven't been back to a day job since.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.240]   You define happiness as progress.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.760]   Is that right?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.880]   That is my one word definition of happiness.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.560]   Progress.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.840]   Whether it's progress in your finances, in your relationship with your significant
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.760]   other, with your children, with a hobby that you're trying to get better at.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.920]   Progress is my one word definition of happiness.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.640]   Is that the end goal is just making progress towards all the things you care
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.160]   about, is that how you view what money allows you to do or what life's for?
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.800]   It's like one of those interview questions.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.480]   Like, what is that one word, right?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.400]   So that would be my word, but I don't know if that's the end goal.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.200]   I think we always need to try to improve ourselves in whatever endeavor we take on.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.240]   We should probably try to challenge ourselves in something that's a little
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   bit scary, a little bit impossible sounding so that at least we don't look
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.280]   back with regret, having not tried our best or having not tried at all.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.040]   I want to go back to you.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.440]   You started down this road of being 34 and leaving your day job.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.200]   I know you engineered a layoff to leave that job.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.240]   And I know you've actually written a book with now five
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.720]   editions about doing that.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.440]   So first, how did you know that an alternate path would be the
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.720]   right move for your career?
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.680]   And then I also want to get to how others can use some of those tactics
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.000]   to engineer their own layoffs.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.360]   I started Financial Samurai July, 2009.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.280]   That was literally the bottom of the global financial crisis.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.240]   I'd lost 35% of my net worth in six months.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.640]   That took 10 years to accumulate.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.600]   So I was really bummed out and I had graduated from business school
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   part-time in 2006 and wanted to start Financial Samurai, but I didn't
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.880]   because I always had these excuses not to.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.640]   I said, I want to go give back to my firm because they paid for
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.320]   80 plus percent of my tuition.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.520]   Let's just focus.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.440]   But then when the global financial crisis hit, I was thinking
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   to myself, man, I need a backup.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.880]   I need to start doing something new so that if I were to get laid
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.800]   off, I could write on Financial Samurai.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.080]   And so Financial Samurai gave me that purpose, do something new to
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.960]   find something that I was passionate about, which was writing and
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.120]   connecting with people all over the world.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.600]   And it was in October, November, 2011, the year before I left banking
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.360]   for good, where I was in Santorini, Greece and it was 78 degrees sunny.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.000]   I was hiking up the crater and for two hours, and then suddenly I was like,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.440]   oh, there's like a nice bar with wifi.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.320]   I was like, oh, let's have a beer.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.080]   And there's an eight euro Mithos beer.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.120]   I was like, wow, that's expensive, but give me one.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.640]   How often am I going to go back to Santorini at the top of the crater?
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.360]   And in my inbox on my phone was a email from this advertising
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.680]   client in the United Kingdom.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   And he said, hey, Sam, I want to advertise on your website.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.880]   I'll put up this link and I'll pay you.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.520]   I think it was $1,100.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.320]   I said, oh, $1,100.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.920]   I'm actually closer to you right now than I am when I was in San Francisco.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.280]   So, I was like, okay, send me the code.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.440]   I will try to put it up on my phone.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.280]   And it was still pretty novel at the time, right?
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.880]   2011, iPhone, wifi.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.920]   And then within 30 minutes, he PayPal'd 1,100 bucks.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.520]   And I was thinking to myself, whoa, that's good money.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.120]   And I was like, give me another beer.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   And that was when I thought, ah, there could be a life after banking and I enjoyed
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.360]   writing and I knew I wouldn't starve if I was able to negotiate a severance.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.120]   So, there's two components there.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.400]   One I want to ask is, did you actually, when you decided to leave, get Financial
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.080]   Samurai to a place that it was going to replace your job or did you more just get
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.040]   it to a place that you saw an opportunity to do something different?
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.920]   So, my goal, first of all, was to save and invest at least 50% of my
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.720]   after-tax income every year until age 40.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.320]   But I didn't last till age 40, I lasted until age 34.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.640]   And the reason why was because I was able to negotiate a severance because during
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.760]   the global financial crisis, you know, talk about making lemonade, I saw many
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.120]   people get laid off and some of them were my friends.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.760]   So, I asked them, "Hey, is everything okay?
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   Can I help you find a job?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.240]   Do you want to interview with me?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.440]   You know, I'm still surviving."
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.400]   And a lot of them were thankful and we tried, but I also asked them, "Are they
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:29.760]   okay?"
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.240]   And they said, "Yeah, I'm okay because I got a severance equal to two to three
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.000]   weeks per year work, two to three weeks worth of pay."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.760]   And that was when I realized, "Oh, well, come 2012, I will have been at my
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.400]   previous firm Credit Suisse for 11 years.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.920]   So, if they gave me two to three weeks worth of severance, that's 22 to 33
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.040]   weeks, and if they could give me my deferred compensation because I was an
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.720]   executive director then and I had three years of deferred compensation in stock
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   and cash and a private investment that they made us buy in 2010, which were full
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.560]   of those "toxic assets", if I could get that severance and all my deferred
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.200]   compensation, there was no reason why I shouldn't take that leap of faith
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.240]   because it bought years of living expenses.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.960]   Now, most people listening to this are not - I mean, hopefully we aren't in the
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.600]   middle of a global financial crisis, maybe just like a minor recession.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.440]   But are the tactics you use something that anyone could use or are they really
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.720]   dialed into, "I'm in the financial company in the middle of a financial crisis?"
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.520]   Yes, these are the tactics that anybody in any organization can use.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.080]   Because the biggest pushback I have is why would anybody give me a severance
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.040]   if I'm a decent employee, right?
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.120]   I'm great, whatever.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.640]   The point is, if you want to leave anyway and your heart is not into it, your
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.320]   employer doesn't really want you, they want someone who's hungry, who wants to
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.080]   do their best to stay overtime, do whatever and if you are a manager in this
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.760]   environment, still in this environment, it is very hard to find a replacement.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.120]   It could take three months, six months and once you find the replacement, it
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.880]   could take three to six months to train them to be up to par with your level.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.680]   And so, if you say, "Peace out, see you later, two weeks notice", you actually
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.640]   leave your colleagues and your manager in a lurch, they're going to be scrambling
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.320]   to find your replacement and they're going to be suffering while they're
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.560]   looking for your replacement.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.440]   And so, the idea of negotiating severance is to think about the classic win-win
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.360]   scenario, how can you help your colleagues and your manager find your
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.320]   replacement, provide seamless transition during that replacement finding and
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.880]   train them so that when you leave, hopefully they'll save money and they'll
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.640]   replace you with someone who's hungrier, cheaper and just more motivated in
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.040]   general.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.240]   And so, that's the simple trade-off, it's I'm going to help you make this
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.120]   transition easy and in return, you're going to give me money or vested stock
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   or something and how have you seen that work?
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.400]   I'm sure you've gotten readers write back, say, "This worked, it didn't work",
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.720]   what's the kind of hit rate?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.680]   The hit rate is high, it's like 80 plus percent and a lot of people just come
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.120]   back to me and say, "I cannot believe I was able to leave on my terms".
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.960]   I mean, a severance can not only be just a severance check but it can be, "Hey,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.520]   how about work three days a week out of five and we'll still pay you the same
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.120]   amount of money?"
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.400]   So, if you're working 40% less, that's kind of like getting a 60% raise.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.600]   If you do that for six months, a lot of people will be like, "Hey, I'll take
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.440]   that, I mean, that's pretty good, don't have to work for two days a week, shut
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.600]   it off and do my own thing".
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.040]   So, it's really great and a lot of people have just surprised and shocked by how
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.240]   they were able to negotiate something that they thought was not possible.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.120]   And in this day and age, I think the reason why a lot of people will ghost
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.160]   people on the phone, text message, email or not, you know, they want to just
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.720]   break up over the phone is because they're afraid of confrontation.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.760]   And that's, I would say like natural but it's also kind of cowardly, right?
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.560]   You want to face your oppressor, you want to face the people who could help
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.000]   you and say, "Look, these are my reasons for leaving, I've been a loyal soldier".
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.720]   And the other thing is companies are afraid of backlash.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.200]   This is one of the things that companies are really afraid of.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.240]   There's social media, there's bloggers, you can blow up a company online and say
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.280]   like a lot of bad things and like a tell-all, that's the last thing a company
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.240]   wants, that's reputational damage.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.200]   And so, companies understand this, they don't want to get into a long litigation
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.320]   process, they don't want to get their reputation smeared, so they want to work
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.520]   with employees who've actually been there for at least a couple of years, three
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.480]   years, and try to come up with a win-win scenario.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.240]   Is that metric that you had at Credit Suisse of two to three weeks pay for every
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.400]   year worked, is that a general benchmark that kind of still applies or what do you
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.520]   think is a broadly applicable benchmark for a severance package?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.120]   One to three weeks and three weeks being at the high end, maybe four weeks, but
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.200]   it's usually one to three weeks and there's one thing that people don't really
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.840]   understand and that is to differentiate between the Warn Act, which is a worker
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.160]   adjustment training notification and a severance.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.880]   So, Warn Act pay is reserved for larger companies, usually I think it's in the
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.120]   hundreds or thousands of people and they do a mass layoff, they're mandated by law
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.000]   to provide one to three months of pay, that's by law, mandatory, whereas a
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.240]   severance is optional.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.960]   A severance is the company can pay you or they won't pay you, right?
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   And so, the idea is a lot of people who get two months, they think it's severance,
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.640]   but it's actually mandatory Warn Act pay, severance goes above and beyond that.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.800]   I know there are a lot of people listening who might want to use some of these
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   tactics, so I'll link the book in the show notes because we're not going to spend a
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.400]   whole episode on how to engineer layoff, though I'm sure we could and can people
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.720]   reach out if they have questions or how do you feel about comments and feedback?
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.240]   So, yeah, just go check out financialsamurai.com to buy How to
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   Engineer Layoff.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.600]   It's about severance negotiations and I also have a lot of articles online about
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.120]   severance negotiations for free.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.320]   So, you just Google "severance negotiation financial samurai", leave a
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.800]   comment and I'll be able to see it because I can see it from the back end and if you
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.280]   have a question, I can respond to it.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.280]   So, you end the new book with seven principles.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.120]   Is there one that stands above the rest?
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.600]   Well, the one core principle that I have held on to for as long as I can remember,
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.080]   maybe since middle school, is to never fail due to a lack of effort because effort
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.440]   requires no skill.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.760]   And this is really, really an important principle because life is not fair.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.160]   Some people have better advantages than you, wealthier parents, some people are
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.120]   stronger, naturally smarter.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   Whatever the case may be, the playing field is never, ever, ever fair and we have to
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.280]   accept that.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.680]   But if we never fail due to a lack of effort, that means we are always going to try
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.400]   our best and if we lose, it's not going to be because we didn't try our best.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.040]   It can be because the opponent was faster, quicker, smarter, whatever it is, more
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.640]   connected.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.680]   But if we do our best, we're always going to be satisfied and we'll never look back
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.720]   with regret having not tried our best.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.520]   Is there a reason why you chose to have seven principles?
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.680]   It seems like this is the core principle that you live by and have for a while.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.120]   Does it deserve to be elevated to be the core or what do you think about that?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.640]   Life is complicated.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.080]   There are a lot of different things and so, if you can adopt this core principle in
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.480]   everything you do, whether it's doing a podcast, writing at your job, raising a
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:51.800]   family, the key really is to - I just hate looking back on life with regret and if
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.280]   you've seen - what is that wonderful movie at the end, Inception or actually at the
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.440]   beginning, I don't want to be an old man full of regret, dying alone.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.760]   So, that's just the idea behind that core principle.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.160]   I also want to talk about the last one, about thinking in probabilities and not
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.880]   absolutes.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.600]   I know you have a framework for decision making.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.840]   I know you also are a big fan of Annie Duke's thinking in bets and I'll just
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.360]   preface that she's coming on the show next week, we're going to record an episode
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.440]   all about this, but I know you've adapted your own rule, the 70/30 rule and I'm
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.960]   curious how people can start to use that in their lives.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.600]   So, it is very important to think in probabilities and not absolutes, so you
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.680]   don't miss out on opportunities.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.360]   Think about if you had to feel you needed 100% certainty to make a decision, how
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.240]   many opportunities would pass you by, whether it's job opportunities, whether
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.760]   it's the girl or boy that you like, that you were too afraid to ask out because
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.920]   you were afraid of rejection.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   It's such a shame to have to think in 100% probability and if you think about
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.720]   it as an investor, investors don't think in 100% probabilities.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.920]   They think if I can get my investments right at least 51% of the time, I'm going
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.720]   to make a lot of money over decades.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.000]   And so, my idea is to create a 70/30 decision-making framework which states,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.600]   if you believe with a 70% probability or greater your decision is the correct one,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.280]   the right one, then go with it with 100% conviction while having the humility
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.400]   knowing that 30% of the time, hopefully less, you'll get it wrong and so long as
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.560]   you don't die or something catastrophic happens, you're going to learn from your
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.000]   mistakes and get better over time.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.360]   And so, your other question was, how do we hone that decision-making
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.920]   probability framework?
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.360]   And again, if you adopt everything with a probability matrix, it helps you in
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.320]   making better decisions.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.840]   For example, Golden State Warriors, right?
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.680]   Let's say it's NBA playoffs, you know, I love the Warriors and you start thinking
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.760]   about, okay, before the game starts, who's going to win and by how much and then
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.120]   after the game is over, you'll find out who won and by how much and then you will
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.320]   basically compare the results to your estimates and you will hone your skills
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.120]   over time and I think you'll be able to look at things in a probability matrix
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.640]   and get better.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.560]   And it's not just basketball or who's going to win the dog show or how long
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.760]   your friend's marriage is going to last or whether they get into college or
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.960]   whatever, it's everything.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.160]   Once you start looking at things in a probability matrix, things change and
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.560]   that is one of your key competitive advantages.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.080]   Is there a common financial decision that you think people make where adopting
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.040]   this framework would change the way they approach it in a positive way?
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   Well, I think as an investor, you have to be humble and you have to always accept
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.680]   that you will lose money.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.520]   That is the price you pay for putting money to work.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.440]   You will lose money, so accept that.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   And once you accept that loss, you will be okay once you finally do start losing
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.840]   money and I think that is the thing that a lot of people have a problem with and
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.160]   that's managing fear of allocating their capital towards something that could
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.640]   make them money or could lose them money because we all know the pain of losing
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.200]   money is greater than the joy of making money.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.480]   So it's being able to accept that loss and try to improve your investing
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.560]   probability going forward.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.360]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.040]   I get it.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.200]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.520]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.600]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.760]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.000]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.080]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.880]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.800]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.080]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.480]   list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.360]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.840]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.520]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.880]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.720]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.560]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.520]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.440]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.800]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:41.200]   I want to move on to another topic that I know is a big component of your
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   passive income, which is real estate.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   Seeing the internet of people talking about financial independence, it seems
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.360]   like everyone's goal is to just accrue more and more and more rental properties
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.320]   and then graduate to buy apartment complexes.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.720]   And I've always been someone who didn't want to manage being a landlord.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.000]   And so I've maybe gone the other direction, which is like real estate.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.520]   Let's just not focus on it much.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.560]   Yes, we own a home and some REITs, but then you kind of have this middle
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.440]   approach, at least my perspective from reading the book and your site.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.160]   And I'm just fascinated about finding a middle ground in having real estate
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   be a part of your portfolio without having to be a landlord, at least as much
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   of a landlord as some.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.920]   So the reason why I heavily invested in real estate was because I worked in
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.520]   equities, banking equities.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.040]   So my compensation, my promotion schedule, all that was tied to the stock market.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.400]   So 50% of every paycheck and 90% of every year in bonus was allocated towards real
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.360]   estates to diversify my network.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.200]   And essentially my framework and my recommendation to the average person is to
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.760]   get neutral real estate as soon as you believe you're going to be in one place
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.080]   for five, 10 years and neutral real estate just means owning your primary
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.560]   residence, it means you're going up and down with the market, you're short real
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.480]   estate, short if you're a renter, because you're a price taker of ever rising
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.360]   rents and as prices rise, property prices, you're also getting hurt because it
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   costs you more to buy if you ever want to buy.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.920]   The only way to be long real estate, not the only way, but the main way to be long
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.120]   real estate is to own more than one property.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.240]   That is the way you benefit from real estate appreciation because you can sell
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.720]   your rental property and you can collect rents.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.800]   And so my advice for people is to buy around age 30 or so and hopefully you
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.320]   have a stable job and you found a place you like to live in, to get neutral,
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.680]   live in it for three to five years, love it, enjoy it, accumulate that other
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.920]   down payment, buy another place, live in it for three to five years and do that
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.480]   over and over again, let's say up to your limit where you can no longer deal
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.840]   with managing tenants and property.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.320]   And that limit is different for everybody.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.480]   And that limit can go higher or lower depending on if you're comfortable
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.640]   hiring a property manager.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.600]   For me, I found that that limit was four properties, primary residence
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.680]   plus four, and that was it.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.200]   And they were all in San Francisco.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.400]   So I was highly leveraged San Francisco real estate in the economy.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:22.160]   But after I had my son in 2017, I just didn't want to manage that
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.520]   many properties anymore.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.480]   So I sold one, my main one, because there was a ton of turnover, a ton of
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:34.640]   problems, and I reinvested about 550,000 of the proceeds into private real
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.280]   estate deals, private real estate funds and syndication deals across the
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.920]   heartland of America, because I wanted some of the proceeds to continue to be
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.400]   allocated to real estate, but I really wanted to take advantage of my
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.720]   investment thesis that I came up with in 2016, which was to invest in the
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.840]   heartland of America, thanks to technology and thanks to people wanting
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.800]   to go to lower cost areas of the country to live a better life, save
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.080]   money and still make money.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.800]   And that was a great thesis.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.720]   And I got lucky in an unfortunate situation because the pandemic forced
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.080]   millions of people to work from home.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.280]   And so that accelerated that migration.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   And I think that's a multi-decade trend.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.760]   And so my plan is to invest more of my capital in my asset allocation
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.080]   framework of 50% to real estate, to more private real estate investments
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.280]   in the heartland, so I can diversify my real estate portfolio, earn more
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.360]   passive income and hopefully higher cap rates, higher net rental yields.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.240]   So I can live my life and not have to go back to work.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.760]   So if I want to summarize it, it's to get started, it's not about buying
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.280]   rental properties as much as it is when you buy a home that works for you.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.040]   And then when you outgrow that home, just don't sell it.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.240]   Assuming you have the money for another down payment and turn
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.360]   it into a rental property.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.200]   And it's not assuming it's being proactive and trying to save for
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.520]   a down payment for another home.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.720]   And the idea behind this is one, you enjoy your home.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.760]   You know, your home, the best, if you live in it for five years and
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.000]   if you enjoyed it, I'm sure other people enjoy it.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.520]   You'll probably paint it, do some things to make it nicer.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.560]   And the thing is, you're going to get a mortgage that is a primary
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.800]   residence mortgage that is lower than a rental property mortgage.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.360]   And you can keep that mortgage once you rent it out, you know, and that
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:24.400]   is a strategic advantage of buy about 0.25 to 0.5%, and then you're
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.640]   going to get another primary mortgage to buy other property in five years.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.280]   Maybe it's 10 years, maybe it takes 10 years.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.520]   And the idea is there's a benefit where you're not only building
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.320]   wealth through real estate, you're also using your capital
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.640]   to enjoy a better lifestyle.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.760]   Most of us are going to be making more money in our careers.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.160]   Some of us are going to grow our families and we're going to be able
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.440]   to appreciate the wealth that we're building and that's a win-win scenario,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.080]   which is why I like real estate better than stocks because you're not
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.400]   going to wake up one day seeing your stock go down 35% because it
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.880]   missed quarterly results by 3%, right?
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.360]   You're going to just enjoy your property.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   And I think the best time to own the nicest house you can afford is when
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.160]   you have the most number of heartbeats in your home and that's usually
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.040]   your kids because that way you can amortize the cost and the pleasure
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.720]   of owning a nicer home across more people.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.880]   And after they're gone, it's not like you're going to upgrade to a mega
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.040]   mansion, no, you're probably going to keep it because it'll feel lonely
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.560]   not having so many people in your house anymore, or you might downsize.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.160]   Tactical here, two things.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.560]   When you get a new mortgage, will they take into account the rental
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.360]   income of the house that you haven't started renting yet?
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.200]   That's a good question.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.000]   Hopefully what you're going to do is you're going to sign a lease.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.920]   This is the ideal scenario.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.960]   You sign a lease while you're in the process of buying your other
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.080]   home and that could take one to three months.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.560]   And once you have that rental income, they will not account
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.040]   for 100% of the rental income.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   Banks will generally account for about 70% of that rental income in terms
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.400]   of their calculation for how much they're going to lend you money
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.080]   for your second, third, fourth home.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.000]   So take that into consideration because banks will consider, OK,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.840]   if you're renting it out, there's going to be vacancy risk as well.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.440]   So they want to be conservative.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.440]   So they use 70%, which I think is fair, but I think regular mom and pop
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.040]   landlords can outperform that 70% and probably rent it out for 90 to 95%.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   And then I also know you're a fan of an adjustable rate mortgage.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.200]   Does that change with a strategy of turning your past
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.520]   properties into rental properties?
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.120]   No, so I didn't realize this, but only about 5% of mortgage
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.440]   holders have adjustable rate mortgages.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.560]   And I've been talking about getting an adjustable rate
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.600]   mortgage since I started in 2009.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.640]   And since I've been working in finance, well, since I bought my property in 2003.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.600]   And the idea is, look, interest rates
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.080]   and inflation have been coming down for 40 years in a row
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.400]   because of technological advances, efficiencies, learning about past cycles.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.520]   And yes, we currently have elevated inflation now due to a global pandemic.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.840]   But you are seeing inflation.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.400]   Top tick in July, and I think that's going to fade into 2023.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.320]   It's just the way it is.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.240]   Yin Yang finance, when prices are up, demand starts to get destroyed
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.760]   and then we get back to the normal steady state.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.640]   And so the idea with an arm is, look, you pay a lower rate than a 30 year fixed
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.320]   because of the time value of money.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.920]   If you're borrowing at a shorter fixed rate return,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.400]   the lender will lend to you at a lower rate.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.800]   And the thing is, back in the global financial crisis days,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.840]   the average home ownership tenure was about four and a half, five years.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.240]   Now, the average home ownership tenure ship is about 10 to 11 years.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.080]   The idea is you want to max your fixed rate duration of your mortgage
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.360]   with how long you plan to live in your home.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.320]   So to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage and pay 1% higher interest rate
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.320]   for 30 years doesn't make sense if you're planning on selling your home
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.040]   or refinancing or paying it off in 10, 11 years.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.200]   So that is the idea to help you save money and not be afraid
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.640]   of taking out an arm, because in my opinion, we're going to be in a long term,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.280]   low interest rate environment for the rest of our lifetimes.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.840]   So when we bought a home, we said,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.520]   we're probably not going to be here more than 10 years, let's do a 10 year arm.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.840]   Yeah, smart.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.080]   We moved out, we moved to a new home and we're like, well,
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.760]   we got three years left on the arm.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.440]   If I were to convert that to a rental, then I would go back to a point
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.520]   of adjustable rates.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.680]   So if you want to keep something forever and rent it after you live there,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.160]   then you really are more towards the 30 year cycle than the five or 10 year cycle.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.880]   That's true.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.480]   But in a declining interest rate environment over the past 40 years,
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.240]   what happens is your arm resets at the same rate or generally lower.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.920]   And that is basically what's been happening for 40 years.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.000]   So let's say so I took out a 7-1-1 arm in 2020, right?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.160]   So people are like, oh, that was a mistake.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   You could have got a 30 year fix for 30 years.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.960]   And I'm saying it's not a mistake because the 7-1-1 arm was at 2.125%.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:05.600]   The best 30 year fix rate I could get was about 2.875% maybe, or maybe 3%.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.320]   And by 2027, when the arm resets,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.640]   I'm pretty certain that it's going to reset at a same rate or lower
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.720]   because we're going to back down to trend in terms of inflation and interest.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.000]   So when an arm resets, it just generally resets back to the same rate
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.720]   or lower over the past 40 years.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.640]   Obviously, sometimes you can get unlucky.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.040]   But if you believe the trend is down or low, it'll be fine.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.680]   And an arm, people need to understand, has a maximum reset rate
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.960]   for the first year, usually by 2%.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.320]   So my arm rate could go from 2.125% to 4.125%.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.840]   To me, it's not a big deal because probably about 20%,
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.240]   25% of the principal has already been paid down.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.960]   And then the following year, it can only go up by a maximum of 1%.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.400]   And there's a lifetime cap to an arm, which mine is 7%, which sounds scary.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.080]   But for the first seven years of the arm, it was saving
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.680]   0.75 to 1% interest by not getting a 30 year fixed.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.400]   So you're only losing until like maybe year 10 or 11 or 12.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.640]   And it's not really losing.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.480]   It's just it was a suboptimal decision.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.640]   I built a comparison calculator
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.800]   to try to really dial in and optimize this particular thing.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.520]   And I found that it was about what you just said, two to three years
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.200]   till the break even point.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.040]   But I think it's rare to have interest rates be elevated,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.080]   at least in my opinion, and where we're going for more than a handful of years.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.200]   And so I would say if you have a 10 year arm and you're seven years into it
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.880]   and rates are low, probably a good time to refinance that.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.800]   Yeah, you can always refinance.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.320]   Yeah. So I think one common misconception is you don't have to wait
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.400]   until the end of the 10 year fixed period to do something about it.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.800]   So if you're seven years in and rates are still low, maybe refinance.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.880]   Then if you're nine years in and rates are really high
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.040]   and you haven't refinanced, we'll know that for the next three years,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.640]   you're still going to be breaking even from all the savings.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.200]   And hopefully that over that period of time, rates will drop again
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.960]   and you'll be able to do something.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.760]   The only other thing you didn't mention is
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.240]   I actually think that in periods right now we have high interest rates.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.240]   We have high inflation, but rents are also up.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.800]   And so if you're using your unadjustable rate mortgage for a rental property,
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   it's very possible that if your interest rates go up because of rates rising,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.720]   it might also be in line with a situation we have now, like inflation,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.480]   where rents are also rising.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.600]   And so you might be able to recoup some of that incremental interest
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   cost with higher rent.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.680]   Well, yeah, I mean, everybody needs to understand finance is not in a vacuum.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.360]   It's yin yang finance like inflation is up because the economy is great
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.960]   and job market is strong and people are getting paid more
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.880]   and rents are going up and so forth. Right.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.680]   But there is an inflection point and we need to be aware of that.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.520]   And that inflection point is probably right now.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.840]   And I think inflation is going to go back down.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.760]   So we're not helpless animals.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.280]   You're right.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.760]   We can refinance before the fixed rate period is over if we're afraid
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.360]   and we want to extend that term, or we can sell the property
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.800]   or we can pay down principal so that when we do refinance
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.720]   or when it does reset, less of the percentage goes to interest.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.680]   There are so many things we can do.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.400]   And that is a mindset that I want people to get into.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.880]   We are dynamic.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.600]   We always have an opportunity to do things to improve our financial situation.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.800]   I know you've had a lot of success in real estate.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.560]   I also know that you've talked about a vacation property
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.960]   that maybe wasn't the best decision.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.760]   So I'm curious to get your take on vacation properties.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.400]   So one, I think a vacation property is a suboptimal use of funds
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.240]   because you're not going to use it enough to be able to make it
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.400]   a good financial decision versus renting a VRBO or Airbnb or whatever.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:52.280]   Two, you want to diversify where you vacation.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.880]   You always go back to the same place over and over again.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.480]   It also gets boring.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.120]   But if you buy a vacation property, you're going to feel committed
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.520]   to having to go back to that place to make it worthwhile.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.120]   So I bought a vacation property.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.040]   Terrible timing in 2007 because I was making the most money ever
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.400]   and I just got promoted and I thought my income would just go up.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.880]   So the number one mistake I made was
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   modeling a high income for a long period of time.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.520]   And then I also thought I got a deal getting it for about 15% off.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   And then it ended up going down another 40 to 50%.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.720]   So that was a great lesson learned about not forecasting
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.560]   your income, extrapolating it so long into the future
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.240]   and also not buying things you really don't need.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.840]   But the good thing about this vacation property is that I kept paying the mortgage.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.360]   I paid it off. It's paid off.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.400]   And my dream for buying the vacation property was because I took my wife,
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.880]   my girlfriend at the time, I was on our first date in California
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.120]   to Lake Tahoe at the resort at Squaw Creek.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.880]   And I decided, you know what? It was such a special moment.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.800]   I wanted to own that piece of moment.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.440]   And one day, maybe we could take our children there.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.760]   And my forecasting for having children was very delayed.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.160]   But we just got back from the vacation property with our two children
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.840]   and they had an amazing time.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.440]   And it was really, really a priceless moment.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.600]   And now the vacation property is a very small percentage of my net worth.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.680]   So at the end of the day, I think it worked out.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.000]   And are you able to rent it out in the off time?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.080]   Something that maybe in 2007, the platforms didn't exist to make it easy,
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.480]   but now maybe makes the equation different.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   Oh, yeah. I mean, 2007 wasn't the Stone Ages.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.880]   It was in the rental program at the resort.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.280]   And then after several years, I decided to move it out
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.960]   to a private rental property manager.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.080]   And that, yeah, it generates 500,000 bucks a month pretty consistently.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.680]   I mean, it's high season during the summer and in the winters
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.960]   and then really sparse during October, November.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.040]   So actually, it generates passive income,
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.920]   but it wasn't a good financial decision at all.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.680]   And it was tough.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.200]   It was like that albatross on my neck for a while.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.560]   Like, I really had to fight it and get through it.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.240]   But now it's fine. It's just it is what it is.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.320]   It's part of the game of you win some, you lose some.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.600]   We recently looked at vacation properties in Napa, OK,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.200]   because there just aren't a lot of Airbnbs.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.680]   And we ended up buying a Picasso.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.840]   I don't know if you've looked at it.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.440]   It's like a fractional, fractional real estate.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.720]   So basically, you buy one eighth of a home.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.000]   So imagine it's as if eight people came together and bought a home together.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.360]   Except they have the marketplace so you don't have to find the other seven.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.320]   Right. Well, you'll probably enjoy it more than I enjoyed my Lake Tahoe
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.600]   probably because Sonoma and Napa is an hour and a half away.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.080]   Well, it's closer, right?
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.320]   So hope you enjoy it.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.640]   It's an hour and a half away.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.360]   Family is nearby.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.080]   And we only paid an eighth of it and we only get an eighth of the year,
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.360]   which means we only really use six weeks a year.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   But it's more efficient.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.800]   Yeah. Yes, it's much more efficient.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.840]   Quick interruption.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.960]   As you just heard, Amy and I bought a Picasso in Napa,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   and it was one of the fastest big purchases we've ever made,
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.760]   because as soon as we learned about it,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.120]   it just felt like the best way to buy and own a second home.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.480]   And it's been absolutely amazing.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.280]   In fact, ever since we closed, I've been trying to see
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.120]   if they would partner with the show, because as you all know,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.800]   I end up seeking out most of the brands I work with
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.560]   because I truly love their products and services.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.040]   And I only want to work with partners where I feel that way about the company.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.400]   Well, since recording this episode, I've actually partnered with them.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.560]   So while you'll hear more in a future episode,
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.040]   I just want to share that if you go to all the hacks dot com slash Picasso,
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.880]   you can get free early access to new listings and twenty five
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.960]   hundred dollars or more in closing credits.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:45.600]   That's all the hacks dot com slash Picasso P.A.C.A.S.O.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.120]   OK, back to the show.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.920]   So let's turn away from physical real estate.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.160]   I want to talk about online real estate.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.200]   I web presence my website, maybe a business I run,
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   because I know you've said that people are quick to have their social media
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.920]   profiles, but maybe they don't have this hub in the middle to tie it all together.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.560]   They can help them build something online. Right.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.120]   Could you talk a bit about why you think that's important?
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.920]   Yeah. So in the old days, 10, 20 years ago,
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.120]   we would just have a resume that we'd submit and it would be tossed
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.640]   into the trash, right?
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.880]   Seven seconds people spend on a resume and that's it.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.480]   Nowadays, everybody Googles who you are, what you do, what you stand for,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.960]   what you believe in.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.400]   And so having your website is vital and thinking about your brand
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.840]   is also vital if you want a job, if you want to do new things.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.400]   I decided to go with financial samurai dot com because I was working in finance
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.000]   when I started the site and I just wanted to have this really cool sounding name.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.640]   I used to live in Japan for two, three years,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.040]   and my girlfriend and now wife is half Japanese and I love it.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.760]   I love the Japanese culture and I thought it was great.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.040]   And I think everybody needs to plant their flag
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   on the Internet and own their domain instead of letting a social media company
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.000]   own you.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.200]   Look, if you write content on Twitter, Facebook, whatever,
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:08.000]   they own you, they have the content and they're getting rich, right?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.680]   You are helping them get rich.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   Instead, why don't you get yourself rich by planting your own flag,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.080]   branding yourself online and sharing with the world what you stand for?
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.280]   It's the green marble theory is my belief that if you have a janky,
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.720]   crusted green marble, if you put it on eBay, someone will want to buy it.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.280]   And the reason why is because there is something like five,
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.320]   six billion people online now.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.000]   And it's the law of attraction. We're all connected.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.800]   You just have to put yourself out there.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.760]   And good things will happen if you stay the course long enough period of time.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.280]   Put another way, do you think everyone should kind of write or produce
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.400]   content somewhere on the line and own the place they do it
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.680]   so they can build an audience or the business around it?
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.360]   It depends on what you want.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.800]   If you want to be hired as a consultant or build your business or whatever,
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.280]   you should probably be a thought leader and thing that you care about the most.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.400]   What I've seen, it's interesting, the VC community, it's fascinating
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.720]   because I think being a VC is one of the best jobs in the world.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.880]   You invest other people's money.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.960]   You don't have to prove yourself for 10 years because that's the life of the fun.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.400]   And you're just collecting big bucks, 2% of fees under management.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.760]   And you get a percentage of the profits if it turns out well.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.040]   And what these folks have done, it's very competitive to attract capital
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.960]   and get your companies to accept your capital, right?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.400]   They've hired thought leaders to write and be on social media
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.720]   and have their websites and write for the VC company's blog
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.840]   every day, every week to showcase their knowledge,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.600]   what they're doing and their brand, because it's so competitive and noisy out
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.200]   that you need to figure out how to make yourself stand out
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.120]   and how to attract the right people that you want for your business.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.720]   As a former VC, I think if you love that job, it's great.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.480]   I found that at the time in my life and maybe things have changed since then.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.760]   But I was like, I really wanted to build products.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.560]   And so as much as it was a great lifestyle, like all the things you said,
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.720]   I was like, I don't want to watch all these people build things.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.440]   I want to build things.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.400]   So I'll just caveat that like it sounds as it's glamorous.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.240]   Yes, you can make a lot of money.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.320]   But at the end of the day, if what you love is actually building the thing
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.200]   and not supporting those doing it, it might not be the most fulfilling career,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.640]   even if you make a lot of money.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.840]   I think that's really admirable that you left the cushy VC job
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.040]   to actually try to build something and then actually successfully sell it.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.120]   I mean, that's amazing to me.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.320]   And what I find amazing is that there are VCs who have no building experience.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.720]   They don't know how to operate a company or start a company.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.760]   And that's kind of amazing to me because as an entrepreneur,
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.200]   you're hopefully leaning on their expertise and experience.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.160]   But it also shows that you can do anything you want.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.600]   The world is your oyster.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.520]   So whether you have any experience or nothing and you just went to business
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.800]   school and learn case studies, you can be a VC too. Awesome.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.560]   It's funny because I think one of the reasons that I left being a VC
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:09.280]   was that I kind of had this feeling of imposter syndrome
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.000]   because I hadn't actually built and grown and scaled a company like you mentioned.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.400]   However, I now look back and realize that
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.240]   those two skill sets are incredibly different.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.520]   And the skill set of a VC is actually much more in line
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.240]   with the skill set of a professional investor than with an entrepreneur
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.320]   or a manager or a CEO.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.800]   And so I think at one point in my career, I thought I couldn't be a VC
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.080]   because I've never built a company.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.920]   Now that I've built a company, I'm like,
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.440]   "I couldn't be a VC because I don't want to be a professional investor."
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.080]   Andy Ratcliffe, who started Wealthfront, who I sold my last company to,
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.000]   told me when someone asked him, "Should I be a VC?"
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.960]   He says, "Well, do you like to invest in stocks on your own?
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.240]   Do you like to pick stocks in your brokerage account?
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.760]   And if you don't, you maybe ask yourself, do you really like investing?"
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.120]   And I always thought that was strange because I'd always thought of VC
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.240]   as like the second career of an entrepreneur.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.880]   And as I looked deeper and deeper at some of the most successful
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.880]   venture capitalists of all time, many of them were not entrepreneurs.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   Many of them are much more adept at picking companies,
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.080]   evaluating businesses than they necessarily were at starting them.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.400]   But boy, did I think that was my flaw.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.280]   That's why I thought I couldn't be a VC in the first place.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.200]   I've evolved that position over time.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.240]   But yeah, before we get back to the episode,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.000]   I just want to thank you for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.000]   You mentioned putting up something online, starting to write.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.080]   Some people in the world will find it.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.400]   And if they do, you know, you can have a business.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.560]   You can also start side hustles.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.080]   One of the things that I've really appreciated on your site
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.040]   that I would love to talk a little bit about is some of the kind of personal
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   and financial and maybe tax benefits of running a business.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.560]   Because something I've learned with this podcast
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.040]   is that when you're employed, you know your salary,
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.440]   and then you usually know what gets deposited in your bank account.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.800]   And at the end of the year, you might owe some taxes or not,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.720]   but it's a pretty straightforward equation.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.960]   But when you run a business, it's actually really confusing
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.240]   because there are a lot of things that might be deductible
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.160]   that maybe weren't when you worked at a company.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.880]   Maybe you don't make that much money,
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.120]   but a lot of the things you spend your money on are less expensive.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.880]   You've written on your site about how vacations can be free
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.160]   if you talk about the vacation, how your car can be depreciated
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.640]   as a business expense.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.080]   You talk a little bit about some of the exciting things,
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.600]   maybe not those two that running a business can afford you.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.960]   I had a decision 10 years ago to run a lifestyle business
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.120]   or try to blow it up and take funding and run a big business
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.920]   and try to make mega millions.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.600]   And at the poker table, I decided with my friends
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.360]   who are all trying to make the mega millions
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.280]   that I would run a lifestyle business
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.240]   because I just got out of banking and I wanted a better lifestyle.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.960]   So, to go back and try to kill myself to run a business,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   to make a lot of money was just totally the antithesis of what I wanted to do.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.560]   And so, the idea is with a lifestyle business or just with a business
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.120]   in general, you want to think about those expenses that are personal expenses
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.720]   that also overlap with your business, right?
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.200]   So, those things include internet costs.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.400]   You need internet to run your business, your iPhone or whatever,
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.520]   your mobile phone to run your business, the monthly subscription on that.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.080]   You have to have a board meeting every single year for your business.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.120]   I think that's the rule.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.240]   You don't have to have it in your mom's basement with free water.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.160]   You can go to Hawaii or wherever you want with your consultants,
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.920]   your editor, whatever it is.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.160]   You can pay for their fare and have your board meeting there.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.000]   It's somewhere more pleasurable.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.440]   And so, the idea is identify those crossover points
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:57.400]   where you need them for your personal life anyway and your business.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:02.040]   And that is where you can probably write off a lot of your expenses.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.800]   But of course, I'm not a CPA, so ask your CPA.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.880]   But the worst thing that can happen is not like you're going to get thrown in jail.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.080]   There's like 70,000 pages on the tax documents in America.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.120]   We make mistakes all the time.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.000]   The worst case is you're going to get a letter and say you actually did this wrong.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.400]   You got to pay this because you didn't pay it.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.280]   And maybe you have to pay like a 5% penalty fee per year, for example.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.000]   So, that's something that people need to understand.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.600]   It's not like the movies where you're just thrown in jail and your life is over.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.200]   People are trying to figure out things on their own.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   And the IRS, they're actually good people because they're trying to clarify
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.320]   and simplify and explain their convoluted tax laws.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.920]   It's crazy. But that's my thoughts in general.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.800]   I wouldn't go and just like expense everything and hope that it'll work.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.600]   But I do think there are a lot of things, if there's a gray area
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.000]   and you're not sure, the worst case isn't as bad as you might think.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.400]   A couple of tactical questions now that I'm over here running a company on my own.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   What was your choice for your business when it comes to retirement plans?
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.240]   How do you do that on a personal level with your business?
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.120]   So, we have the SEP IRA plan, and basically you can contribute.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.800]   I think it's up to 25% of operating profits.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.920]   Operating profits, not revenue, not net profits.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:26.000]   Operating profits to the SEP IRA plan for yourself and your employees.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.560]   So, it's just my wife and me.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.640]   And what I also did for when I had more time before my son was born
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:36.440]   was I did some freelancing, consulting, whatever, ride share stuff,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.840]   just any stuff that I can make money.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.200]   So, I created a solo 401(k) as well.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:46.160]   And so, I was able to contribute to my solo 401(k) and get the SEP IRA plan going.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:51.440]   And what some people don't realize as employees is the maximum 401(k) contribution
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.560]   is not just $20,500 per employee in 2022.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   It's actually way more.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.480]   I forgot the exact number, but it's something like $60,000 plus.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.760]   We can look it up.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.720]   But the employer can contribute even more than the maximum
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.160]   the employee contribute through profit sharing.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.800]   And so, that's something you got to think about before you quit your job
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.600]   or join a startup or whatever.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.880]   What is that 401(k) match?
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.560]   Because it's often not just 3% or $5,000 or whatever.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.040]   It could be tens of thousands of dollars
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.480]   if your employer is really on good financial footing
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.840]   and is really providing a lot of benefits to their employees.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.160]   I think something to just keep in mind
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.600]   is that if you were able to, on a freelance or self-employed basis,
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.560]   make maybe 10% less than your work salary
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.080]   because of some of these benefits, maybe better retirement contributions,
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.640]   maybe more efficient business deductions,
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.960]   you might actually be able to get by on less income than you would.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.880]   Not to mention, if you move to a lower cost of living area,
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   you could definitely get by on less income.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.160]   One area that I want your take on is on health insurance,
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.680]   because that's one expense that you're going to have to pay on your own.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.720]   For people worried about what that means,
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.520]   leaving their job and starting a company
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.200]   and having to cover their own health insurance.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.480]   How have you approached that?
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.840]   So there are a couple of ways to approach it,
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.560]   but what we did was we sucked it up
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.240]   and we decided to pay 100% of our health care insurance.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.160]   We got a platinum plan for the family of three.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.000]   Once my wife left her job in 2015 as well,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.080]   she engineered her layoff as well at $34,500.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.520]   And we paid full freight, which was $1,800,
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.520]   $1,800 to $1,900 a month at the time.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.400]   And now with a family with two kids,
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.480]   we pay about $2,300 a month for a gold plan.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   And so we are not getting any subsidies.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.920]   And I think it's fine.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.680]   We don't need any subsidies.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.840]   But strategically, if you want to get subsidies from the government,
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.400]   you would have to earn less than 400% of the federal poverty limit
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   per household size.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.520]   So, for example, the federal poverty limit for one person
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.000]   is something around $2,700 to $13,000.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.840]   So if you can make as close to that as possible,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.760]   then you will get as much health insurance subsidy as possible.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.800]   So this is why you hear a lot of multimillionaires.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.560]   Let's say, you know, you have two or three million dollars
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.080]   and you have a household of four and your investments,
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.880]   let's say three million generates $60,000, $70,000 in income.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.520]   You can get health care subsidies as a multimillionaire, technically.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.280]   And that's actually what a lot of people do.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.880]   Now, whether that is going with the spirit of the intention of the subsidies
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.040]   is another matter.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.160]   But what we did, we pay full freight, but it's a business expense, right?
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.840]   So if we have a 20% marginal income tax rate, it's $2,300 a month,
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.240]   technically minus 20%.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.760]   And that's our expense.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.880]   I don't think I even knew that that was a business expense.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.480]   So that's an interesting thing.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.400]   Can you talk a little bit about managing finances with a couple,
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.000]   bringing them into the business?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.360]   But I know you have a few unique opinions on managing finances with your partner.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.280]   Yeah, I think if you love your partner,
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.520]   you should strive to make them financially independent of you.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.120]   Right. Because financial dependence, I think, is one of the worst things
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.640]   because we're all adults here.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.560]   Your partner, you had a life before you met each other.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.280]   And I feel that a lot of fights with your partner
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.440]   can be due to money.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.080]   That's top three reason.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.280]   And so having financial independence with your partner
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.640]   and having your own bank accounts, separate accounts,
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.920]   actually is like a release valve for stress that if money becomes an issue,
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.080]   you can just go, I'm going to go spend my own money. It's OK.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.120]   So that's one of my philosophies.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.920]   Make your partner financially independent if you really love them.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.840]   Now, a lot of people are against that.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.960]   They say, oh, we're a one team. Everything is great.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.520]   We're never going to divorce. Yada, yada, yada.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.760]   OK, that's great to do what you want.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.840]   But this is my philosophy in terms of bringing her on the fold.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.520]   Once I helped her engineer her layoff and get a severance in 2015
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.080]   because we had a pact.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.880]   If I was able to negotiate a severance at thirty four and a half and leave,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.600]   she's three years younger than me.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.000]   I said, you too can negotiate a severance when you're thirty four, thirty five
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.960]   and come join me if everything works out great.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.560]   And so everything did work out fine.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.520]   And so I helped her negotiate a severance.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.120]   And we ended up incorporating Financial Samurai
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.680]   and we have our little business.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.480]   And the idea is, look, we are a team.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.320]   I do the front end. I do the writing.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.880]   And she does the editing and she does the filing of the taxes.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.960]   And that's how it goes.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.840]   And we pay ourselves a salary and it's an equal salary.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.480]   And we just treat it as a fun lifestyle business.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   It really is like we can't believe that there's actually income
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.200]   coming in from what we would do for free. It's just fun.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.400]   And if you look at articles on Financial Samurai, it's storytelling.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.720]   It's talking about difficult situations.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.520]   It's not SEO optimized affiliate post after affiliate post
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.280]   like a lot of sites can do.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.600]   And we could do that, too.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.720]   But it's just so soul sucking that we just want to write stories
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.600]   and tell what's going on in our lives.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.200]   That's awesome.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.960]   And one thing that I think is very rare is that in this space,
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.920]   so many people who are in the financial independence route
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.560]   who've quit their job and can work from anywhere end up moving
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.480]   to low cost of living places.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.240]   Yet you're still in where I am, the Bay Area state
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.000]   with the highest income taxes, maybe in the country.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.920]   What do you say to people
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.080]   that think you're crazy for staying here when you could live anywhere?
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.040]   What do I say?
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:34.280]   Well, I grew up overseas for 13 years, six different countries.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.520]   I've been to 60 countries.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.080]   I've lived on the East Coast.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.480]   I've been to the Midwest many, many times for business.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.920]   And I live in San Francisco for 20 years now, more than 21 years.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.880]   And I say I love the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.560]   It's beautiful.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   There's a lot of culture.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.560]   The food is amazing.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.240]   It's perennially ranked top two in the country.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.760]   I can fly to Hawaii if I want to.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.440]   There's tremendous amount of job opportunities, consulting opportunities.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.960]   And I get to look at the ocean every single day out of my house.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.240]   And I feel great.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.440]   And so, yeah, there's a price to pay for that.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.680]   And that is the median home price in San Francisco is 1.8 million.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.120]   And the reason why the median home price is 1.8 million is because you have
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.760]   24 year old engineers who are making 200 to 300 thousand dollars
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.400]   a couple of years out of college.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.800]   Everything is rational.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.400]   The media forgets that the opportunity of each city is what drives the cost,
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.080]   not the other way around.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.960]   And so for much of my life, especially after I left in 2012,
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.240]   I just thought, wow, there's so much opportunity.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.320]   Yes, it's expensive.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   There's consulting here.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.520]   There's a meet up here.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.640]   It's just so fun and it's beautiful.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.160]   Look, I know the media likes to focus on the one street
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.520]   in the worst neighborhood in San Francisco and blow it up.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.880]   I mean, it's really good media.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.440]   You know, they're really smart about that.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.920]   But if you actually come to San Francisco, it's an amazing city.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.960]   And I've been everywhere.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.800]   And so I could have done Hawaii.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.400]   Honolulu is my second favorite city.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.080]   But it's very expensive in Hawaii and adjusted for the income opportunity
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.320]   or the fundings you can do.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.000]   It's a little bit too expensive, actually, in my mind.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.760]   As someone who also lives in the Bay Area, I share a similar sentiment.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.560]   My wife and I both work for a company that we could be remote right now.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.200]   Podcasts I could do from anywhere.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.360]   But I tend to think that money's purpose is, like we said at the beginning, a tool.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.440]   And we love living here.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.040]   The opportunities here are great.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.800]   And for us, yes, we could save more money somewhere else.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.640]   But if money's goal is to allow you to do things you love,
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.760]   then we're using it right now to spend more to stay here.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.000]   I mean, I understand the hatred against San Francisco,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.200]   because if you can't comfortably afford to live in a place, you might hate it.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.600]   Right. It's just logical.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.240]   You got to like shack up with a roommate when you're 40 years old.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.160]   You can't eat what you want or go what you want.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.200]   It's natural. And I understand that.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:58.160]   And what I've also noticed is that we tend to accumulate the amount of wealth.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.360]   That will enable us to afford to live in a place we want to live.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.400]   So if I didn't live in San Francisco and if I lived in, let's say,
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.960]   Austin, I would probably just work as hard as I could to make enough money
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.280]   to cover my expenses in Austin, where the median home price is,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.880]   let's say, $500,000 or $600,000 and be comfortable with that.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.320]   But I like a challenge and it's really fun.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.320]   I have my friends here.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.560]   I have my network here.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.440]   I play tennis.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.360]   And it's just you are what your friends and family are.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.760]   I love it here.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.680]   So I don't see moving anytime soon.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.880]   But speaking of travel and moving and going other places,
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.160]   I know before kids and the pandemic, you did a lot of traveling
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.560]   and a lot of the conversations we have are about travel.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.040]   And I know a lot of our listeners are just now having built up
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.960]   a lot of big balance of points and getting past the pandemic,
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.320]   thinking about where to go.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.640]   I'm curious if you have any suggestions from all the travels
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.680]   you've done of where people might want to take a trip to or check out something
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.760]   that maybe is not the obvious place.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.400]   Hahaha. Oh, man.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   My favorite place is Malaysia,
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.040]   because I also grew up there in my middle school teenage years.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.680]   And that was like exciting.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.640]   The food is the best.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.120]   Top three in the world is very inexpensive.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.400]   I love Angkor Wat, Cambodia.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.080]   It's so hot. It's like 95 degrees and humid.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.040]   But the temples are unbelievable.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.560]   I love Southeast Asia.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.520]   Southeast Asia is a great, great region.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.040]   Friendly people, people speak English.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.400]   The food is amazing.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.040]   And the cost of living is low.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.600]   So, I love that.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.000]   I went to probably 20 different countries in Europe.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:32.800]   I love it as well.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.040]   I love the lifestyle, the attitude of living not for work,
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.320]   but living for living's sake.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.880]   It's just one of those things where after you see like five Gothic churches,
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.000]   they all start looking the same.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.920]   So, I enjoyed Mallorca, Spain.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.800]   Mallorca was amazing.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.760]   The Spanish culture, you eat tapas at 10 p.m.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.720]   You enjoy life, the water, the beaches.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.280]   And then Amsterdam.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.880]   Amsterdam is kind of like the San Francisco of Europe,
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.320]   where people are pretty chill.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.080]   Wheat is available everywhere.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.880]   And there's a really diverse culture.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.560]   And I love Amsterdam as well.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.480]   I haven't been to Mallorca.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.360]   Amsterdam is amazing.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.120]   I want to come back to Malaysia because I think it's a country,
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.920]   having been there, I don't often hear a lot of other people go there
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.880]   that don't have some family there or some business reason to be there.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.920]   So, if someone's thinking right now, listening to this saying, "Oh, Malaysia.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.960]   I've never really thought about going there."
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.280]   What would you tell them to think about as a trip?
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.800]   You don't need to plan a whole week or two itinerary,
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.920]   but what are a few highlights of something they should do?
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.320]   Other than my favorite is just eat all the roti canai you can find on the street.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.680]   That would be like my path.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.160]   But what would you tell someone to think about as they plan a trip?
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.440]   Well, Malaysia, it's a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.840]   And the beauty is food is amazing, right?
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.960]   The mamak stalls, the roti, the milk fish, the chicken, fish, all that stuff.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.360]   The kangkuk belacan, got to check that out.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.200]   You can go to Kuala Lumpur for sure.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.920]   See the palace, see the Batu Caves, go on these excursions.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:05.160]   But go to the Pulau, which are the islands on the east and west,
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.760]   or go to Penang and see the turquoise water and go scuba diving
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:14.040]   70 feet down and still see the water and have nobody around you.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.160]   My favorite trip was to this resort called the Tara's Resort.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.400]   There's an island on the east side and we just had -
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.400]   it was the movie The Beach with Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.240]   It was kind of like that.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:29.400]   You take a dinghy out, you go scuba diving, you come to this cove.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.120]   There'd be some little sharks around, turquoise water.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.880]   And it was just unbelievable.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.960]   So it's the Tara's Resort. I would check that out.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.600]   Awesome. I don't feel like I gave Malaysia its justice on our trip.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.680]   It was part of our eight month backpacking trip around the world.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.120]   And but it was awesome.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.360]   I don't know if this is still the case,
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.120]   but the one thing I remember very specifically because it was a big problem
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.000]   was that the ATMs in Malaysia would not accept
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.560]   any of my two or three American bank cards.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.680]   And so we showed up in Malaysia with probably seven dollars in cash
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.600]   and went to the ATM and it didn't work and we could not get cash.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.240]   So how did you get the cash?
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:14.560]   So I ended up going online and finding some local community
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.640]   in the tech community.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.080]   So there was these events called Bar Camp, which are like
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.240]   conferences that I'd gotten to know, and I just went like Kuala Lumpur Bar Camp,
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.120]   emailed the list serve and was like, can anyone here meet me in Kuala Lumpur?
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.640]   And I can pay you money and you can bring me cash.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.680]   But my new plan is never go to a country without at least like
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   maybe one hundred dollars of cash.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.040]   We literally probably had like seven dollars,
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.680]   which can get you a lot farther in Malaysia than I imagine.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.800]   But not too far, but not too far.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.680]   Wow. OK. Yeah. Bring cash.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.640]   And again, the terrace beach and spa was on Redang Island, Redang Island.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.240]   OK, cool. Awesome.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.600]   So I also want to talk a little about parenting.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.760]   We've kind of hit on it a little bit here and there, but we haven't gone deep.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.280]   I know not everyone in this conversation listening has children,
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.600]   but you've written so much about it.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.680]   I'm at home with a two year old and a two month old, and it's been top of mind
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.960]   for the last two and a half years.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.520]   And there are a bunch of decisions that have to be made
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.000]   that you highlight in the book.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.760]   I'd love to just run through a few things, get your perspective
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.480]   and see where it goes.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.160]   You mentioned the rising cost of education.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.040]   I'm curious how you've thought about approaching five twenty nine savings
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.160]   for college, how much to put in there and all of that.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.320]   So I think the rising cost of tuition
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.200]   that is rising faster than the rate of inflation is kind of a racket.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.400]   And it's kind of a racket because colleges don't guarantee
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.440]   any graduate a job, right?
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.400]   If they guaranteed a minimum paying job, then it wouldn't be a racket.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.440]   But I think, you know, charging seven, 8%, 10% every single year forever.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.520]   While everything online is for free, you can learn everything, right?
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.240]   YouTube, blog posts, even like the college lectures they put online.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.000]   So why are we spending so much money on tuition?
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.080]   And why are colleges, these great colleges still only accepting
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.720]   a same level number of people if they really want to educate and help humanity?
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.440]   Right. They have a different motive.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.320]   They want to keep their status, keep their eliteness, all that stuff
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.760]   and keep people out.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.800]   That's my cynical view.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.600]   But I think that's the realistic view as to why things have not changed
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.600]   in terms of tuition and acceptance rates in terms of five to nine plan.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.800]   Unfortunately, we have to think about our children and play this game
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.440]   because education is the most important thing we can provide our children.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.560]   If you're educated, you can have the courage to take risks,
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.920]   do things to make you money and live a better life.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.120]   So for five to nine plan, I think it's a no brainer to contribute to it.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.840]   We have super funded our children's five to nine plans
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.960]   the year they were born.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.280]   And so we can't fund it for another five years.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.640]   And if we overfund it, it's fine because you can just write
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.280]   a different person's name as the beneficiary, right?
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.920]   If your child ends up being a genius, gets a grant, scholarship and all that,
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.080]   and you got 100,000 leftover, just change the name, change it back to yourself.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.760]   Change it to your nephew, niece, aunt wants to do graduate school, whatever.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.960]   Five to nine plan is one of the best ways to transfer wealth in a responsible way
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.720]   instead of just giving money to transfer well for the use of education.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   I'll actually say there's a great hack, which is if you get a scholarship,
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.960]   you're actually allowed to fee free, take the money out
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.240]   that was given as a scholarship.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.720]   So there you go.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   If you don't have anyone, other siblings, other people
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.440]   you want to give the money to, you can actually take it out in that circumstance.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.640]   I know this is a topic in the book that I was excited to read.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.400]   Public versus private school and spending money for education
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.320]   when there is public education as well.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.680]   How would you help someone approach that thought about deciding
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.760]   whether they send their kids to public or private school?
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:56.160]   So I went to public school, high school, college, graduate school, all public school.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.000]   I went to international private schools
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.240]   when I was in the Foreign Service in Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines and Zambia.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.160]   So I have a ratio.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.120]   It's that you can go to a private school if it fits your kids needs.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.720]   If your gross income is equal to at least seven times the net tuition of one child.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   So in other words, if the net tuition costs $20,000,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.440]   you got to make at least $140,000 to be okay
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.520]   sending your child to private school.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.560]   Because remember, your goal is also put your oxygen mask on first
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.280]   and save and invest for your retirement as well.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.440]   And it used to be the multiple is more like five times,
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.480]   but I've upped it to six to seven and might continue to go up
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.080]   because I feel that education is more and more free and accessible to everyone.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.760]   Therefore, the idea of spending more and more money on private school
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.520]   just doesn't make sense because after, let's say you send your kid
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.640]   from private school, from kindergarten through four years of college,
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.360]   it's about $780,000
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.640]   without any returns here in San Francisco, just for normal private schools.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.600]   And college, if you slap on a 4% rate of return,
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   which is pretty reasonable and pretty achievable,
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.480]   it's like $1.1 million that you're going to spend.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.120]   So think about it from your child's perspective, who doesn't know better,
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.200]   but who will know better based on your tutelage.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.280]   Would they rather go to public school
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.320]   and have a check for $1.1 million when they graduate from college
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.120]   or, you know, farmed out over, you know, a five-year period
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.120]   so they don't spend all their money and go crazy?
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   Or would they rather go to private school?
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.440]   Ask your children that, give them that dilemma,
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.360]   and then also ask yourself what you can do in terms of accelerating your retirement
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.040]   if you had $1 million more as well.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.880]   So those are my thoughts.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.360]   I think it's not the end all be all, whether you go to private school, public school.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.720]   I think what's most important is that you develop your social skills,
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.520]   communication skills and actual practical knowledge
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.360]   so that you can get a good job or start your own business.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.520]   I love how in the book, you take questions like this
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.680]   and you help approach the average person on how to think about them from both sides.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.600]   So I definitely think anyone listening should check it out.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.920]   It's linked in the show notes, so you can find it there or really wherever books are sold.
