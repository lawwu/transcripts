[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   I'm back to dork mode. Another call.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.920]   All right. That was a great bit there. Our next call is about
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.840]   basically talking about those Conor arguments, but in this
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.400]   case, it's authors that run counter to your career capital
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.800]   theory.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.280]   Yeah, people are really out to get me today.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.240]   Hey, Cal, my name is Donald and I'm thinking about transitioning
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.760]   my career as we move cities, my fiance and I. And so my question
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.880]   today is actually about how to have two conflicting ideas about
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   something. How do we hold those? I know you talk a lot about the
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.120]   making sure we're reading different authors and different
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.600]   perspectives on a theory, or whatever that might be to make
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.720]   sure that you're getting both sides and letting those sit with
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.280]   with you and kind of battle it out, so to speak. And I read so
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200]   good, they can't ignore you pretty early on in my career. And
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.880]   I am a big believer in it. And I'm 10 or 12 years into my
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.720]   career now. And I've gained this capital, but I have this other
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.200]   passion that's kind of nagging at me. And from the career
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800]   capital side, I know I shouldn't necessarily follow that passion
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.360]   right now. But I'm curious if you know of any authors, books
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.000]   or other people on this topic that might run counter to your
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.480]   career capital theory. I firmly believe in it. But I'm also
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.760]   trying to practice what we preach around here about making
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.080]   sure to have different opinions to, to allow to help me kind of
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.520]   make this decision. Would love any thoughts you have. And
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.840]   again, just really appreciate what you do. Thanks, Cal.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.280]   All right, well, now I'm wishing he had told us what the passion
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.080]   was. Because that could be actually be pretty relevant for
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.600]   thinking about this. But I like your approach here, because what
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.160]   I preach, which is having differing, smart opinions about
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.720]   things in your head at the same time gives you a more nuanced
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   understanding of the world. And we were just joking in the last
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.320]   caller, but we were talking about Alan Jacobs essay, and he
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.000]   had a different take on productivity than mine, and
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   we're kind of joking about it. But actually, that collision. So
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.760]   my sort of dorkish New York article, versus like, Alan
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.120]   Jacobs, Hedgehog Review article, crash those together. And what
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.400]   you come away with is not a one exploded. And this one is right,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.600]   you have a more nuanced understanding of the topic,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.400]   which I think is excellent. So if we're thinking about career
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.920]   capital theory, what are good things to push up against that?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.800]   Well, again, let's clarify exactly what career capital
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   theory is saying. What it's saying is that typically, the
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.760]   things that make a good job good are rare and valuable. So you
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   have to have something rare and valuable to offer in return. And
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560]   in the professional context, it'll be rare and valuable
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.880]   skills. So get better at things that are valuable, then use
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.120]   those things as leverage to shape your career in ways that
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440]   resonate. That's a pretty repeatable path towards feeling
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.680]   really good about your career. There's other takes on this,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.640]   obviously, like the straw man take, which is popular in
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.360]   culture, but is rarely I think, articulated in good books. So
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.800]   simplicitly, the straw man alternative is just no, no,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.080]   follow your passion, you're inborn to do one thing. If you
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.880]   do that thing, you'll love it. If you don't, you won't. But
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.760]   that's a bit of a straw man, because I would say that the
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   more important counterpoints to career capital theory would be a
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.440]   little bit more subtle. So one of the counterpoints you should
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.800]   try to encounter, and I think Wendell Berry, who we talked
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.120]   about at the beginning of the show is a good example of this,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.840]   is, and the Jacobs essay we just read, is the whole strain of
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.920]   thought that says, shaping your career shouldn't be the most
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.000]   important thing anyways. What matters is building a good life
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.320]   based on values that is important, and you might need
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   some money in there. So you have a job, but stop thinking so
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.560]   much about your job anyways, except for to the degree to
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.800]   that, which it steps on other things that are important to
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.360]   you. This is like Barry leaving his teaching job in New York to
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.120]   go, you know, live in Kentucky. But there's any numbers of
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.760]   examples of books where you see people building a life of
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.280]   meaning off of focusing on values that maybe have very
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.080]   little to do with their work. So I mean, I can give you some
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.400]   specific suggestions here. Go back and read a classic, like
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.640]   Thomas Merton, with the Seven Story Mountain, I believe it's
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.560]   called, which is about him. It's a memoir. I'm actually reading
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.800]   it right now, it's one of my March books. But a memoir about
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.760]   how he also, like Barry, left life in New York as a writer,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.320]   and eventually becoming a monk, and writing about the
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.320]   experience. And it was very inspirational to a lot of
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.440]   people. But he just downgraded the professional aspect of his
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.880]   life. Richard Rohr's book, R-O-H-R, I want to get this
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.720]   right, falling...can you look this up, Jesse? Richard Rohr,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.720]   Falling Up? Falling...it's falling something, Jesse's
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.360]   going to look this up. But it's a book...
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.960]   Falling Upward.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.040]   Falling Upward. That's a book I read, Richard Rohr, R-O-H-R.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.720]   He's also a Catholic, in a Catholic order. I think he
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.760]   might be a Franciscan. It's about how in the second half of
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.920]   life, building your life around service to others is the source
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.240]   of the deepest meaning. David Brooks read Richard Rohr, and
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.800]   then wrote basically his own version of Falling Upward. It's
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.080]   called The Second Mountain, which is again, I would read The
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.360]   Second Mountain, I would throw that right against So Good They
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.760]   Can't Ignore You. They'll hit together, and sparks will fly
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.800]   and something even better will emerge. So The Second Mountain
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.080]   is about how maybe the first half of your adult life is aimed
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.600]   towards what he calls resume values, building up your career,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.800]   making it the way you like. But then the second half of your
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.240]   adult life is where you really focus on eulogy values. And it's
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.560]   again, service to others, connection to other people. You
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.960]   see David Brooks struggling with building meaning beyond just his
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.360]   otherwise very successful career. So you read those type
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.320]   of books, and you get this counterpoint that says, "Yeah,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.560]   whatever." Right? Like your work is what it is, but it's not
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.360]   going to be at the core of a life well lived. So I think
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.440]   that's what you might want to read. Because my concern here,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.560]   and again, I don't know what the passion is you're talking about,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.800]   but if it's a professional passion, my concern here is that
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.360]   it's possible that you're heading towards this second
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   mountain in life, this Richard Rohr falling upwards. And you're
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.960]   feeling that dissatisfaction, that hunger, a soul ache, so
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.640]   it's something quite deep. And you're saying, you're looking
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.200]   just within the professional lane. So maybe I need to change
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.120]   my job. And if my job was something that was more
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.280]   passionate about, I would get that back. That's possible. I
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.000]   think it changes everything else in your life.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.400]   So I think those books are going to find useful. I think also
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.120]   just my deep life philosophy in general, it's not contrary to
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.640]   So Good They Can't Ignore You, but it generalizes it and
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.240]   contains it. Because my deep life philosophy, which again,
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.360]   there's a recorded a core idea video on this. So go to
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.040]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia, go to the core ideas playlist, go
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   to the deep life, the deep life core idea video, is it
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.120]   constrains that professional part to just one of four or five
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.560]   different areas that we call buckets that you focus on. And
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.880]   when you see the four or five different buckets of your life,
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.840]   you're then caring about how they interact and connect with
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.080]   each other, you're not just prioritizing one over the other.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.440]   So you might find those exercises useful too. And again,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.920]   they don't repudiate So Good They Can't Ignore You, but they
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.240]   constrain it and put into a larger context. That's a good
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   question. And that is what I'd recommend. I think you're going
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.000]   to get some good feedback there, get some good pushback.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.600]   And I'm glad you're seeking that. All right, do we have a
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.400]   caller now, Jesse, where they're like, I just wanted to tell you,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.880]   you're brilliant. And your work is 100% right. And they like
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.400]   your part. And I like the part in your hair and you don't look
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.840]   dorky. And I think you're cool. Like Che Guevara, we just get
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.280]   one caller that says that. Jesse is shaking his head no.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.740]   *Chuckle*
