[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   One final time we're joined by Matt Chandler, the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.360]   Matt is the author of the new book, The Mingling of Souls, God's Design for Love, Marriage,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360]   Sex and Redemption.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.600]   I have a list of 10 questions on relationships queued up for Matt, and we've worked through
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.080]   all 10 of them.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.640]   So Matt, we have time for one more question we receive all the time on the podcast.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.740]   I'll throw it in as question number 11.
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.800]   Many Christian singles who do not find a spouse end up dating non-Christians and compromising
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.320]   themselves.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.960]   What does Christ have to offer to a Christian who is tired of the weirdnesses of Christian
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.000]   dating, who longs to be married, who is sick of being lonely, who doesn't have any Christian
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.960]   prospects at the moment, and who isn't getting any younger?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.760]   What would you say to this listener?
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   Oh gosh.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.200]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.580]   I want to just, I want to totally affirm the desire to be married.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.460]   I just don't, I don't want anybody to ever feel guilty about that desire, because I feel
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.900]   like so often, particularly single women, God bless them, I just feel like they can
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.940]   get, you know, find your contentment in Christ.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.780]   Why, I mean, why is Christ not enough?
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.740]   And I just think that's such a terrible, terrible response, because the desire to get married
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.740]   is a good desire.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.860]   It may be one that's been woven into them by the creator of the universe.
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.820]   If the Bible says, "He who finds a wife finds what is good," that's all I need for both
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.980]   the man and the woman to go, "This is a good thing to be desired."
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.820]   If to find it is good, then let's desire it.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.020]   But like all desires, they have to be placed where they belong.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.460]   And so I want to affirm this desire to be married.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:52.820]   I want to warn against loneliness and this desire being a desire that's so far up in
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.660]   your list of desires that you would be willing to compromise and put yourself in a situation
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.420]   that would be far more horrific and far more lonely than you currently are.
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.620]   And so one of the things that I have unfortunately been able to watch on repeat the last 20 years
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.900]   of Christian ministry is godly women get to that place where the "weirdness" of Christian
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:25.060]   dating and the apathy of Christian men to actually pursue them has led them to marryâ€”I
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.380]   won't even go as far as say just lost guys, but what I'll just call "neat Christian voice."
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.460]   So maybe they go to church a couple of times a month, or maybe they just have a Bible that
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.180]   they own, and oh yeah, they're Christian.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.340]   So they justify getting into a relationship with a man who will not lead them, who doesn't
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.460]   really love the Lord, but does come to church.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.660]   And this ends almost every time in heartbreak, where now they're in a covenant, they feel
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.860]   trapped in that covenant relationship, and so they try to fix their husbands.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.780]   That's not working, so then they hope maybe having children will fix their husbands, and
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.980]   that's what will engage their husband's heart back towards the Lord and back towards them.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.900]   And then they have children, and now the father is discipling their children, not towards
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.220]   the Lord, but from the Lord.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.540]   And so in all of this, the way I've tried to counsel our single women here at the Village
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.260]   Church is, "Men, give yourself over to ministry and to serving the Lord."
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.540]   And I mean give yourself over.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:37.120]   So there's a woman who lives with us, she's in her mid-30s, and she leads a ministry where
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.820]   she's running these discipleship groups of women all over the country.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.580]   It's like in 11 or 12 states, and there's like 50 or 60 leaders that she's pouring herself
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580]   into.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.420]   She walked these dGroups through Grudem Systematic Theology, then she's walking them, I think,
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.420]   this semester through the Book of Genesis, and it's a very serious, robust study of God's
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.420]   Word.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.920]   And she desires to be married, she would love to be married, but she's not waiting to be
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.260]   married for her life to matter, for her life to count.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.900]   So she has moved in with us, she's very much a part of our family, and she's given herself
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.760]   over to Christian ministry.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.920]   And even when I think of the young woman who helped shape some of these questions, she's
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   given herself over to serve the Lord, to write and to teach and to disciple and to open up
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.780]   her home to care for other women and to encourage other women to grow in biblical literacy.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.400]   And I think that that's what Christ has for them, fulfilling, soul-stirring, soul-satisfying
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.920]   gospel ministry.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920]   Amen.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   Thank you, Matt, for your example and for joining us in this podcast.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.320]   We really appreciate it.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.480]   It's my pleasure, brother.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   That was Matt Chandler, the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas and the author
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.960]   of the new book, The Mingling of Souls, God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.920]   He joined us in episodes number 522 to 529 to answer some of the most pressing questions
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.800]   singles face in the church.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.400]   And we are very grateful for his time and for his pastoral wisdom.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.120]   Well, we are back with John Piper tomorrow.
