[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.480]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.000]   hacks.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.200]   And today we're talking jobs, careers, and everything in between with Katherine
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.640]   Minshew, founder and CEO of The Muse, a career platform that serves over 7
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.040]   million people each month, and the co-author of the best-selling book, The
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.200]   New Rules of Work, the modern playbook for navigating your career.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.480]   I am so excited to chat with her about finding and getting the right job, making
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.920]   networking suck a whole lot less, and how to build your personal brand online
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   without needing to become a social media influencer.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.560]   But before we jump in, I want to share two quick things.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.280]   First, I would love your support in nominating All The Hacks for a Plutus
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   Award for the best new personal finance podcast.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.280]   It will only take a couple seconds, and you can do it by going to
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.720]   allthehacks.com/vote.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.880]   Second, I'm going to be doing a listener mailbag episode soon.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.000]   So if you have any questions for me, or you have any hacks to share with the
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.640]   thousands of All The Hacks listeners, please send an email to
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.880]   chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.840]   All right, let's get to the interview.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.120]   Katherine, thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.520]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.840]   I'm really excited to join.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.320]   We actually have had a bunch of people write in asking if we could do an
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   episode on career, work, jobs, everything.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   So I'm really excited to do this.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.680]   And I want to kick it off with just a random question, which is, what do you
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.800]   think is the biggest misconception when it comes to navigating the modern
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.520]   workplace?
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.960]   Oh, the biggest misconception.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.800]   I think a lot of people are so fixated on how do I get the job?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.480]   How do I convince the company to choose me that they forget to ask themselves
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.640]   what do I want?
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.200]   And what type of company should I be picking?
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   Because a job is not one size fits all, right?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.800]   It is incredibly dependent, not only on your skills, strengths, experiences, but
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.720]   also your preferences, your needs, your values, and how those align with the
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.640]   kind of preferences, needs, values of the team that you work with, the
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.000]   organization that you work for.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.360]   And I think sometimes, especially early career professionals, but I see this at
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.640]   any age, people are so focused on getting picked, getting chosen, getting through
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.280]   the interview, that they forget to really turn the question around.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.480]   And how do you think people should figure that out?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.400]   Like, if you are not happy in your current job, and you're not sure what you
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.600]   want to do next, obviously, you could just start applying to random jobs.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.680]   But is there a process or some advice you give people that are unsure what they
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.200]   should do?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.240]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.560]   And in fact, I don't recommend starting with applying to random jobs, because I
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   think that there's a step before that, a phase zero, that sets you off on the
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.280]   right foot.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   And that is a process of self-discovery and self-exploration.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.440]   Now, before, you know, someone listening freaks out, it doesn't have to be weeks
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.960]   or months long, you could do it in a focused afternoon, although I do
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.520]   recommend taking a week or two if you have the time.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.720]   And essentially, it's a process of looking at where you are, the experiences
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.840]   that you've had in the past, and trying to ascertain when have you been in flow
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680]   state, which is, you know, as probably everyone listening knows, when just time
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.000]   seems to fly by and you're totally locked in, you can start to think about when
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.160]   have you been happiest in your career?
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   When have you felt most motivated, and most engaged and productive at work?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   If you have the time, I really recommend asking friends, family, perhaps former
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.280]   colleagues who you don't worry might be might be tipped off to the fact that
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.240]   you're thinking about a change, but asking them, you know, what do you see as
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.960]   my strengths?
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.200]   When do you see me light up professionally?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.920]   And I think once you start to zero in on a couple of your values,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.280]   professionally, it can be much easier and more straightforward to organize a job
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.600]   search.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.240]   And these aren't these values aren't the same for everyone, right?
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   So you might realize that you really value a stable work environment, or
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.640]   someone might want quite the opposite.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.440]   They might want a work environment where things are constantly changing, and
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.760]   there's experimentation and things are very new and fresh.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.200]   Some people might really value prestige or compensation.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.080]   Other people might want maximum flexibility, or creativity, or they may
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.240]   want to be deeply aligned with the mission of the organization that they
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   work for.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.440]   There are a lot of different things you can prioritize in your career, but
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.080]   you're not necessarily going to find a job or a company that is 10 out of 10 on
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   every dimension in the world.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.480]   But you can find one that's 10 out of 10 on the you know, three to four values or
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.880]   dimensions that matter most to you.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.200]   So I think that's the most powerful place to start.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.840]   Even though sometimes people can get impatient, and they just want to dive in
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.600]   and jump in.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.800]   Yeah, I've been in this situation before.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.320]   And if you get laid off, obviously, there's a different sense of urgency to
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.960]   what happens.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   But I noticed you didn't say, you know, pursue your passion, which is something I
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.320]   hear a lot of people often say when you're looking for what to do.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.680]   How do you feel about that phrase?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.200]   I just don't find it very helpful as a phrase, right?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   First of all, like, what is my passion?
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.440]   A lot of people don't know, and labeling something a passion can make the stakes
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.120]   feel incredibly high.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.920]   Secondly, a lot of people are actually happier serving their passion if it is
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.520]   outside of work, but they pick a professional set of pursuits that
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.200]   complement it.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.000]   You might love to paint, but do you want to be a professional painter?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.720]   Maybe and if you do, absolutely, like go live your dreams.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.000]   But for a lot of people that have a passion for painting or a passion for some
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.720]   sort of perhaps artistic endeavor, they are actually happier not putting all of
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.360]   the pressures of financially supporting themselves on that passion.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.520]   They're happier thinking about a career that is motivating, that is exciting, but
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.120]   perhaps provides the financial stability or the flexibility.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.320]   Again, I think live your passion is, you know, it's a fun phrase.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.800]   It's a great catchphrase, but I just think it's a little bit overused because, you
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.040]   know, it doesn't necessarily provide signpost.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.480]   Now, for some people, they're deeply passionate about making some sort of
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.520]   change in the world or a specific mission.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.640]   And if you can align your career with the larger good you want to see in the
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.120]   world, that's incredibly motivating.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.000]   And I think it's something that, again, if that matters to you deeply, you should
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.440]   absolutely strive to do.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.400]   But I wouldn't necessarily say that always fits in the catchphrase of like follow
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.040]   your passion.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.480]   I think that sometimes it's helpful to just take a step back and and really think,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.960]   you know, what what am I good at?
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.600]   What can I make a living at?
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.680]   What do I enjoy?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.280]   Where's an intersection between those?
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.720]   And again, if you have a passion, an artistic pursuit, a hobby, et cetera, I
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.320]   think it's really important and fair to say, do I want this to be my livelihood or
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.800]   do I want this to be a beautiful and important part of a larger life that
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000]   includes a different professional component?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.080]   And I think that both of those are really valid.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.680]   And again, I just really encourage people to ask themselves the question and honor
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.160]   whatever answer comes up for them, not what answer you think culturally you
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.600]   should choose or what your friends say or what some influencer on Instagram told
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   you to do.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.360]   It's really like what is the right answer for you specifically, because each of us
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.440]   has such a different set of needs as well as hopes and dreams in our careers.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.200]   Yeah, my brother in law loves golf and used to be a professional golfer briefly
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.480]   and realized that that changes the whole thing.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.040]   When this thing that you loved doing as a hobby, as a way to spend time, as a way
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.400]   to enjoy time with friends becomes your job.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.320]   He started not loving golf as much as he had before and immediately was like, I
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.280]   need to find something else.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.720]   And now he runs North American sales at AppDynamics and it's a totally different
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.160]   career and is so happy that he's not a professional golfer but still golfs all
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.640]   the time.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.680]   So I'm a big fan.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.240]   You know, my day job is not pursuing, you know, all the all the hacks.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.120]   It just happens to be what I do on my free time.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   So it doesn't have to be the same thing.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.280]   I totally agree.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.760]   If we go back in time for you, how does what you're doing now line up with your
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.160]   passion?
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.640]   How did you end up finding an entire career in, you know, this career?
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:12.360]   Yeah, so I do feel like I pursued my own winding, eclectic career path by
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.920]   following a lot of the principles that are now part of what I talk about via the
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.240]   Muse and via my book.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.400]   So for me, when I started, and actually I'll go back like way back to age 13, 14
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.240]   year old Catherine, I fell in love with that television show Alias that starred
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.000]   Jennifer Garner.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.760]   If you or anybody listening remembers, it was this amazing show about like a double
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.200]   agent.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.040]   And I decided really early on, I was going to be either a CIA agent or an
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.640]   ambassador.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.080]   Like that was the plan.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.240]   That was the goal.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.400]   I did actually briefly think also about pursuing theater professionally.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.760]   Theater was a big extracurricular passion of mine, and I loved it.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.440]   But you know, when I did a few community theater productions or talk to people who
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.840]   were professionals in the field, to your point about your brother, it didn't really
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.640]   feel like doing that professionally was going to be as fulfilling as doing it as a
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.360]   hobby or, you know, an activity that I deeply enjoyed.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   And so I focused in on like, I'm going to be this secret agent or this, you know,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.640]   state department official.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:22.840]   And luckily in 2007, I applied for and was accepted to work at a US embassy in
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.760]   Nicosia, Cyprus in the regional security office.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.680]   And let me tell you, I have some amazing stories from that time.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:37.120]   It was a totally wild, fascinating experience, but I very quickly realized
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.200]   that the sort of reality of life in the state department and in government service
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.040]   in general, it didn't match this idea I had built up in my head, right, about what
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.400]   the career was actually like.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.600]   And so even though I consider that time to be an incredible experience, I also came
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.120]   out of it with all of the angst of a 22-year-old saying like, "What do I want to
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.040]   do with my life if it's not this?"
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.200]   And I then spent the next two or three years feeling somewhat lost.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.040]   I worked at McKinsey and Company as a consultant for a few years.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.880]   I moved to Kigali, Rwanda and ran a vaccine introduction for a period of time, which,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.360]   by the way, fascinating now that vaccines are in the news again.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.200]   But I was really trying these different careers and I was also spending a lot of
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.640]   time on job boards.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.320]   I was on monster.com all the time.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.680]   I was looking on different company career websites, trying to figure out what were
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.120]   the jobs that were even out there?
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.800]   What did that actually mean to do those jobs?
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.720]   Would I like that?
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.640]   And I became just personally fascinated by, first of all, how complex the career
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.280]   search is.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.360]   I became really interested in how to assess what a company's culture and values are
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.160]   from the outside.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.800]   What is the employee experience like?
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.320]   Because it's very different at very different companies.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   You know, a sales job or an engineering job or a marketing job is not a single
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.760]   interchangeable thing where it doesn't matter where you work.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   No, it actually matters very much where you work.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.040]   And so I was really interested in how people make career decisions from the
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.080]   outside. And it frustrated me at the same time when I was leaving McKinsey.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.640]   I was getting recruited by some hedge funds, by big tech companies, and some of
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.360]   them were rolling out the red carpet with these very expensive recruiting dinners.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.560]   And all of this time, they were investing one-on-one in me, trying to convince me
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.520]   to join their company.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.280]   And then I would go online and look at other jobs.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.800]   And it was this terrible, transactional, paper-thin experience where they were
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.120]   just like, "Do you have these skills?
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.080]   Apply. Maybe we'll consider you."
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.560]   Like, it was just terrible.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.560]   And I thought there's got to be something between these two extremes.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.800]   There should be an online platform that helps create a digital red carpet
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.680]   experience, that gives someone insight into the culture and values that
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.800]   a company, you know, and helps also guide and coach people as they go through
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.920]   the often fraught and challenging process of finding a job, figuring out what
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.600]   they want to do.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.960]   And so the idea for The Muse was percolating for a long time before I
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.880]   actually started the business.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.080]   But I really felt like I built it because I needed it and it didn't exist.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.560]   Well, that's amazing.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.360]   I had like six follow-ups that came from that.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.200]   Okay, go.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.040]   One was, you ended up having to go work at the State Department in order to
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.120]   figure out that you didn't want to do that.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.920]   Knowing everything you know now, do you think there's something you could have
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.440]   done to figure out if that would have been a good fit without having to go do it?
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.840]   You know, I think if I had been able to sit down with people who worked at the
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.040]   State Department, what's called an informational interview, that might have
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.280]   given me the insight that I needed, or even watching enough videos of people
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.680]   who were in that career path talking about a typical day in their life, what
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.160]   they did, how it worked.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.840]   That's frankly, some of the experience that I've tried to approximate with The
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   Muse, because not everyone has the opportunity to go work for an
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.400]   organization and then change their mind or go sit down one-on-one over coffee
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.440]   with someone who's in a particular career field.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   Obviously, I got a really deep front-row seat to what the organization was like by
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.480]   working there, but I absolutely think that had I been a little bit savvier of a job
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.800]   searcher, I might have been able to recognize that beforehand without going
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   all the way to Cyprus to find out that it wasn't the end-all be-all for the rest of
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.440]   my career.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.480]   So that brings up an important part of this entire process that you dedicate, I
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.840]   think, an entire chapter to about networking with people.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.200]   I'd love to just dig into how you think people could do a better job.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.440]   I know that it can be daunting for some people, especially going into a new career
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.840]   to find people, both for the purpose of learning, for the purpose of having an in
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.240]   if you find a company you want.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.880]   Are there things you think people should start with to try to build those skills
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.560]   and be productive with networking?
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   Yeah, so first of all, I don't know about you, but when I first started thinking
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.560]   about networking, it almost had a bad rap to me, right?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.760]   I imagine these guys in ill-fitting suits and briefcases, mechanically shaking hands
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.680]   and passing business cards back and forth in like a hotel lobby.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.480]   And I think if you break that apart in your mind and you just say, OK, networking is
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.720]   about meeting new people, learning about them, getting to know them, and thinking
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.200]   about it as a long game of just investing in those around you.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.360]   It really reframes networking for a lot of people.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.000]   And I think that it also helps you understand what works for you.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.520]   Some people really ace those big, giant networking events like conferences.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.600]   Other people do really well by hosting their own smaller networking events, getting
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.080]   to know people in quieter or more small group settings.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.040]   And I think that's all right.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:08.120]   So when I think about tips for networking, I often encourage people to understand your
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.040]   own preferences, what's going to make you most comfortable.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.120]   Do you want to try going to bigger events?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.600]   Do you want to invite four people that you know professionally and ask them to each
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.880]   invite two people and host some sort of smaller group?
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.280]   I've had people have great success organizing book clubs around professional
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.800]   related books and using that as a forum to meet people.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.920]   So understand what works for you.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.680]   I think it's also helpful to set a few goals for yourself.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.400]   Is it that you want to attend one networking event a month or reach out to three
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.320]   contacts from your network every week to see how they're doing?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.840]   Whatever the goals are, sometimes just writing them down can give you a clarity
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.240]   around what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.600]   If you're going to in-person events, I always recommend, you know, dress
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.240]   comfortably.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.800]   You want to focus on the people there, not your shoes or your outfit.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.480]   It can be really great to bring what I term in the book, a wingman or a wingwoman,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.640]   which is someone else who's in your same professional space who you feel very
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.200]   comfortable with.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.480]   You enjoy their company so that, you know, you may find that at the event you spend
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.520]   a lot of time apart talking to different people, but you also know that if you want
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.960]   a kind of touchstone or you want to just recenter yourself in the middle of the
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.440]   event, you can go find them, join the conversation they're having and vice
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:18.840]   versa.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.400]   I also think that again, networking doesn't have to be this sort of large kind of
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   faceless thing.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.400]   You can focus at times on just, you know, a smaller number of deeper connections
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.120]   and informational interviews are a really helpful way to do that.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.080]   And, you know, is it helpful if I talk a little bit about informational interviews
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.440]   for people who may not be as, as familiar with the best practice there?
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.880]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.040]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.600]   emerge.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.120]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.680]   processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:01.320]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one 37,000.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.840]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.240]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.000]   not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.600]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.560]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.760]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.160]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.640]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.840]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.160]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.400]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.280]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.440]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.760]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.560]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.440]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart digestion
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.240]   and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.880]   So what is an informational interview?
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.200]   First of all, it's sitting down, usually one to one across the table or on a Zoom
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.240]   with someone who's in a career field or a role that you're interested in and
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.080]   learning more.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.880]   What do they do in a typical day?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.840]   What are the kind of best and worst things about their job?
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:13.520]   It's a really great way of exploring a career field, a company, a particular type
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.840]   of work before you dive in and fully commit.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.960]   Frankly, it's what I wish I had done earlier in my career so that I would have
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.040]   known more about some of these different fields before I dove in.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.480]   So there's a few tips that I find make informational interviews go much better.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.600]   First of all, do your research ahead of time.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.720]   Many informational interviews will start out with either you reaching out cold to
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.280]   someone, perhaps through your network, through your college or university's
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.360]   alumni network.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.680]   You know, you might be introduced by a mutual friend, but you're reaching out to
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.080]   someone and asking for 15, 30 minutes, maybe an hour of their time to learn more
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.120]   about their career path and guide you on your own.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   And so I think it's really helpful to do a bit of research ahead of time,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.720]   understand where they've come from, what are some of the key elements of or key
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.120]   turning points in their career so that you're not asking them questions that you
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.800]   could have answered with a Google search, thinking about making a good impression.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.200]   This is someone who might be able to refer you for a job or an opportunity in the
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.880]   future, someone that you may be able to help.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.720]   So really being prompt, being respectful of their time is very helpful.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.640]   I also love asking what I call dual questions or positive negative questions.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   So sometimes one of the most helpful things you can learn from an informational
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.880]   interview is something like what sort of people would not be happy in a career
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.240]   field like yours, or what are some of the challenges of working at, you know,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.360]   company XYZ.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.160]   But often if you ask a directly negative shaded question like that, sometimes
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.240]   people will be protective of where they work.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.880]   And so they may hesitate to give you an honest answer, which is why I like these
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.640]   dual questions.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   It's essentially asking a positive and a negative at the same time.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.880]   So this might look like asking someone, I'd really love to understand more what
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.680]   it's actually like to work at company XYZ.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.200]   What are some of your favorite things about working there?
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.240]   And what are some of the things that might be more challenging or frustrating
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.400]   for people? Or you could ask, you know,
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.160]   when I'm thinking about whether I want to build a career as a brand marketer or a
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.920]   data engineer or whatever the career field is,
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.160]   you what do you think are some of the things that are really most enjoyable and
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.520]   exciting to you about the field?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.160]   And what are some of the things that are drawbacks or challenges that someone
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.000]   should be aware of?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.800]   I think if you give people a chance to answer both the good and the bad,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.560]   you tend to get much more honesty. And again,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.600]   honesty is what you're going for because you are ultimately usually in these
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.440]   conversations,
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.080]   trying to get the information that will help you decide if a particular career
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.760]   field or a particular company is going to be a good fit.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.480]   Yeah. I mean,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.680]   I think it's really important to realize that networking doesn't have to just be
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.400]   these big events with lots of people.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.800]   And there's a lot of value that can come from this one-on-one.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.920]   I'll share a couple of my tips because I really love the challenge of finding
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   email addresses and finding connections to people.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.640]   I feel like that's just a game that I really enjoy.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.800]   And so when I started thinking about how to do this kind of one-on-one
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.640]   networking,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.320]   first I would go to LinkedIn and I would look at all my connections and then I
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   would look at all their connections and I would just scroll through.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.000]   And so before I would meet with someone, I would go in with a list.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.720]   And sometimes I even printed it out depending on how well I knew them.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.320]   But I was like,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.360]   here are the seven people that this person knows that could be a good fit for me
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.440]   to meet. And so every time I went to one of those meetings,
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.840]   I would go and know who could I potentially be looking for an introduction
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.800]   for. And then I always have an idea of my network.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.680]   So who are you looking to meet and how could I add value back to you?
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.040]   That's when you know the person you're meeting with. When you don't,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.200]   sometimes you need to find an email address.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.560]   And so there are a bunch of browser extensions. I use one called Lucia,
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.280]   which basically like when you're on a LinkedIn profile will show you an email.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.720]   But the biggest trick I found that for validating emails is if you just search
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.080]   in Google for an email with quotes, you'll get, but it's not in quotes.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.120]   It always fails. But if it's in quotes,
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.040]   you usually get back whether that email is out there.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.600]   And I found emails in the strangest places.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.240]   So you just kind of like guess someone's email address, you know, for you,
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.320]   I would try, you know, first name, last name, first letter, last name,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.640]   all these different combinations.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.400]   And I've seen things pop up where there's like a random PTA agenda for some,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.360]   you know, school, but they're the coordinator.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.160]   And so their email is on this agenda.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.080]   And so when you're trying to find email addresses,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.600]   there's a lot of ways to be creative.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.640]   I love that.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.720]   Yeah. I mean, I go a little bit intense sometimes,
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.480]   because I want to make these events efficient. So if I go to an event,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.360]   one thing that I find that most people don't know you can do,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.040]   you can often email a conference and say, Hey,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.720]   do you have a list of the attendees? You don't need the email.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.680]   Sometimes they just include the email addresses, which is like, you know,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.640]   someone sent you a plate of gold. Sometimes they don't.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.200]   But I go through every conference or every event.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.160]   I try to find all the attendees, figure out who's interesting.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.840]   And sometimes I'll go one step further and I'll go to their LinkedIn profiles.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.480]   I'll copy their photos and I'll put them in a notes doc on my phone.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.400]   So when I'm like, okay, I'm going to go stand on the wall for a second,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.640]   look through this and try to identify who are these people I'm trying to meet.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.680]   And then I'll be like, there's Bill. And then I'm like, I'm like targeting,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.440]   I want to go talk to Bill. And I walk up there.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.640]   I love this so much by the way,
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.760]   because I think what you just gave is a mini masterclass on how
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.480]   to get the attention of people who are otherwise busy.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.720]   And you're completely right.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.360]   That being in the same place at the same time is one of the best ways I would
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.560]   say, you know, back when I used to attend a lot more conferences,
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.360]   my schedule was packed. But if someone said, Hey, Catherine,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   I'm also going to be where you already are.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.320]   Do you have 15 minutes during one of these breaks?
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.280]   I am probably about 30 times more likely to say yes,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.160]   than if it had just been a cold email asking for a phone call or something.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:01.760]   Likewise,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.960]   if you can find any other points of connection with that person through perhaps
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.640]   Googling them, talking them,
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.160]   it's such a great way to get on someone's radar. And I think that's brilliant.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   Yeah. So sometimes it can backfire. So when I was in college,
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.960]   I was applying for a job in New York and I was at home and I grew up like you
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.080]   did in Northern Virginia, right outside DC.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.480]   And there was a company in New York and I really wanted to work at this company.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.200]   And so I sent an email to the person that I'd been introduced to. And I said,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.400]   Hey, I'm in New York this week. And I, you know, it's four hours away.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.680]   I was like, would you be up for meeting up? And I thought, you know,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   if this person thinks I'm already there and I'm only there this week,
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.600]   there's a higher likelihood that they'd make the effort.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.640]   And I remember getting an email at like 10 PM that was like,
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.760]   could you come in at six tomorrow morning or seven?
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.880]   There's some really early time.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.040]   And so I literally took the 1am Amtrak up to New York,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.600]   got in at like 3.45 in the morning,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   went to a friend's house and took a shower and got all dressed up.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.640]   I put my suit on and, and showed up. And, you know,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.000]   only about six months later, did I actually say, you know,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I was actually not in New York at the time.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.800]   And the person thought it was funny, but it worked.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.360]   People love the hustle though, right? It really does.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.680]   That's actually how I got the URL, themuse.com.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.720]   The person who owned it was this amazing guy who lived in Washington,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.800]   DC, actually.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.960]   And I at the time was in San Francisco, California,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.880]   because I had just finished the Y Combinator Incubator Program for
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.600]   the Muse. And similarly,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.160]   I actually had gotten his email through some connection.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.200]   I had been emailing him, researching him, trying to get a meeting.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.640]   And finally I said, I'll be in DC this weekend. And somewhat similarly,
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.320]   he's like, great, how about Sunday morning at 10 AM?
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.120]   And it was a tight turnaround, but I was on a, I think,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.800]   a red eyes that Saturday night.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.280]   And I made the meeting and ended up getting the URL and bringing him on as an
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.720]   advisor.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.520]   So sometimes you just have to show up or pretend in this
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.000]   case that you are already there.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.080]   I know. Yeah.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.880]   So two things that you mentioned in your book that I thought were really
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.480]   interesting. I want to make sure I highlight one was in addition to these two
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.320]   sided questions, when you're networking,
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.160]   you mentioned asking open-ended questions. And I think I fail at this a lot,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.040]   but the tip I really loved is instead of saying,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.360]   do you like working at Google where someone can be like, yes. And then,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.880]   you know, there's nothing left. You could say, well,
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.920]   what's it like to work at Google? Do you, you know, what do you think?
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.120]   And that's a much longer answer.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.680]   And I think my brain when I'm in work mode is always in the,
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.240]   let's be efficient, let's be efficient.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.200]   But when it comes to building relationships,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.480]   the goal isn't to get to the end result as fast as possible.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.880]   It's to build the relationship.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.160]   So that's one tip that I really liked. And then I'll ask you this one.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.040]   This is where I feel like I fail.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.880]   I am terrible at just leaving a conversation in a professional
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.160]   setting where, you know, I've been there for, I'm trying to meet 10 people.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.800]   I've only got a couple hours.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.960]   Do you have any tips what to do when you're 15 minutes in,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.200]   you've made that relationship,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.120]   you've kind of set up maybe a next step and you're trying to get around the
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.400]   room and meet more people?
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.040]   Yeah. So first of all,
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   I think it can be helpful to recognize that often the other person is secretly
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.800]   thinking the same thing they're thinking I've loved this conversation,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.600]   but I could really use a refill on my drink or, you know,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.800]   I'd like to go chat with some others. So first of all,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.760]   if you are in an in-person setting,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.960]   I like to purposefully have as much as possible,
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.200]   a half empty drink or a nearly empty food plate.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.040]   So I can use that as an excuse. It's a universal human excuse. Oh,
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.680]   Chris, it's been great catching up, but I actually am going to go get a refill,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.360]   but I'll catch you later. Or, you know,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.680]   I think I'm going to go try more of that guacamole. I don't know. I love food.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.000]   I'm very food motivated. I find that people tend to react really well.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.440]   If there's no food or drinks or you have a full drink, that's not an option.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.200]   I think sometimes you can just be really kind, but direct.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.440]   Maybe they've told you about something, let's say a work accomplishment,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.000]   you know, wow, that's, that's really incredible. You must be really proud.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.080]   Well, I'd love to hear more about that.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.320]   I actually need to walk around the room quickly and there's a few people I need
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.280]   to catch up with, but,
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.880]   but let's swap information and maybe we can follow up later on.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.160]   Or I think sometimes just saying that I've really loved talking to you,
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.600]   but I would love to continue this later.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.560]   And as much as it can be awkward to do often,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.920]   the other person is grateful. And in fact,
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.720]   if I'm speaking with someone who's much more important than me, for example,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.120]   a speaker at a conference, or, you know, when I've met, you know,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.840]   various tech celebrities,
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.400]   I always make a point of ending the conversation first because no one ever does
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.920]   it with them. And it's such a power move to be talking to, you know, Elon Musk.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.120]   It'd be like, well, it was amazing getting to meet you,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   but I'm going to go grab another drink, but hopefully see you around people.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.560]   I find it's actually whatever the situation,
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.000]   it can be such a great way of acknowledging the other person's time.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.360]   And the fact that they likely have a long agenda,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.920]   if the conversation is meant to continue,
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.040]   you can find each other later at the event or in a separate follow-on.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.680]   Yeah. Yeah. And those follow-ons, I tend to say,
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.480]   try to come up with some next step. If you want to meet this person,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.840]   as opposed to waiting,
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.600]   people are always more willing to commit to things in person.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.160]   So if you're trying to get someone to introduce you to someone person at their
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.440]   company or a friend of theirs,
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.400]   just ask because if you wait until you send an email,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.280]   it's so easy for someone to say no. But if you say, Hey,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.960]   would you be willing to introduce me to this person? People are really,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.040]   really uncomfortable saying no in person.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.120]   So that's also something I always suggest in person.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.000]   Yes. And definitely just head on.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.440]   I think the importance of following up saying, you know, the next day,
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.840]   sometimes even that, that same day, sending a quick email.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.960]   So great to talk to you, you know, as we discussed, I'd love to X, Y, Z,
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.680]   putting it in writing, getting that quick follow-up.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.920]   Often I find I'll need to send a second note a few days later because many
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.840]   people get backlogged on email right after they speak or when they're at an
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.880]   event, but that's okay.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.200]   I think it's just helpful to really be fairly quick with that follow-up while
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.080]   things are still fresh.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.520]   And ideally while they're still feeling the enthusiasm of the human connection
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.280]   of the conversation that you two had.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   So don't follow any dating rules. Don't wait seven days.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.040]   Just follow up quick.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.280]   Yeah, absolutely. I think that, you know,
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.400]   there are many parallels between dating and professional connections,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.120]   but I absolutely think that this is not one you don't want to play too hard to
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:28.560]   get,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.240]   especially if you're in the position of looking to build your network,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.120]   looking to meet new people, you know,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.160]   people often respond very favorably to the kind of clearly expressed
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.720]   intention that you admire their career.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.280]   You'd like to get to know them better or learn from them or something like that.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.400]   So it's not a time to beat around the bush.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.160]   Yeah, totally.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.920]   So I want to, before we jump into kind of actually finding opportunities that
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.760]   could be interesting,
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.040]   there's a part of the book that talks about building your personal brand.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.680]   And when I hear someone talk about building their personal brand,
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.960]   my immediate reaction is, "Oh, I've got to go become a YouTube influencer.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.640]   And I have to start creating video content every day and posting on social
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.800]   media." Is it really about all of that? Or does it have to be about all that?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.760]   No, it does not.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.360]   But I love that because you're exactly right that many people have this
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.720]   idea that having a personal brand is synonymous with
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.360]   being an influencer or spending hours every week crafting an online
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.920]   persona. The fact is you have a personal brand,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.680]   whether you've thought about it or not, everyone does.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.440]   Your personal brand is how people talk about you when you're not in the room.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.760]   And it's sometimes uncomfortable to think about that.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.960]   But every single one of us is referred to or discussed in various
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.640]   casual ways by colleagues, by bosses, by others when we're not there.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.120]   And so I like to think about it, first of all, as this question,
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.880]   what do you want to be known for? So what are the attributes,
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.560]   the adjectives and the accomplishments that you want people to think of
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.840]   when they say your name? And, you know,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.600]   if you want to think about building a personal brand, again,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.200]   this doesn't have to be an arduous process,
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.480]   but I think it is really,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.840]   really important in today's world because of how interconnected we are
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.000]   on social media,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.760]   because of the way that your reputation is going to precede you in so many
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.480]   different aspects of your professional career and frankly,
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.000]   your personal life as well. And so, again,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.080]   just like I talked about the beginning of a job search is often that period of
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.000]   self-reflection or self-discovery.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.720]   I think that a good personal brand exploration starts the same way.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.280]   Just thinking, what do I want to be known for? If you have the time,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.680]   I love to recommend that you ask colleagues, bosses, friends,
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.360]   what do you think I'm known for?
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.640]   What do you think are some of the adjectives people would use to describe me?
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.200]   What are some of my strengths?
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.120]   And then ideally think about a few key words or phrases that
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.240]   are really important. Maybe it's around your creativity.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.200]   Maybe it's your consistency and dependability.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.400]   Maybe it's your financial acumen, your sort of, you know,
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.480]   facility with numbers, like whatever it is,
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.280]   just getting really clear about how you want to be known is step one.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.440]   And then thinking about how you consistently communicate that, you know,
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.480]   a very baseline place is your social profiles, your LinkedIn, your Twitter,
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   your Instagram. If you have them,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.320]   I think it's important also to know that that you should have them consistency,
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.040]   but that doesn't mean sameness.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.440]   So every profile shouldn't look exactly the same because you know,
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.920]   because they're not the same platforms, right?
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.080]   If I showed up exactly the same way on Instagram that I do on LinkedIn,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.160]   one of those would be a really awkward fit,
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.960]   but I should clearly seem like the same person with some of the same key
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.280]   values. So whether that's authenticity, you know,
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   my interest in the future of work and talent,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   just really being deliberate and specific,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.320]   making sure that you have a reasonably good photo of yourself on each platform.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.640]   I think that can be very helpful.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.400]   And then I would really recommend that people consider a personal website.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.600]   Now, of course it depends on what you do.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.840]   It's not as relevant for every career field, but it really,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.720]   you can think of it as a piece of real estate on the internet where you can say
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.440]   exactly what you want about who you are and what you're good at.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.920]   Just gives you a little bit more space to talk about key accomplishments,
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.400]   share examples of your work. If it's digitally available,
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.200]   perhaps include video clips or again,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   just a bit of additional text and give people a way to get in contact with you.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.360]   That is not just a Twitter DM or LinkedIn in mail.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.160]   So we have a lot of tips on the muse for specifically how to think about building
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.000]   a personal website,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.800]   but I think that they can be a really,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.640]   really powerful and they're often underused. And also, again,
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.600]   if you're reaching out to industry influencers or others to set up networking
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.160]   events, informational interviews,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.400]   being able to link to a few key places online that very clearly
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.480]   and concisely give a sense of, again, who you are, what you stand for,
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.320]   what you're known for is really important.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.960]   If you want people to respond to your email. So is it your LinkedIn profile?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   That is that kind of key best thing. Is it a personal website?
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.400]   Maybe if you're a creative, it's your Tik TOK, whatever it is,
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.200]   just really know that you're crafting it so that someone gets as
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.920]   accurate an impression of you as possible in a fairly short amount of time
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.280]   and know that people are going to be Googling you all the time for professional
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.560]   opportunities for personal opportunities. So the more, again,
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.000]   that you can be intentional about how you show up online, the better.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.080]   I think sometimes people think they have to go write blog posts and create
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.920]   content to manage their brand.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.680]   But for the longest time I had my name.com and it was literally just a
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.360]   website that had some social links and three sentences about me in a photo.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.200]   And, you know, the crazy thing was, if you search for my name,
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.800]   now that's one of the things that pops up.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.320]   It's this website that didn't have a lot of information on it,
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:06.040]   but just gave people a very easy way to find you
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.360]   and links in your email address and that kind of stuff,
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.240]   which comes up with another question, you know, maybe 20 years ago,
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.680]   it wouldn't have been a thing. But nowadays,
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.120]   I think with so many social platforms and employers, you know,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.600]   Googling employees, is it now okay to have pictures of,
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.760]   of yourself just having a good time on the internet and are all employers okay
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.680]   with that? Or are certain industries a little turned off by that?
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.800]   Or what's the latest policy on what you post on Instagram or Twitter?
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Yeah. So I love that you asked this because it is a constantly changing
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.480]   answer as sort of society adapts to the
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.800]   proliferation of images and video and information on social.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.280]   I would say first of all that most employers recognize that you and me,
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.080]   like we're humans, we have fun, we see friends, we socialize,
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.480]   we might drink an alcoholic beverage.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.520]   So I think it's important to use your judgment for the majority of industries
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.920]   and the majority of employers,
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.360]   casual photos of someone drinking or having fun on a social platform are not
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.800]   going to be a problem at all. That said,
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.880]   there's a few exceptions and certain industries are more,
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.280]   more strict. And I can talk about that in a second,
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.400]   but you know,
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.520]   if you had a photo of yourself doing a keg stand or some sort of like extreme
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.040]   drinking event,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.560]   I'd probably recommend if you're thinking about changing jobs that you consider
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.440]   taking it down or at least removing your name.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.080]   If you have some very incendiary or controversial political views,
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.240]   that can be another thing that can hamper you in a job search.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.240]   Now some people decide this is me and I don't want to be hired by someone who has
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.360]   a problem with anything I say or do online.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.880]   And that is an acceptable approach. But if you don't feel that way,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.200]   if you want to think about this as, you know, that's my personal life,
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.000]   but I don't want it to interfere with my job,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.960]   then I often recommend do a Google search on yourself,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.600]   look at your social profiles and just, you know,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.080]   think about are there things that might, that might really surprise someone.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.520]   Now a few industries,
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.560]   a financial services can be a bit more particular when it comes to a social
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.280]   events on social media,
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.000]   things like client service or therapists where it's one-on-one again, it's,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   it's very complicated because you still have in some cases a generation that
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.840]   didn't grow up with their lives online judging a generation that did.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.280]   So that adds some complexity because it's very easy to throw stones about social
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.520]   media. If you know,
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.640]   Facebook and Instagram didn't come around until you were in your mid to late
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.080]   thirties. But at the same time, I think by and large,
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.000]   hiring managers are much more relaxed about this type of thing than they were in
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.040]   the past. And they're not going to begrudge someone who's, you know,
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.640]   having a good time, enjoying themselves,
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.200]   unless it sort of crosses a line that I would say is, is again, you know,
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.680]   pretty extreme drinking, uh, very controversial statements.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.520]   That is probably where I would, I would suggest like,
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.040]   just unless you really feel committed to it, just take your name off it, you know,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.280]   make it, make it a little bit less because job searching is already hard enough.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.560]   And do you really want to worry?
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.920]   Did I not get that interview because of how I answered that second question or
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.640]   because they saw this diatribe that I went on? And again,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.960]   I find that personally,
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.080]   I like to keep the focus on my professional skills and abilities and not so much
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.760]   on, on things that might be controversial.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.400]   Totally agree. I, one tip is if you're trying to Google yourself,
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.320]   make sure you do it from an incognito window,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.080]   because sometimes you'll search and the results will be different than if someone
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.520]   else was, yes, that is an important one, by the way. And I tend to say, you know,
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.760]   go two to three pages potentially into your results.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.360]   You don't necessarily need to go 10.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.320]   If somebody is 10 pages deep on your results,
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.560]   they're really doing a forensic audit.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.680]   You can if you're concerned about what's there,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   but most employers are looking at the first page of Google,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.320]   maybe the first two, very rarely the third. It's,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.640]   it's unusual in my experience that someone will go any deeper than that.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   So that's, that's a lot about how you can prepare before you're kind of ready
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.320]   for this.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.920]   This is stuff you can do when you're not even looking for a job when you have
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.760]   more free time.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.040]   But if you start thinking about what you want to do next and you have a few
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.880]   ideas,
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.280]   what do you think is the right approach today in this kind of modern
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.800]   workplace to find opportunities?
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.960]   I like to recommend a three pronged approach because I think it's helpful to
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.880]   have a few different irons in the fire when you're thinking about changing a
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.680]   job. So first and foremost,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.880]   I do think the use of specialized job sites,
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.360]   obviously I run one, the muse.com. So I'm not unbiased here,
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.920]   but focused sites like the muse that give you access to, you know,
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.560]   a really diverse set of offerings that let you see jobs, you know,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.680]   on our site, for example, you can search for jobs by, do they have, you know,
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.800]   maternity or paternity leave? Do they offer tuition reimbursement?
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.400]   Like it's a good way to get a broad sense of a lot of opportunities in the
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.840]   market, including things that you may not have heard of.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.360]   So I think that's one step and we can talk more about that.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.760]   Second is specific company websites and social media. So, you know,
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.400]   are there places that are already on your radar as a companies you might want to
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.360]   work for, follow them on social,
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.480]   look to see if they have job search specific social channels. For example,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.360]   I think NPR has at NPR jobs on Twitter, just, just about working at NPR.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:33.320]   A lot of companies have kind of focused social media handles just on both their
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.720]   employee experience and the roles that they're hiring for looking on the company
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.120]   websites and understanding,
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.240]   is there a talent pool to sign up for because some companies actually end up
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.960]   searching internal talent pools or lists of people who have expressed interest
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.880]   in working at that company before they post roles externally.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.040]   So having a short list of companies that you're interested in getting on their
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.960]   radar, definitely helpful. And then finally your network. And, you know,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.800]   we talked about this from the perspective of building your network the
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.320]   perspective of having informational interviews,
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.760]   but it's very helpful regardless of where you are in your career to tap your
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.640]   network for potential job opportunities.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.720]   One thing I like to do is a group email because I think that an individual email
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.760]   one-on-one can be great for people, you know, really well,
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.800]   but for people who you're less close to,
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.680]   sometimes people don't know how to handle it if they don't personally feel
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.600]   comfortable or know you well enough to help.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.640]   So I like sometimes sending a BCC email to a small group of people that says,
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.200]   you know, friends, if you're on this list,
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.720]   it's because I really value your professional opinion.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.840]   And I wanted to enlist your help in my upcoming job search.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.160]   This is a really great opportunity to be very clear about that personal brand,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.800]   those personal brand attributes and adjectives that we talked about before.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.680]   So you want to concisely explain what it is that you're very good at,
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.080]   what it is that you're looking for and how your network can help. So, you know,
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.720]   I am a healthcare administrator with X years of experience. I focus on this,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.600]   my peers and previous managers would say that I excel at this.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.400]   That by the way,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.400]   is one of my favorite tips in interviewing as well as in outreach emails is,
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.160]   and again,
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.800]   it has to be honest because many of these people may know or talk to your peers
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.880]   and former managers and you don't want to be caught in any sort of falsehood.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.960]   But for things that are true for things that you hear often, rather than saying,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.640]   you know, I am great at this, people think I am this,
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:34.880]   being able to say colleagues and managers frequently describe me as XYZ listing
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.640]   out some of those adjectives or talking about some of your accomplishments that
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.280]   others would verify is helpful. And then I would say,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.440]   give your network specific ways that they can help.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.000]   I like to keep the body of the email short and sweet and say, you know,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.920]   read on below my signature for a list of example companies I'm interested in and
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.120]   more details. But really you can, you know,
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:57.640]   this is an opportunity to ask for introductions at specific dream employers,
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   list out some of the types of jobs you're looking for. And this can be really,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.240]   really effective tool if used well,
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.480]   but I would say generally you want to send maybe one of these per person per job
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:14.720]   search. So it can be less useful if you're following up with people again and
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.800]   again and again, Hey, help me.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.320]   Cause you never want your network to feel like you're pushing the responsibility
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.840]   of you getting a job on them.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.040]   Yeah. And I've found when you're sending these emails,
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.120]   sometimes I'll go as far as to say, Hey,
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.880]   if you want to introduce me to someone here is a blurb of text at the bottom of
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.760]   the email that says, Hey, I want to introduce you to Chris.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.960]   He's looking for this, you know, here's a little blurb of his background.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.560]   Try to make it as easy as possible for the person that wants to help because
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.560]   they're already going to be doing work for you.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.240]   And if you can make it less work, they're just more likely to help.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.200]   Yes, I completely agree. I love that.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.320]   When people reach out to me and say, Catherine, I'm looking for X, you know,
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.720]   who can you introduce me to?
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.440]   That's sometimes a much harder question to answer than when someone's like
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.960]   Catherine, I'm looking for this. I noticed in your network,
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.840]   you're connected to these seven people. Who are you comfortable passing me on?
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.720]   Can I write a blurb for you to use? You know,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.680]   just make it as easy for them as possible because most of the people you're
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.080]   asking are really busy. Generally, you know,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.440]   we have hundreds of undone tasks on our to-do list.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.120]   And so the more that you help someone help you,
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.480]   the more likely they are to do it.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.160]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.440]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.040]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.600]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.760]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.120]   So you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.920]   the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.120]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade,
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.920]   sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.360]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.400]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade,
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.560]   but this last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe,
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.520]   it's called bark the moon and it's so delicious.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.640]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription right now,
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.080]   trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.560]   When you visit all the hacks.com/trade,
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.640]   that's all the hacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.680]   plans, all the hacks.com/trade.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:39.840]   Do you all remember episode one 22,
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.760]   when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.240]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.480]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit,
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.000]   I was a skeptic at first,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.680]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from any day,
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.440]   I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.800]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.240]   scratch in the microwave.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.960]   And honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.040]   simplifies the process so much.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.080]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.760]   store and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.560]   freezer and oven safe too.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.000]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.280]   I highly recommend David Chang's salmon rice. It is so good.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.040]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection they launched last
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   year, you have to check it out. So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.800]   And sometimes if I didn't want to bother people in my network for something,
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.200]   or I found that I'm making too many requests,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.720]   I'll just find the email address of the person I'm trying to be introduced to.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.200]   And I won't say that this person has endorsed this introduction,
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.360]   but I'll mention in the email, I'm like, Hey,
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.080]   it looks like we're both connected to Catherine. That's great.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.800]   It's better than a cold email, but not as good as a warm intro,
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.480]   but it's somewhere in the middle. So you can do that.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.600]   Even if someone doesn't have the time to help out.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.480]   Yes. And again, you brought up a really great point,
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   which is people are more likely to answer you or to help you if you have common
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:48.400]   points of interest or people in common. So whether it's someone you both know,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.520]   a school you both went to, even an interest you both had.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.680]   When I was telling the story earlier about how I got the muse.com URL,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.560]   one of the things I did when I was researching the gentleman who had it is
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   realized that he had worked in a global health in Newfoundland and I had worked
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.000]   in global health in East Africa.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.280]   And there were some interesting parallels between this past experience.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.480]   He had this past experience I had.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.400]   And so given that I didn't have any connections to him, when I reached out,
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:21.520]   I was able to write my email in a way that highlighted some of the shared
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.200]   things that we seemed to care about from our online profile. So like you said,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.920]   it's less good than a warm intro from someone who knows and loves and respects
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.800]   you both, but much better than a cold email. I mean,
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.320]   I get at least 10 emails a week. Hi Catherine, can I pick your brain?
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.240]   But you know,
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.640]   they're all fighting with each other for a very limited amount of brain space.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.600]   And the ones that have warm connections or shared points of interest or
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.720]   experience are much more likely to get answered.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.480]   Yeah. And if we go through the arc of this process,
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.960]   you've figured out how to get in touch with people.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.560]   You've started to figure out what you care about.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.280]   Maybe you've identified a few companies.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.440]   Obviously if there is a job posting that you're qualified for and that you're
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.480]   excited about, you know, you could apply online.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.800]   I would treat that personally as the last resort to being able to find someone at
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:13.160]   the company that could refer you. What about when there's not a job posted?
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.240]   If you found a company and you're like, I'm very excited to work here,
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.560]   but there's not something on their careers page or listed anywhere.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560]   What do you tell people to do?
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:24.520]   Yeah, absolutely. That happens frequently, by the way, most companies,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.040]   especially small companies want to hear from you directly. Larger companies,
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.920]   it can be a bit more complicated because they often are so deluged by applicants
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.960]   that they set up guardrails and blockages. But I would say, first of all,
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.400]   look to see again, like we were saying,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.360]   do you have anyone in your network who works at this company or is connected to
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.760]   someone who works at this company?
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:50.200]   Can you get connected to someone who you can say,
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.880]   I'm really interested in what your company does.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.920]   I'm excited about working for you. Are there opportunities? You know,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.040]   here's what I'm good at. For larger companies,
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.320]   they sometimes have what's called a talent network, which I mentioned earlier,
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.680]   where you can send in a general application,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.920]   which essentially describes who you are, what you're good at,
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.760]   what you're sort of known for and your skills are,
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.960]   and then stays in their database.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.400]   But I find that if you can go in through someone directly,
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.320]   that's always the best move. But actually I would say, and this sort of,
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.760]   I maybe push back a little bit on the point you said before,
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.920]   I think sometimes doing more than one thing is best.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.640]   So even if you know someone,
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   I would often tell people apply to the talent network as well, because,
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.560]   you know, worst case, you're just duplicating your efforts. Best case,
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.760]   it's another way in another point of contact. Similarly,
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.000]   when you think about online job sites, you know,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.040]   they get a bad rap because like Indeed is the biggest one, right?
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.520]   Our data right now from a bunch of our customers shows that on average,
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.480]   employers are making about one hire for every 600 applicants from
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.920]   Indeed. So no wonder it feels like it's just going into a black hole. But for,
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.200]   you know, a lot of focus sites like the Muse,
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   the ratio is like one to 100 or one to 200.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.000]   It still means there's a lot of competition.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.520]   It's still best if you have a human intro or a connection. But even, you know,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.280]   if somebody reaches out to me through a referral, Oh, you know,
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.160]   Chris is great at this. Like, you know, you,
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.320]   you guys should talk to him for that role you're hiring for.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:28.200]   I often will still ask the person to apply as well through our
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.440]   online postings so that they're in our systems.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:35.280]   And I think I often say like you can't go wrong by doing a mix of
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.240]   both sometimes at the same company.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.240]   Cause I think the latest statistics I've heard are that 56% of
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.560]   all jobs are filled today through online job postings.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.920]   So while I would always recommend that people do their best to find the
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.560]   connection, do the informational interview, you know, network your way in,
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.720]   it is certainly a higher likelihood way of success.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.960]   There are a lot of jobs that get filled from online pools.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:04.040]   And so I think it's helpful to think about both because particularly for people
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.600]   that don't have a strong of a network, I think that you can,
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.480]   sometimes people despair. They're like,
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.960]   I'll never get the job if I don't have a connection.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.280]   And that's actually not true. Again,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.200]   if you have an opportunity to make a connection, do it.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.320]   And when you get further along in your career,
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.120]   the closer you are to an executive or a senior role,
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.200]   the more important connections become the earlier you are in your career,
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.680]   the more jobs tend to get filled through online portals,
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.320]   company websites, et cetera,
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.840]   partially because of just the volume of roles being hired.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.560]   But I think that being really thoughtful about multiple channels is helpful.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.080]   And again, you will ultimately,
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.400]   if you especially are excited about particular opportunities,
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.120]   you want to maximize your chance of success.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.960]   Yeah. And if there's no job posting, I wouldn't be afraid to just reach out.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.280]   I know there was a company I really wanted to work at at one point called Simple
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.000]   Geo, and there was no job opening.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.680]   And I just decided that this is the company I want to work at.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.240]   And instead of applying to 20 jobs,
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.920]   I overcommitted to this and I emailed everyone I knew that knew the company.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.640]   Finally, someone said they'd forward an email to one of the founders.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.160]   And I said, "Hey, I really want to work at your company. Here's what I do.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.600]   Can I give you a presentation on why you should consider talking to me?"
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.280]   And they gave me 15 minutes and I gave a presentation to one of the founders of
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.440]   the company and kind of convinced them that they should consider hiring me.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.480]   They ended up hiring me to do a freelance project that eventually became a job.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.960]   But I think people maybe don't always realize how valuable
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.400]   passion for the company is as an attribute of a candidate.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.880]   And when I'm looking to hire people at Wealthfront,
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.440]   when I see people email me and I can just tell that they're excited about the
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.520]   product, they're excited about working here, they've done their homework,
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.200]   it bubbles them up to the top of the list.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.240]   Not that I would hire them over a more qualified candidate,
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.040]   but I would definitely want to talk to them knowing that they're so excited.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.160]   And sometimes that happens for roles that we know we're going to hire for in the
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.400]   future, but we don't have listed.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.080]   So if you're really, really excited about a company,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.240]   I wouldn't let the fact that there's not an opening now dissuade you from
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.040]   reaching out and applying for a job that doesn't exist.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:19.240]   Yes. Because I think that, again, when you're in the job search seat,
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.840]   you can be really fixated on like,
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.200]   how am I going to convince the right company to hire me?
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.400]   But it's helpful to remember that companies are sitting there thinking, wow,
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.760]   how are we going to get the right people for all this work that we have to do?
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.400]   And if you can show up to a company and demonstrate that you might be the right
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   person and that you have that passion and that commitment, as you said,
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.600]   they're in some cases, very incentivized to create a role for you,
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:50.560]   to accelerate a role that maybe they'd been planning to hire for in two or three
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.400]   months, but suddenly a great candidate shows up, you know,
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.800]   who wouldn't want to just fill the role if they have the budget now to do so.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.720]   So I couldn't agree more. And actually I was,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.440]   I was trying to flip through the pages of my book to find this specific email
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.200]   that I got early on in the muse.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.560]   I had been thinking about hiring someone in marketing.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.640]   I'd actually been talking to a woman that I thought was interesting.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.800]   And right when it started to fall through and it seemed like maybe she wasn't
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.200]   actually going to be the right fit.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.520]   I got a cold email from someone who had seen me speak at a conference and
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.120]   essentially said, I love your company. I believe in the mission.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.560]   I want to be part of it. Exactly like you said, here's, here's who I am.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.240]   Here's what I'm good at. You know, if you ever need help,
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.880]   if you ever need consulting, if I can ever be of assistance,
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.440]   if there's ever a role, like I am on board, I want this.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.280]   And I responded, you know,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.320]   a day or so later and I was like actually thinking about hiring a marketer.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.800]   And that guy Elliot worked for the muse for years after that.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.600]   And it was such a core part of our early growth. And it's all because like you
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.200]   said, we didn't have a role posted, but he reached out.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   Yeah. I've, I've hired multiple people for that. I've done that myself.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.640]   Big fan of that approach. So you, you wrote a whole book about this.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.440]   We could spend another hour on interviewing and negotiating.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.160]   So I'll ask a few tactical questions just to kind of fly through things.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.120]   Is there an interview question you think even the most senior candidates always
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.240]   get wrong? Well,
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.000]   everybody struggles with tell me about your biggest weakness,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.120]   because it can be such a hard and
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.200]   vulnerable thing to cop to your true biggest weakness. Frankly,
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.120]   some people don't know it.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.480]   And I would say that's the biggest problem is when people are not self-aware
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   enough to know their biggest weakness.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.480]   I think it is important to be honest because good interviewers are looking for
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.080]   self-awareness at the same time,
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.920]   recognize that if your biggest weakness overlaps with one of the most important
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.360]   criteria for doing this job, well, you will probably not get the job,
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.680]   but frankly, you probably shouldn't get that job.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.600]   So I think that there's a way to answer that question that can focus on
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.320]   an area. That's a known weakness, what you've done to mitigate it,
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.120]   why you're committed to improving it.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.880]   And ideally have it be something that's a true weakness.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.240]   That is not a core need for the role you're interviewing for,
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.560]   because that can make it very,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.920]   very hard for an interviewer to feel comfortable giving you the job.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.680]   I've been surprised how often candidates,
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.240]   even senior candidates will not do a good job of answering,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.840]   why do you want to work here or what attracted you to this company?
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.080]   If the answer feels trite, if it feels very surface level,
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.080]   it's so much less compelling than someone who is immediately
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.920]   clear why this company is so exciting for them.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.360]   It's kind of like we were joking before about areas where job search is not
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.680]   similar to dating. This is one where it is very similar.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.920]   People don't want to date someone who just wants a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   That's not very appealing.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.000]   You want someone who's specifically interested in you.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.160]   And for many interviewers is exactly the same.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.160]   They want the candidate to have done deep research and to really clearly be
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.800]   able to articulate why this company, why this role. So that's another one.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.680]   I mean, honestly, interviewing is tricky.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.120]   It's one of the things we have,
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.640]   I would guess probably 3000 interviewing articles on themuse.com,
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:17.240]   but partially it's, you know, we've got articles for different functional areas,
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.200]   different types of questions, different seniorities. It is a challenge.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:20.840]   And I think, you know,
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.480]   I do recommend people practice a bit if you haven't interviewed in a while just
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.920]   to get some of the kinks out. But at the same time,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.760]   the interviewer generally wants to find someone great.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.920]   They want you to do well. So I think that's an important thing to keep in mind.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.720]   Yeah. We will link to some of these articles in the show notes for people looking
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.200]   for them. Okay. Few last quick things. When people find that job,
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.080]   do you think negotiating is something that people should be doing more of?
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.200]   Yes, I do.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.400]   Although I think you can take cues from the employer on which of the
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.800]   many different areas to negotiate our best. So first of all,
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.920]   most of the time when an employer gives an initial offer,
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   it is negotiable unless they very explicitly say that this is, for example,
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.320]   the same offer we give every single person in this role.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.400]   Or if you're being hired for a role,
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.240]   that's one of a number of identical things, be it customer service reps,
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.040]   consultants at a large consulting firm, et cetera.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.440]   Sometimes there's low flexibility, but for most companies, most roles,
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.400]   imagine there's at least five to 10% flexibility in the first salary number that
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   you're offered. And I think it generally doesn't hurt to say, first of all,
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.080]   thank you so much for the offer. I'm very excited about the company,
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.920]   but I just need to take a day or two to consider a few things.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.160]   You know, can I come back to you?
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.280]   Sometimes that's helpful for people who are not as comfortable negotiating as
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.360]   immediately going into a negotiation and lets you really sit back and think,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.200]   what do I want to ask for? How do I want to ask for it?
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.880]   And then I often recommend that people lay out a few different things.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.800]   So first of all, what's your desired salary range?
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.360]   You can do some research on various online platforms to understand what
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.760]   other companies might be paying for this role.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.000]   Know that different platforms do have very different ranges.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.680]   We find that when we benchmark that certain platforms are consistently higher
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.640]   than others in terms of their ideal or their kind of target salary ranges.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.440]   So I suggest check out a few,
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.560]   but I think it is very common and often expected that
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.360]   you go back to the hiring manager. Again,
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.800]   I always recommend that you first start by really reiterating
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.880]   how appreciative or excited you are. You know,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.280]   you want the conversation to feel like you're two future great collaborators
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.040]   working in unison towards the ideal outcome,
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.120]   which is that you join the company and everyone's happy. So, you know,
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.080]   thank you so much. I really appreciated this.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.200]   I wanted to come back and talk about salary.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.280]   I'd be really excited to accept this role.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.360]   If you could get in the range of X or based on my research,
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.640]   I've seen benchmarks for this role that are in a range of Y.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.480]   Do you think that's something you can do?
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.440]   The more that you can make it a collaborative process and less like an
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.240]   ultimatum, the more likely it is to start the relationship off on the right foot.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.440]   It's also helpful to understand internally,
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.480]   is this a question of I would take this role no matter what,
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.960]   and I just want to try and negotiate for a slightly higher base,
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.280]   which I absolutely would encourage you to do. Or is this,
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.480]   I would only take this role if they can meet certain criteria,
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.080]   knowing that internally helps you frame your negotiation.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.680]   And it also minimizes unpleasant surprises.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.360]   If you do end up unintentionally communicating that you absolutely must have a
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.520]   company get to a certain number to say yes, and then they don't get there.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.640]   And they're like, okay, sorry,
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.040]   we offered the job to someone else and you're heartbroken.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.160]   So I think it's important to advocate for yourself,
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.000]   but also understand what is the outcome you're looking for.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.560]   It's also important to remember. It's not just salary.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.480]   People think negotiation salary and yes, that's very important.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.800]   And I would absolutely start there, but you can also negotiate other things.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.320]   One executive that I know negotiated a $10,000 conference
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.560]   budget as part of her compensation,
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.560]   because the company was unable to go too much higher on her base comp
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.280]   because they didn't want her to be out of range with other execs,
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.560]   but they gave her a $10,000 budget to have travel hotels
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.800]   and conference fees,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.280]   which she used to go to incredible conferences all over the world.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.360]   She was also able to, I believe,
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.080]   negotiate student loan payment reimbursement and a number of other bells and
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.320]   whistles that were separate from base comp.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.560]   Companies sometimes are also more willing to give you bonus comp instead of
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.920]   base. So if let's say you want 20 K higher,
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.480]   they come back that they can't do more than 10. It's, you know,
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.880]   it's often acceptable to ask,
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.160]   could you add five to $10,000 to the end of your bonus or even your signing
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.240]   bonus? Yes, absolutely. That's a great point. Signing bonus, relocation bonus.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.440]   Sometimes companies just want to be able to say that everyone in this role is
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.880]   between X and Y thousand dollars of base, but if they really want you,
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.680]   they're motivated to find a way to make, to make things work.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.760]   The one thing I would say that I would also just caution people to avoid is
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.720]   sometimes you can sour an employer if they feel like it's a,
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.320]   and one more thing situation. So I think it's helpful if you say, Hey,
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.080]   I'm really excited about this, but I just need you to get to this number.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.280]   If they come back and get to that number,
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.200]   they're expecting that you're going to say ideally yes,
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.760]   or maybe you might say I ended up going with another opportunity. That's fine.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.400]   But I wouldn't at that point,
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.680]   come back and be like, thanks for giving me what I asked. And one more thing,
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.920]   especially if you do that two or three times,
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.280]   that's when I've seen sometimes company is sour on a candidate.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.160]   If they feel like the person is not being straightforward and direct in their
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.000]   negotiating.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.040]   And I would just double down that if you're negotiating with your future boss,
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.800]   that I would, I would just emphasize that point even more,
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.760]   because if you're negotiating with a recruiter,
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.400]   you might not engage with them regularly.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.760]   If you're negotiating with your boss,
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.000]   building a relationship that will hopefully last for a while.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.520]   Yes, yes, yes, yes. I would add plus a hundred to that.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.200]   Ideally this is a long-term relationship where they are going to be a huge
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.960]   advocate and supporter of yours. And so again,
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.240]   making it feel during the negotiation,
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.920]   like you're on the same side of the table,
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.080]   trying to mutually get to a great goal is going to be much better for that
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.720]   relationship than setting something up that feels adversarial.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.840]   Yeah. Well, so part three of your book, which we won't get into at all,
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.720]   it's all about charting your course through the workplace after you're working
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.440]   there.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.560]   And I had intended to try to get to a bunch of questions about communicating with
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.000]   people, getting raises and promotions, but I'll just have to say,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.560]   check out the book or we'll have you back another time,
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.360]   but it wouldn't be all the hacks if we didn't end asking for your favorite kind
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.600]   of work life productivity hacks. There are a few in the book,
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   but I'd love to hear what your favorites are.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.640]   Oh my goodness. Well,
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.520]   I'm a huge lover of pocket to save articles that I want to
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.080]   read later. My favorite job search hack. And actually I would say this,
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.000]   this can apply to promotions as well,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.400]   which I know we're not getting into in depth,
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.960]   but I think it can be really useful to print out some job
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.760]   descriptions for a role you'd like to have in one to three years.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   And then use two highlighters, one to highlight the skills you have today,
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.800]   and one to highlight the skills or experiences that you'd like to acquire in the
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.160]   next one to three years so that you can be a good fit for those roles.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.160]   It's a great way of being really intentional about where you are in your career,
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.280]   what you have today versus where you want to go.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.640]   And then you can use that to raise your hand at work for opportunities or offer
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:42.000]   in some cases to take on outside projects that might really well position you
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.800]   for those titles, you know, you're going to be going after in one to three years.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.440]   So that's a good muse hack.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.920]   Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being here. This was awesome.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.880]   I really appreciate your time.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.520]   And where can people find you and everything you're working on online?
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.640]   So the muse website is just the muse.com.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.400]   That is the biggest repository of career advice, articles,
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.280]   insight into companies and their values and cultures, job search. For me,
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.400]   you can find me on Twitter @kaymin, Instagram @kayminshu.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.880]   Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the exact same handle.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.600]   You can stalk me on LinkedIn, just Katherine Minshu. And yeah,
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.000]   I love hearing from people and please follow the muse,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.040]   check me out and hopefully we'll do another one of these sometime soon.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.760]   Sounds great. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.680]   Awesome. Thank you. This was a ton of fun.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.960]   That was so much fun.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.680]   I hope that even if you're not looking to change jobs right now,
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.840]   you learned something valuable.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.480]   Do you have any suggestions for a guest or a topic in a future show?
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.720]   Please let me know. And if you have a minute,
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.960]   I would really appreciate a few seconds of your time to give a vote to All The

[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:02.640]   soon.

[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.600]   Thanks so much for listening. See you next week.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   [inaudible]
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:36.560]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.200]   money.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.680]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.840]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast and it's much more about building
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.720]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.800]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.080]   It's hosted by my good friend Andrew who truly believes that everyone in this
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.400]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.040]   entertaining. I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:08.760]   but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:13.560]   will blow your mind and it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.400]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.040]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.000]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.760]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.400]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.600]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify,
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.240]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
