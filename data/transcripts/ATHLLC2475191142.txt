[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.480]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.000]   hacks.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.200]   And today we're talking jobs, careers, and everything in between with Katherine
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.640]   Minshew, founder and CEO of The Muse, a career platform that serves over 7
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.040]   million people each month, and the co-author of the bestselling book, The
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.200]   New Rules of Work, the modern playbook for navigating your career.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.480]   I am so excited to chat with her about finding and getting the right job, making
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.920]   networking suck a whole lot less, and how to build your personal brand online
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.960]   without needing to become a social media influencer.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.560]   But before we jump in, I want to share two quick things.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.280]   First, I would love your support in nominating All The Hacks for a Plutus
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   award for the best new personal finance podcast.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.280]   It will only take a couple seconds, and you can do it by going to
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.680]   allthehacks.com/vote.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.880]   Second, I'm going to be doing a listener mailbag episode soon.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.000]   So if you have any questions for me, or you have any hacks to share with the
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.640]   thousands of All The Hacks listeners, please send an email to
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.840]   chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   All right, let's get to the interview.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.080]   Katherine, thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.480]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.800]   I'm really excited to join.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.840]   We actually have had a bunch of people write in asking if we could do an episode
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.080]   on career, work, jobs, everything.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   So I'm really excited to do this.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.680]   And I want to kick it off with just a random question, which is, what do you
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.800]   think is the biggest misconception when it comes to navigating the modern
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.520]   workplace?
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.960]   Oh, the biggest misconception.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.800]   I think a lot of people are so fixated on how do I get the job?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.480]   How do I convince the company to choose me that they forget to ask themselves,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.600]   what do I want?
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.200]   And what type of company should I be picking?
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.240]   Because a job is not one size fits all, right?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.800]   It is incredibly dependent, not only on your skills, strengths, experiences, but
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.760]   also your preferences, your needs, your values, and how those align with the
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.640]   kind of preferences, needs, values of the team that you work with, the
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.000]   organization that you work for.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.360]   And I think sometimes, especially early career professionals, but I see this at
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.640]   any age, people are so focused on getting picked, getting chosen, getting through
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.280]   the interview, but they forget to really turn the question around.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.480]   And how do you think people should figure that out?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.640]   Like if you are not happy in your current job, and you're not sure what you want to
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.600]   do next, obviously you could just start applying to random jobs.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.680]   But is there a process or some advice you give people that are unsure what they
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.200]   should do?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.240]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.560]   And in fact, I don't recommend starting with applying to random jobs, because I
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.960]   think that there's a step before that, a phase zero that sets you off on the right
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.280]   foot.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   And that is a process of self-discovery and self-exploration.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.520]   Now, before, you know, someone listening freaks out, it doesn't have to be weeks or
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   months long.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.320]   You could do it in a focused afternoon, although I do recommend taking a week or
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.520]   two if you have the time.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.880]   And essentially, it's a process of looking at where you are, the experiences that
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.320]   you've had in the past, and trying to ascertain when have you been in flow state,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.080]   which is, you know, as probably everyone listening knows, when just time seems to
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.360]   fly by and you're totally locked in, you can start to think about when have you been
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.160]   happiest in your career?
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   When have you felt most motivated and most engaged and productive at work?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.440]   If you have the time, I really recommend asking friends, family, perhaps former
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.320]   colleagues who you don't worry might be might be tipped off to the fact that
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.360]   you're thinking about a change.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.920]   But asking them, you know, what do you see as my strengths?
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.200]   When do you see me light up professionally?
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.880]   And I think once you start to zero in on a couple of your values,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.240]   professionally, it can be much easier and more straightforward to organize a job
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.560]   search.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.160]   And these aren't these values aren't the same for everyone, right?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.400]   So you might realize that you really value a stable work environment, or someone
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.600]   might want quite the opposite.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.400]   They might want a work environment where things are constantly changing, and
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.720]   there's experimentation and things are very new and fresh.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.160]   Some people might really value prestige or compensation.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.080]   Other people might want maximum flexibility, or creativity, or they may
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.200]   want to be deeply aligned with the mission of the organization that they
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.760]   work for.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.440]   There are a lot of different things you can prioritize in your career, but
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.080]   you're not necessarily going to find a job or a company that is 10 out of 10 on
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   every dimension in the world.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.440]   But you can find one that's 10 out of 10 on the you know, three to four values or
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.840]   dimensions that matter most to you.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.200]   So I think that's the most powerful place to start.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.000]   Even though sometimes people can get impatient, they just want to dive in and
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.600]   jump in.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.800]   Yeah, I've been in this situation before.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.320]   And if you get laid off, obviously, there's a different sense of urgency to
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.960]   what happens.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   But I noticed you didn't say, you know, pursue your passion, which is something I
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.320]   hear a lot of people often say when you're looking for what to do.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.680]   How do you feel about that phrase?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.200]   I just don't find it very helpful as a phrase, right?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.320]   First of all, like, what is my passion?
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.400]   A lot of people don't know, and labeling something a passion can make the stakes
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.080]   feel incredibly high.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.880]   Secondly, a lot of people are actually happier serving their passion if it is
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.480]   outside of work, but they pick a professional set of pursuits that
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.160]   complement it.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.280]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.960]   You might love to paint, but do you want to be a professional painter?
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.440]   Maybe.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.680]   And if you do, absolutely, like, go live your dreams.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.960]   But for a lot of people that have a passion for painting or a passion for some
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.680]   sort of perhaps artistic endeavor, they are actually happier not putting all of
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.320]   the pressures of financially supporting themselves on that passion.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.480]   They're happier thinking about a career that is motivating, that is exciting, but
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.080]   perhaps provides the financial stability or the flexibility.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.280]   Again, I think live your passion is, you know, it's a fun phrase.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.800]   It's a great catchphrase, but I just think it's a little bit overused because, you
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.040]   know, it doesn't necessarily provide signpost.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.480]   Now, for some people, they're deeply passionate about making some sort of
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.520]   change in the world or a specific mission.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.640]   And if you can align your career with the larger good you want to see in the
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.120]   world, that's incredibly motivating.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.000]   And I think it's something that, again, if that matters to you deeply, you should
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.440]   absolutely strive to do.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.800]   But I wouldn't necessarily say that always fits in the catchphrase of, like,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.040]   follow your passion.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.480]   I think that sometimes it's helpful to just take a step back and and really think,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.960]   you know, what what am I good at?
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.560]   What can I make a living at?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.680]   What do I enjoy?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.280]   Where's an intersection between those?
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.720]   And again, if you have a passion, an artistic pursuit, a hobby, et cetera, I
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.320]   think it's really important and fair to say, do I want this to be my livelihood or
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.800]   do I want this to be a beautiful and important part of a larger life that
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000]   includes a different professional component?
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.080]   And I think that both of those are really valid.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.680]   And again, I just really encourage people to ask themselves the question and honor
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.360]   whatever answer comes up for them, not what answer you think culturally you should
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.840]   choose or what your friends say or what some influencer on Instagram told you to
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.480]   do. It's really like, what is the right answer for you specifically?
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.800]   Because each of us has such a different set of needs as well as hopes and dreams in
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.400]   our careers.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.560]   Yeah, my brother in law loves golf and used to be a professional golfer briefly and
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.480]   realized that that changes the whole thing.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.120]   When this thing that you loved doing as a hobby, as a way to spend time, as a way to
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.720]   enjoy time with friends becomes your job, he started not loving golf as much as he
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.280]   had before and immediately was like, I need to find something else.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.680]   And now he runs North American sales at AppDynamics and it's a totally different
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.240]   career and is so happy that he's not a professional golfer but still golfs all the
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.680]   time. So I'm a big fan.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.240]   You know, my day job is not pursuing all the hacks.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.120]   It just happens to be what I do on my free time.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   So it doesn't have to be the same thing.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.280]   I totally agree.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.720]   If we go back in time for you, how does what you're doing now line up with your
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.600]   passion? How did you end up finding an entire career in this career?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:12.800]   Yeah, so I do feel like I pursued my own winding, eclectic career path by following a
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.920]   lot of the principles that are now part of what I talk about via the Muse and via my
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.360]   book. So for me, when I started and actually I'll go back like way back to age 13, 14
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   year old Catherine, I fell in love with that television show Alias that starred
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.160]   Jennifer Garner. If you or anybody listening remembers, it was this amazing show about
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.040]   like a double agent. And I decided really early on I was going to be either a CIA
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.600]   agent or an ambassador.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.040]   Like that was the plan.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.200]   That was the goal.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.400]   I did actually briefly think also about pursuing theater professionally.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.720]   Theater was a big extracurricular passion of mine, and I loved it.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.520]   But when I did a few community theater productions or talk to people who were
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.120]   professionals in the field, to your point about your brother, it didn't really feel
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.160]   like doing that professionally was going to be as fulfilling as doing it as a hobby
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.360]   or an activity that I deeply enjoyed.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:15.240]   And so I focused in on like I'm going to be this secret agent or this State Department
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.000]   official. And luckily, in 2007, I applied for and was accepted to work at a U.S.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.840]   embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, in the regional security office.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.760]   And let me tell you, I have some amazing stories from that time.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.320]   It was a totally wild, fascinating experience.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:41.640]   But I very quickly realized that the sort of reality of life in the State Department
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.920]   and in government service in general, it didn't match this idea I had built up in my
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.480]   head, right, about what the career was actually like.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.840]   And so even though I consider that time to be an incredible experience, I also came out
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.720]   of it with all of the angst of a 22-year-old saying, like, what do I want to do with my
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.120]   life if it's not this?
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.240]   And I then spent the next two or three years feeling somewhat lost.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.080]   I worked at McKinsey and Company as a consultant for a few years.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.960]   I moved to Kigali, Rwanda, and ran a vaccine introduction for a period of time, which,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.400]   by the way, fascinating now that vaccines are in the news again.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.440]   But I was really trying these different careers.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.680]   And I was also spending a lot of time on job boards.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.400]   I was on monster.com all the time.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.840]   I was looking on different company career websites, trying to figure out what were the
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.200]   jobs that were even out there.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.840]   What did that actually mean to do those jobs?
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.800]   Would I like that?
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.000]   And I became just personally fascinated by, first of all, how complex the career search
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.440]   is. I became really interested in how to assess what a company's culture and values are
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.880]   from the outside. What is the employee experience like?
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.160]   Because it's very different at very different companies, you know, a sales job or an
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.040]   engineering job or a marketing job.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.840]   It's not a single interchangeable thing where it doesn't matter where you work.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.800]   No, it actually matters very much where you work.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.680]   And so I was really interested in how people make career decisions from the outside.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.800]   And it frustrated me at the same time.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   When I was leaving McKinsey, I was getting recruited by some hedge funds, by big tech
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.480]   companies. And, you know, some of them were rolling out the red carpet with these very
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.400]   expensive recruiting dinners.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.000]   And all of this time they were investing one on one in me, trying to convince me to join
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.320]   their company. And then I would go online and look at other jobs.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.200]   And it was this terrible transactional paper thin experience where they were just like,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.160]   do you have these skills?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.120]   Apply. Maybe we'll consider you.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.600]   Like, it was just terrible.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.640]   And I thought there's got to be something between these two extremes.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.600]   There should be an online platform that helps create a digital red carpet experience that
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.640]   gives someone insight into the culture and values that accompany, you know, and and helps
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.840]   also guide and coach people as they go through the the often fraught and challenging
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.640]   process of finding a job, figuring out what they want to do.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.280]   And so the idea for the Muse was percolating for a long time before I actually started
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.080]   the business. But I really felt like I built it because I needed it and it didn't exist.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.600]   Well, that's amazing. I had like six follow ups that came from that one.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.760]   One was you ended up having to go work at the State Department in order to figure out
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.160]   that you didn't want to do that.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.400]   Knowing everything you know now, do you think there's something you could have done to
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.480]   figure out if that would have been a good fit without having to go do it?
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.080]   You know, I think if I had been able to sit down with people who worked at the State
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.200]   Department, what's called an informational interview, that might have given me the
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.440]   insight that I needed or even watching enough videos of people who were in that career
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.160]   path talking about a typical day in their life, what they did, how it worked.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.200]   That's frankly some of the experience that I've tried to approximate with the Muse,
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:10.480]   because not everyone has the opportunity to go work for an organization and then change
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.840]   their mind or go sit down one on one over coffee with someone who's in a particular
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.280]   career field. Obviously, I got a really deep front row seat to what the organization was
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.240]   like by working there.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.720]   But I absolutely think that had I been a little bit savvier of a job searcher, I might
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:35.120]   have been able to recognize that beforehand without going all the way to Cyprus to find
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.480]   out that it wasn't the end all be all for the rest of my career.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.720]   So that brings up an important part of this entire process that you dedicate, I think,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.880]   an entire chapter to about networking with people.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.240]   I'd love to just dig into how you think people could do a better job.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.800]   I know that it can be daunting for some people, especially going into a new career to
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.280]   find people, both for the purpose of learning, for the purpose of having an in if you find
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.240]   a company you want.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.440]   Are there things you think people should start with to try to build those skills and be
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.560]   productive with networking?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.040]   Yeah. So first of all, I don't know about you, but when I first started thinking about
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.600]   networking, it almost had a bad rap to me, right?
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.800]   I imagine these guys in ill-fitting suits and briefcases, mechanically shaking hands
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.720]   and passing business cards back and forth in like a hotel lobby.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.520]   And I think if you break that apart in your mind and you just say, OK, networking is
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:37.000]   about meeting new people, learning about them, getting to know them and thinking about
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.240]   it as a long game of just investing in those around you.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.400]   It really reframes networking for a lot of people.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.040]   And I think that it also helps you understand what works for you.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.560]   Some people really ace those big, giant networking events like conferences.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.760]   Other people do really well by hosting their own smaller networking events, getting to
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.120]   know people in quieter or more small group settings.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.080]   And I think that's all right.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:08.160]   So when I think about tips for networking, I often encourage people to understand your
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.080]   own preferences, what's going to make you most comfortable.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.160]   Do you want to try going to bigger events?
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.640]   Do you want to invite four people that you know professionally and ask them to each
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.880]   invite two people and host some sort of smaller group?
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.280]   I've had people have great success organizing book clubs around professional
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.760]   related books and using that as a forum to meet people.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.840]   So understand what works for you.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.640]   I think it's also helpful to set a few goals for yourself.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.360]   Is it that you want to attend one networking event a month or reach out to three
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.280]   contacts from your network every week to see how they're doing?
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.800]   Whatever the goals are, sometimes just writing them down can give you a clarity
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.200]   around what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.560]   If you're going to in-person events, I always recommend, you know, dress
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.200]   comfortably.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.760]   You want to focus on the people there, not your shoes or your outfit.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.440]   It can be really great to bring what I term in the book a wingman or a wingwoman,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.600]   which is someone else who's in your same professional space who you feel very
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.160]   comfortable with.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.520]   You enjoy their company so that, you know, you may find that at the event you spend a
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.480]   lot of time apart talking to different people.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.040]   But you also know that if you want a kind of touchstone or you want to just recenter
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.480]   yourself in the middle of event, you can go find them, join the conversation they're
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.840]   having and vice versa.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.400]   I also think that, again, networking doesn't have to be this sort of large kind of
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   faceless thing.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.960]   You can focus at times on just, you know, a smaller number of deeper connections and
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.120]   informational interviews are a really helpful way to do that.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.080]   And, you know, is it helpful if I talk a little bit about informational interviews
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.440]   for people who may not be as as familiar with the best practice there?
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.880]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.360]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.080]   I get it.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.280]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.680]   hang.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.720]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.160]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.200]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.040]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.440]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.920]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.600]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.000]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.520]   yours.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.440]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.680]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.320]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.000]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.680]   it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.600]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.960]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.560]   So what is an informational interview?
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.880]   First of all, it's sitting down, usually one-to-one, across the table or on a Zoom
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.320]   with someone who's in a career field or a role that you're interested in and learning
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.600]   more. What do they do in a typical day?
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.520]   What are the kind of best and worst things about their job?
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:21.360]   It's a really great way of exploring a career field, a company, a particular type of
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.520]   work before you dive in and fully commit.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.080]   Frankly, it's what I wish I had done earlier in my career so that I would have known
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.720]   more about some of these different fields before I dove in.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.160]   So there's a few tips that I find make informational interviews go much better.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.320]   First of all, do your research ahead of time.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.440]   Many informational interviews will start out with either you reaching out cold to
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.560]   someone, perhaps through your network, through your college or university's alumni
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.320]   network. You know, you might be introduced by a mutual friend, but you're reaching out
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.800]   to someone and asking for 15, 30 minutes, maybe an hour of their time to learn more
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.840]   about their career path and guide you on your own.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.880]   And so I think it's really helpful to do a bit of research ahead of time, understand
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.240]   where they've come from, what are some of the key elements of or key turning points
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.480]   in their career so that you're not asking them questions that you could have answered
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.520]   with a Google search, thinking about you making a good impression.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.920]   This is someone who might be able to refer you for a job or an opportunity in the
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.600]   future, someone that you may be able to help.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.440]   So really being prompt, being respectful of their time is very helpful.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.360]   I also love asking what I call dual questions or positive negative questions.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.200]   So sometimes one of the most helpful things you can learn from an informational
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.880]   interview is something like what sort of people would not be happy in a career field
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.120]   like yours or what are some of the challenges of working at, you know, company X, Y, Z.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.160]   But often if you ask a directly negative shaded question like that, sometimes people
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.960]   will be protective of where they work.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.840]   And so they may hesitate to give you an honest answer, which is why I like these dual
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.360]   questions. It's essentially asking a positive and a negative at the same time.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.760]   So this might look like asking someone I'd really love to understand more what it's
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.440]   actually like to work at company X, Y, Z.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.920]   What are some of your favorite things about working there?
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.120]   And what are some of the things that might be more challenging or frustrating for
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.640]   people? Or you could ask, you know, when I'm thinking about whether I want to build a
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.360]   career as a brand marketer or a data engineer or whatever the career field is, what do
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.480]   you think are some of the things that are really most enjoyable and exciting to you
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.560]   about the field? And what are some of the things that are drawbacks or challenges that
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.640]   someone should be aware of?
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.360]   I think if you give people a chance to answer both the good and the bad, you tend to get
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.640]   much more honesty.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.320]   And again, honesty is what you're going for because you are ultimately usually in these
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.520]   conversations trying to get the information that will help you decide if a particular
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.480]   career field or particular company is going to be a good fit.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.960]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's really important to realize that networking doesn't have to
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.640]   just be these big events with lots of people, and there's a lot of value that can come
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   from this one-on-one network.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.560]   I'll share a couple of my tips because I really love the challenge of finding email
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.640]   addresses and finding connections to people.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.320]   I feel like that's just a game that I really enjoy.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.720]   And so when I started thinking about how to do this kind of one-on-one networking, first
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.400]   I would go to LinkedIn and I would look at all my connections and then I would look at
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.040]   all their connections and I would just scroll through.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.520]   And so before I would meet with someone, I would go in with a list and sometimes I even
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.400]   printed it out depending on how well I knew them.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.560]   But I was like, here are the seven people that this person knows that could be a good
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.480]   fit for me to meet.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.360]   And so every time I went to one of those meetings, I would go and know who could I
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.000]   potentially be looking for an introduction for.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.520]   And then I always have an idea of my network.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.400]   So who are you looking to meet and how could I add value back to you?
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.160]   That's when you know the person you're meeting with.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.920]   When you don't, sometimes you need to find an email address.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.000]   And so there are a bunch of browser extensions.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.280]   I use one called Lucia, which basically like when you're on a LinkedIn profile will show
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:02.960]   you an email.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.280]   But the biggest trick I found that, you know, for validating emails is if you just
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.880]   search in Google for an email with quotes, you'll get but if it's not in quotes, it
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.600]   always fails. But if it's in quotes, you usually get back whether that email is out
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.320]   there. And I found emails in the strangest places.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.240]   So you just kind of like guess someone's email address, you know, for you, I would
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.640]   try, you know, first name, last name, first letter, last name, all these different
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.840]   combinations. And I've seen things pop up where there's like a random PTA agenda for
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.120]   some, you know, school, but they're the coordinator.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.880]   And so their email is on this agenda.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.680]   And so when you're trying to find email addresses, there's a lot of ways to be
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.360]   creative. I love that.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.480]   Yeah, I mean, I go a little bit intense sometimes because I want to make these
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.440]   events efficient. So if I go to an event, one thing that I find that most people don't
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.480]   know you can do, you can often email a conference and say, "Hey, do you have a list
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.520]   of the attendees?" You don't need to email.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.720]   Sometimes they just include the email addresses, which is like, you know, someone
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.840]   sent you a plate of gold.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.360]   Sometimes they don't.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.000]   But I go through every conference or every event.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.960]   I try to find all the attendees, figure out who's interesting.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.640]   And sometimes I'll go one step further and I'll go to their LinkedIn profiles.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.240]   I'll copy their photos and I'll put them in a notes doc on my phone.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.560]   So when I'm like, "OK, I'm going to go stand on the wall for a second, look through
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.480]   this and try to identify who are these people I'm trying to meet?" And then I'll be
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.560]   like, "There's Bill." And then I'm like, "I'm like targeting Bill.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.200]   I want to go talk to Bill." And I walk up there.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.800]   I love this so much, by the way, because I think what you just gave is a mini
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.240]   masterclass on how to get the attention of people who are otherwise busy.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.960]   And you're completely right that being in the same place at the same time is one of
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.640]   the best ways. I would say, you know, back when I used to attend a lot more
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.040]   conferences, my schedule was packed.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.120]   But if someone said, "Hey, Catherine, I'm also going to be where you already are.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.880]   Do you have 15 minutes during one of these breaks?" I am probably about 30 times
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:08.360]   more likely to say yes than if it had just been a cold email asking for a phone call
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.400]   or something. Likewise, if you can find any other points of connection with that
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.200]   person through perhaps Googling them, stalking them, it's such a great way to get
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.000]   on someone's radar. And I think that's brilliant.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.320]   Yeah. So sometimes it can backfire.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.120]   So when I was in college, I was applying for a job in New York and I was at home and I
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.880]   grew up like you did in Northern Virginia, right outside D.C.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.280]   And there was a company in New York and I really wanted to work at this company.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.680]   And so I sent an email to the person that I'd been introduced to.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.240]   And I said, "Hey, I'm in New York this week." And it's four hours away.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.160]   I was like, "Would you be up for meeting up?" And I thought, you know, if this person
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.520]   thinks I'm already there and I'm only there this week, there's a higher likelihood
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.120]   that they'd make the effort. And I remember getting an email at like 10 p.m.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.080]   that was like, "Could you come in at 6 tomorrow morning or 7?" It was some really
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.240]   early time. And so I literally took the 1 a.m.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.040]   Amtrak up to New York, got in at like 3.45 in the morning, went to a friend's house
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.400]   and took a shower and got all dressed up.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.600]   Put my suit on and showed up.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.160]   And only about six months later did I actually say, you know, I was actually not in New York
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.440]   at the time. And the person thought it was funny.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.240]   People love the hustle though, right?
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.120]   It really does.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   That's actually how I got the URL, themuse.com.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.960]   The person who owned it was this amazing guy who lived in Washington, D.C.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.040]   actually. And I at the time was in San Francisco, California, because I had just
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.400]   finished the Y Combinator Incubator Program for The Muse.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.040]   And similarly, I actually had gotten his email through some connection.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.960]   I had been emailing him, researching him, trying to get a meeting.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.480]   And finally, I said, "I'll be in D.C. this weekend."
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.040]   And somewhat similarly, he's like, "Great.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.240]   How about Sunday morning at 10 a.m.?"
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.800]   And it was a tight turnaround.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.760]   But I was on, I think, a red eye that Saturday night.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.480]   And I made the meeting and ended up getting the URL and bringing him on as an advisor.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.400]   So sometimes you just have to show up or pretend, in this case, that you are already
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.840]   there.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.960]   I know. Yeah.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.160]   So two things that you mentioned in your book that I thought were really interesting, I
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.040]   want to make sure I highlight.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.160]   One was, in addition to these two-sided questions, when you're networking, you
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.880]   mentioned asking open-ended questions.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.160]   And I think I fail at this a lot.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.400]   But the tip I really love is, instead of saying, "Do you like working at Google?"
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.640]   Where someone can be like, "Yes."
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.680]   And then there's nothing left, you could say, "Well, what's it like to work at
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.840]   Google? What do you think?"
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   And that's a much longer answer.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.240]   And I think my brain, when I'm in work mode, is always in the "Let's be efficient.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.000]   Let's be efficient."
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.360]   But when it comes to building relationships, the goal isn't to get to the end result as
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.200]   fast as possible.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.600]   It's to build the relationship.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.160]   So that's one tip that I really liked.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.880]   And then I'll ask you this one.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.800]   This is where I feel like I fail.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:03.040]   I am terrible at just leaving a conversation in a professional setting where I've been
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.560]   there for...
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.000]   I'm trying to meet 10 people.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.680]   I've only got a couple hours.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   Do you have any tips what to do when you're 15 minutes in?
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.920]   You've made that relationship.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.600]   You've kind of set up maybe a next step and you're trying to get around the room and meet
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.480]   more people.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:21.320]   So first of all, I think it can be helpful to recognize that often the other person is
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.120]   secretly thinking the same thing.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.520]   They're thinking, "I've loved this conversation, but I could really use a refill on my drink."
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.240]   Or, "I'd like to go chat with some others."
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.840]   So first of all, if you are in an in-person setting, I like to purposefully have as much
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.520]   as possible a half-empty drink or a nearly empty food plate so I can use that as an excuse.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.280]   It's a universal human excuse.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.360]   "Oh, Chris, it's been great catching up, but I actually am going to go get a refill, but
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.400]   I'll catch you later."
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.200]   Or, "I think I'm going to go try more of that guacamole."
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:51.600]   I don't know.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.240]   I love food.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.520]   I'm very food-motivated.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.760]   I find that people tend to react really well.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.040]   If there's no food or drinks or you have a full drink, that's not an option.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.760]   I think sometimes you can just be really kind but direct.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.960]   Maybe they've told you about something, let's say a work accomplishment.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.360]   "Wow, that's really incredible.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.560]   You must be really proud."
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.720]   Well, I'd love to hear more about that.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.320]   I actually need to walk around the room quickly and there's a few people I need to catch up
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.760]   with, but let's swap information and maybe we can follow up later on.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:24.000]   Or I think sometimes just saying that, "I've really loved talking to you, but would love
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.120]   to continue this later."
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.000]   And as much as it can be awkward to do, often the other person is grateful.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.240]   And in fact, if I'm speaking with someone who's much more important than me, for example,
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.320]   a speaker at a conference or when I've met various tech celebrities, I always make a
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.400]   point of ending the conversation first because no one ever does it with them.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.920]   And it's such a power move to be talking to Elon Musk and be like, "Well, it was amazing
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.600]   getting to meet you, but I'm going to go grab another drink, but hopefully see you around."
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.920]   I find it's actually, whatever the situation, it can be such a great way of acknowledging
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.000]   the other person's time and the fact that they likely have a long agenda.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.200]   If the conversation is meant to continue, you can find each other later at the event
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.640]   or in a separate follow-on.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.240]   And those follow-ons, I tend to say, try to come up with some next step if you want
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.880]   to meet this person, as opposed to waiting.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.560]   People are always more willing to commit to things in person.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.200]   So if you're trying to get someone to introduce you to someone, a person at their company
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.760]   or a friend of theirs, just ask.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.000]   Because if you wait till you send an email, it's so easy for someone to say no.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.680]   But if you say, "Hey, would you be willing to introduce me to this person?"
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.640]   People are really, really uncomfortable saying no in person.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.920]   So that's also something I always suggest in person.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.320]   Yes.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.400]   And definitely, you just hit on, I think, the importance of following up.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.240]   Saying, you know, the next day, sometimes even that same day.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.600]   Sending a quick email.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.960]   So great to talk to you.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.360]   You know, as we discussed, I love to XYZ.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.560]   Putting it in writing, getting that quick follow-up.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.680]   Often, I find I'll need to send a second note a few days later because many people get backlogged
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.880]   on email right after they speak or when they're at an event.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.440]   That's okay.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.080]   I think it's just helpful to really be fairly quick with that follow-up while things are
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.640]   still fresh.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.520]   And ideally, while they're still feeling the enthusiasm of the human connection of the
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.800]   conversation that you two had.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.440]   So don't follow any dating rules.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.720]   Don't wait seven days.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.960]   Just follow up quick.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.960]   I think that, you know, there are many parallels between dating and professional connections.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.640]   But I absolutely think that this is not one you don't want to play too hard to get, especially
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.400]   if you're in the position of looking to build your network, looking to meet new people.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.720]   You know, people often respond very favorably to the kind of clearly expressed intention
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.960]   that you admire their career or you'd like to get to know them better or learn from them
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.840]   or something like that.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.840]   So it's not a time to beat around the bush.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.760]   Yeah, totally.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.800]   So I want to...
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.160]   Before we jump into actually finding opportunities that could be interesting, there's a part
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.120]   of the book that talks about building your personal brand.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.600]   And when I hear someone talk about building their personal brand, my immediate reaction
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.560]   is, "Oh, I've got to go become a YouTube influencer and I have to start creating video
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.640]   content every day and posting on social media."
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.800]   Is it really about all of that?
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.560]   Or does it have to be about all that?
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.280]   No, it does not.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   But I love that because you're exactly right.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:32.800]   That many people have this idea that having a personal brand is synonymous with being
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.760]   an influencer or spending hours every week crafting an online persona.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.480]   The fact is, you have a personal brand, whether you've thought about it or not.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.440]   Everyone does.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.000]   Your personal brand is how people talk about you when you're not in the room.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.600]   And it's sometimes uncomfortable to think about that.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.880]   But every single one of us is referred to or discussed in various casual ways by colleagues,
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.280]   by bosses, by others when we're not there.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.920]   And so I like to think about it, first of all, as this question, "What do you want to
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.560]   be known for?"
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:13.360]   So what are the attributes, the adjectives, and the accomplishments that you want people
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.200]   to think of when they say your name?
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.760]   And if you want to think about building a personal brand, again, this doesn't have to
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.720]   be an arduous process, but I think it is really, really important in today's world because
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:30.480]   of how interconnected we are on social media, because of the way that your reputation is
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.040]   going to precede you in so many different aspects of your professional career and, frankly,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.480]   your personal life as well.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.520]   And so, again, just like I talked about, the beginning of a job search is often that period
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.000]   of self-reflection or self-discovery.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.720]   I think that a good personal brand exploration starts the same way.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.360]   Just thinking, "What do I want to be known for?"
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.640]   If you have the time, I love to recommend that you ask colleagues, bosses, friends,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.920]   "What do you think I'm known for?
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.400]   What do you think are some of the adjectives people would use to describe me?
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   What are some of my strengths?"
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   And then, ideally, think about a few key words or phrases that are really important.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   Maybe it's around your creativity.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.200]   Maybe it's your consistency and dependability.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.120]   Maybe it's your financial acumen, your facility with numbers.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.160]   Whatever it is, just getting really clear about how you want to be known is step one.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.720]   And then thinking about how you consistently communicate that.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.160]   You know, a very baseline place is your social profiles, your LinkedIn, your Twitter, your
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.440]   Instagram, if you have them.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.600]   I think it's important also to know that you should have some consistency, but that doesn't
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.880]   mean sameness.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.360]   So, every profile shouldn't look exactly the same because, you know, because they're not
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.720]   the same platforms, right?
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.520]   If I showed up exactly the same way on Instagram that I do on LinkedIn, one of those would
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.040]   be a really awkward fit.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.240]   But I should clearly seem like the same person with some of the same key values.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.920]   So, whether that's authenticity, you know, my interest in the future of work and talent,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.960]   just really being deliberate and specific, making sure that you have a reasonably good
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.880]   photo of yourself on each platform.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.480]   I think that can be very helpful.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.240]   And then I would really recommend that people consider a personal website.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   Now, of course, it depends on what you do.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.200]   It's not as relevant for every career field, but really, you can think of it as a piece
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   of real estate on the internet where you can say exactly what you want about who you are
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.320]   and what you're good at.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.840]   Just gives you a little bit more space to talk about key accomplishments, share examples
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:40.240]   of your work if it's digitally available, perhaps include video clips or, again, just
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.800]   a bit of additional text and give people a way to get in contact with you that is not
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.320]   just a Twitter DM or LinkedIn in-mail.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.840]   So, we have a lot of tips on The Muse for specifically how to think about building a
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.800]   personal website.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.480]   But I think that they can be really, really powerful and they're often underused.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.240]   And also, again, if you're reaching out to industry influencers or others to set up networking
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.560]   events, informational interviews, being able to link to a few key places online that very
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.440]   clearly and concisely give a sense of, again, who you are, what you stand for, what you're
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.800]   known for is really important if you want people to respond to your email.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.600]   So, is it your LinkedIn profile that is that kind of key best thing?
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.880]   Is it a personal website?
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.200]   Maybe if you're creative, it's your TikTok.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:31.440]   Whatever it is, just really know that you're crafting it so that someone gets as accurate
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.600]   an impression of you as possible in a fairly short amount of time.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.800]   And know that people are going to be Googling you all the time for professional opportunities,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.160]   for personal opportunities.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.120]   So the more, again, that you can be intentional about how you show up online, the better.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.680]   I think sometimes people think they have to go write blog posts and create content to
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.560]   manage their brand.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:58.000]   But for the longest time, I had my name.com and it was literally just a website that had
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.440]   some social links and three sentences about me in a photo.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.000]   And the crazy thing was, if you search for my name now, that's one of the things that
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.400]   pops up.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.800]   It's this website that didn't have a lot of information on it, but just gave people a
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.080]   very easy way to find you and links and your email address and that kind of stuff.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.760]   Which comes up with another question.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.920]   Maybe 20 years ago, it wouldn't have been a thing.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   But nowadays, I think with so many social platforms and employers Googling employees,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.600]   is it now okay to have pictures of yourself just having a good time on the internet?
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.920]   And are all employers okay with that?
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.320]   Or are certain industries a little turned off by that?
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.640]   Or what's the latest policy on what you post on Instagram or Twitter?
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:46.400]   So I love that you asked this because it is a constantly changing answer.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:53.680]   As society adapts to the proliferation of images and video and information on social,
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.120]   I would say, first of all, that most employers recognize that you and me, we're humans.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.640]   We have fun.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.920]   We see friends.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.720]   We socialize.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.240]   We might drink an alcoholic beverage.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.880]   So I think it's important to use your judgment for the majority of industries and the majority
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.680]   of employers.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.160]   Casual photos of someone drinking or having fun on a social platform are not going to
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.200]   be a problem at all.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.680]   That said, there's a few exceptions.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   And certain industries are more strict.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.200]   And I can talk about that in a second.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:30.240]   But if you had a photo of yourself doing a keg stand or some sort of extreme drinking
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.160]   event, I'd probably recommend, if you're thinking about changing jobs, that you consider
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.400]   taking it down or at least removing your name.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:42.000]   If you have some very incendiary or controversial political views, that can be another thing
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.920]   that can hamper you in a job search.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.880]   Now, some people decide, "This is me, and I don't want to be hired by someone who has
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.200]   a problem with anything I say or do online."
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.280]   And that is an acceptable approach.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.600]   But if you don't feel that way, if you want to think about this as, "That's my personal
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.680]   life, but I don't want it to interfere with my job," then I often recommend do a Google
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.760]   search on yourself, look at your social profiles, and just think about, "Are there things that
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   might really surprise someone?"
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:15.600]   Now, a few industries -- financial services can be a bit more particular when it comes
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.120]   to social events on social media.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.160]   Things like client service or therapists, where it's one-on-one.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.400]   Again, it's very complicated because you still have, in some cases, a generation that didn't
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.320]   grow up with their lives online, judging a generation that did.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:37.360]   So that adds some complexity because it's very easy to throw stones about social media
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.280]   if, you know, Facebook and Instagram didn't come around until you were in your mid-to-late
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.080]   30s.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.520]   But at the same time, I think, by and large, hiring managers are much more relaxed about
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.960]   this type of thing than they were in the past, and they're not going to begrudge someone
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.400]   who's, you know, having a good time, enjoying themselves, unless it sort of crosses a line
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:03.520]   that I would say is, again, you know, pretty extreme drinking, very controversial statements.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:09.200]   That is probably where I would suggest, like, just unless you really feel committed to it,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.160]   just take your name off it, you know, make it a little bit less.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.840]   Because job searching is already hard enough, and do you really want to worry, "Did I not
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.280]   get that interview because of how I answered that second question or because they saw this
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.120]   diatribe that I went on?"
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.920]   And again, I find that, personally, I like to keep the focus on my professional skills
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.280]   and abilities and not so much on things that might be controversial.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.120]   - Totally agree.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.240]   One tip is, if you're trying to Google yourself, make sure you do it from an incognito window,
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.160]   because sometimes you'll search and the results will be different than if someone else was.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.040]   - Yes, that is an important one, by the way.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.320]   And I tend to say, you know, go two to three pages, potentially, into your results.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.160]   You don't necessarily need to go 10, but if somebody is 10 pages deep on your results,
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.400]   they're really doing a forensic audit.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.240]   You can if you're concerned about what's there.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.760]   But most employers are looking at the first page of Google, maybe the first two, very
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.720]   rarely the third.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.160]   It's unusual, in my experience, that someone will go any deeper than that.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.920]   - So that's a lot about how you can prepare before you're kind of ready for this.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.000]   This is stuff you can do when you're not even looking for a job, when you have more free
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.680]   time, but if you start thinking about what you want to do next, and you have a few ideas,
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:30.320]   what do you think is the right approach today in this kind of modern workplace to find opportunities?
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:36.800]   - I like to recommend a three-pronged approach, because I think it's helpful to have a few
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.240]   different irons in the fire when you're thinking about changing a job.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.800]   So first and foremost, I do think the use of specialized job sites.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.320]   Obviously, I run one, themuse.com, so I'm not unbiased here.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   But focused sites like Themuse that give you access to a really diverse set of offerings
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.760]   that let you see jobs.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.440]   On our site, for example, you can search for jobs by, do they have maternity or paternity
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:03.760]   leave?
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.360]   Do they offer tuition reimbursement?
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:11.120]   It's a good way to get a broad sense of a lot of opportunities in the market, including
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.560]   things that you may not have heard of.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.280]   So I think that's one step, and we can talk more about that.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.720]   Second is specific company websites and social media.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.240]   So are there places that are already on your radar as companies you might want to work
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:24.880]   for?
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.320]   Follow them on social.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.640]   Look to see if they have job-search-specific social channels.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.240]   For example, I think NPR has @NPRjobs on Twitter, just about working at NPR.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.080]   A lot of companies have focused social media handles just on both their employee experience
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.600]   and the roles that they're hiring for.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.000]   Looking on the company websites and understanding, is there a talent pool to sign up for?
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.520]   Because some companies actually end up searching internal talent pools or lists of people who
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.600]   have expressed interest in working at that company before they post roles externally.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.760]   So having a short list of companies that you're interested in, getting on their radar, definitely
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.320]   helpful.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.160]   And then finally, your network.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.120]   And we talked about this from the perspective of building your network, the perspective
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.200]   of having informational interviews.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.840]   But it's very helpful, regardless of where you are in your career, to tap your network
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.520]   for potential job opportunities.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.160]   One thing I like to do is a group email.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.840]   Because I think that an individual email, one-on-one, can be great for people you know
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   really well, but for people who you're less close to, sometimes people don't know how
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.560]   to handle it if they don't personally feel comfortable or know you well enough to help.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.960]   So I like sometimes sending a BCC email to a small group of people that says, "Friends,
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.640]   if you're on this list, it's because I really value your professional opinion.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.800]   And I wanted to enlist your help in my upcoming job search."
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:54.720]   This is a really great opportunity to be very clear about that personal brand, those personal
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.600]   brand attributes and adjectives that we talked about before.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.960]   So you want to concisely explain what it is that you're very good at, what it is that
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.200]   you're looking for, and how your network can help.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   So, you know, "I am a healthcare administrator with X years of experience.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.720]   I focus on this.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.360]   My peers and previous managers would say that I excel at this."
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:20.960]   That, by the way, is one of my favorite tips in interviewing as well as in outreach emails
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.920]   is, and again, it has to be honest because many of these people may know or talk to your
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.800]   peers and former managers, and you don't want to be caught in any sort of falsehood.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.880]   But for things that are true, for things that you hear often, rather than saying, you know,
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.240]   "I am great at this.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.720]   People think I am this," being able to say, "Colleagues and managers frequently describe
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.800]   me as X, Y, Z."
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.560]   Listing out some of those adjectives or talking about some of your accomplishments that others
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.000]   would verify is helpful.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.360]   And then I would say, "Give your network specific ways that they can help."
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.200]   I like to keep the body of the email short and sweet and say, you know, "Read on below
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.600]   my signature for a list of example companies I'm interested in and more details."
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.320]   But really, you can, you know, this is an opportunity to ask for introductions at specific
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.320]   dream employers, list out some of the types of jobs you're looking for.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.080]   And this can be a really, really effective tool if used well.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:19.120]   But I would say, generally, you want to send maybe one of these per person, per job search.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.880]   So it can be less useful if you're following up with people again and again and again.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.520]   "Hey, help me."
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.040]   Because you never want your network to feel like you're pushing the responsibility of
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.400]   you getting a job on them.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.160]   - Yeah.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.800]   And I found when you're sending these emails, sometimes I'll go as far as to say, "Hey,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.880]   if you want to introduce me to someone, here is a blurb of text at the bottom of the email
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.440]   that says, 'Hey, I want to introduce you to Chris.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.640]   He's looking for this.'
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.880]   You know, here's a little blurb of his background."
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.680]   Try to make it as easy as possible for the person that wants to help because they're
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.200]   already going to be doing work for you.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.840]   And if you can make it less work, they're just more likely to help.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.720]   - Yes.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.240]   I completely agree.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.120]   I love that.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.880]   When people reach out to me and say, "Kathryn, I'm looking for X, you know, who can you introduce
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.680]   me to?"
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.280]   That's sometimes a much harder question to answer than when someone's like, "Kathryn,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.560]   I'm looking for this.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.120]   I noticed in your network, you're connected to these seven people.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.600]   Who are you comfortable passing me on?
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.200]   Can I write a blurb for you to use?"
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.440]   You know, just make it as easy for them as possible because most of the people you're
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.040]   asking are really busy.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.120]   Generally, you know, we have hundreds of undone tasks on our to-do list.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.120]   And so, the more that you help someone help you, the more likely they are to do it.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.480]   - Yeah.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.360]   - I just want to thank you, Kwik, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.160]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:45.360]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you can go to
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.240]   allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.120]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.600]   - And sometimes, if I didn't want to bother people in my network for something or I found
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.680]   that I'm making too many requests, I'll just find the email address of the person I'm trying
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.960]   to be introduced to.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.360]   And I won't say that this person has endorsed this introduction, but I'll mention in the
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.320]   email, I'm like, "Hey, looks like we're both connected to Catherine.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.440]   That's great."
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.520]   It's better than a cold email, but not as good as a warm intro, but it's somewhere in
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.000]   the middle.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.520]   So, you can do that even if someone doesn't have the time to help out.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.080]   - Yes.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:24.320]   And again, you brought up a really great point, which is people are more likely to answer
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:29.440]   you or to help you if you have common points of interest or people in common.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.840]   So, whether it's someone you both know, a school you both went to, even an interest
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.560]   you both had.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.440]   When I was telling the story earlier about how I got the Muse.com URL, one of the things
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.160]   I did when I was researching the gentleman who had it is realized that he had worked
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.240]   in global health in Newfoundland and I had worked in global health in East Africa.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.080]   And there were some interesting parallels between this past experience he had, this
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.600]   past experience I had.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.320]   And so, given that I didn't have any connections to him, when I reached out, I was able to
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:06.000]   write my email in a way that highlighted some of the shared things that we seemed to care
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.360]   about from our online profile.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.480]   So, like you said, it's less good than a warm intro from someone who knows and loves and
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.520]   respects you both, but much better than a cold email.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:20.480]   I mean, I get at least 10 emails a week, "Hi, Catherine, can I pick your brain?"
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.800]   But, you know, they're all fighting with each other for a very limited amount of brain space.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:30.320]   And the ones that have warm connections or shared points of interest or experience are
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.600]   much more likely to get answered.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.480]   And if we go through the arc of this process, you've figured out how to get in touch with
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.280]   people, you've started to figure out what you care about, maybe you've identified a
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.240]   few companies.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.720]   Obviously, if there is a job posting that you're qualified for and that you're excited
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.600]   about, you know, you could apply online.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:51.840]   I would treat that personally as the last resort to being able to find someone at the
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.120]   company that could refer you.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.160]   What about when there's not a job posted?
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.000]   If you found a company and you're like, "I'm very excited to work here," but there's not
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.680]   something on their careers page or listed anywhere, what do you tell people to do?
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.080]   That happens frequently, by the way.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:11.200]   Most companies, especially small companies, want to hear from you directly.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.800]   Larger companies, it can be a bit more complicated because they often are so deluged by applicants
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.120]   that they set up guardrails and blockages.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.640]   But I would say, first of all, look to see, again, like we were saying, do you have anyone
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.280]   in your network who works at this company or is connected to someone who works at this
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.000]   company?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.960]   Can you get connected to someone who you can say, "I'm really interested in what your
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.080]   company does.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.400]   I'm excited about working for you.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.840]   Are there opportunities?
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.960]   Here's what I'm good at."
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.800]   For larger companies, they sometimes have what's called a talent network, which I mentioned
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:52.160]   earlier, where you can send in a general application, which essentially describes who you are, what
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.200]   you're good at, what you're sort of known for and your skills are, and then stays in
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.000]   their database.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.040]   But I find that if you can go in through someone directly, that's always the best move.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.000]   But actually, I would say, and this sort of, maybe push back a little bit on the point
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.920]   you said before, I think sometimes doing more than one thing is best.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.120]   So even if you know someone, I would often tell people apply to the talent network as
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:17.840]   well.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.840]   Because worst case, you're just duplicating your efforts.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.120]   Best case, it's another way in, another point of contact.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:31.200]   Similarly, when you think about online job sites, they get a bad rap because Indeed is
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.320]   the biggest one, right?
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.840]   Our data right now from a bunch of our customers shows that on average, employers are making
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.920]   about one hire for every 600 applicants from Indeed.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.200]   So no wonder it feels like it's just going into a black hole.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:52.320]   But for a lot of focus sites like the Muse, the ratio is like 1 to 100 or 1 to 200.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.160]   It still means there's a lot of competition.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.600]   It's still best if you have a human intro or a connection.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:03.520]   But even if somebody reaches out to me through a referral, "Oh, Chris is great at this.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.480]   You guys should talk to him for that role you're hiring for."
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:12.320]   I often will still ask the person to apply as well through our online postings so that
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.680]   they're in our systems.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.360]   And I think I often say like you can't go wrong by doing a mix of both, sometimes at
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.240]   the same company.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:26.640]   Because I think the latest statistics I've heard are that 56% of all jobs are filled
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.720]   today through online job postings.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.920]   So while I would always recommend that people do their best to find the connection, do the
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.040]   informational interview, network your way in, it is certainly a higher likelihood way
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:39.920]   of success.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.880]   There are a lot of jobs that get filled from online pools.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:47.120]   And so I think it's helpful to think about both because particularly for people that
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.960]   don't have a strong of a network, I think that you can sometimes people despair.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.240]   They're like, "I'll never get the job if I don't have a connection."
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.920]   And that's actually not true.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.120]   Again, if you have an opportunity to make a connection, do it.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.720]   And when you get further along in your career, the closer you are to an executive or a senior
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.440]   role, the more important connections become.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:13.840]   The earlier you are in your career, the more jobs tend to get filled through online portals,
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.760]   company websites, etc., partially because of just the volume of roles being hired.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.480]   But I think that being really thoughtful about multiple channels is helpful.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.240]   And again, you will ultimately, if you especially are excited about particular opportunities,
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.920]   you want to maximize your chance of success.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.960]   And if there's no job posting, I wouldn't be afraid to just reach out.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.640]   I know there was a company I really wanted to work at at one point called Simple Geo,
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.160]   and there was no job opening.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.800]   And I just decided that this is the company I want to work at.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.200]   And instead of applying to 20 jobs, I overcommitted to this.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.680]   And I emailed everyone I knew that knew the company.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.520]   Finally, someone said they forwarded an email to one of the founders.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.080]   And I said, "Hey, I really want to work at your company.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.200]   Here's what I do.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.880]   Can I give you a presentation on why you should consider talking to me?"
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.400]   And they gave me 15 minutes.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.080]   And I gave a presentation to one of the founders of the company
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.680]   and convinced them that they should consider hiring me.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   They ended up hiring me to do a freelance project that eventually became a job.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.680]   But I think people maybe don't always realize
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.840]   how valuable passion for the company is as an attribute of a candidate.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.120]   And when I'm looking to hire people at Wealthfront,
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.760]   when I see people email me and I can just tell that they're excited about the product,
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.800]   they're excited about working here, they've done their homework,
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.360]   it bubbles them up to the top of the list.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.320]   Not that I would hire them over a more qualified candidate,
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.240]   but I would definitely want to talk to them knowing that they're so excited.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.880]   And sometimes that happens for roles that we know we're going to hire for in the future,
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.320]   but we don't have listed.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.200]   So if you're really, really excited about a company,
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.240]   I wouldn't let the fact that there's not an opening now
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.840]   dissuade you from reaching out and applying for a job that doesn't exist.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.720]   - Yes.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.400]   Because I think that, again, when you're in the job search seat,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.720]   you can be really fixated on like,
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.280]   "How am I going to convince the right company to hire me?"
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.800]   But it's helpful to remember that companies are sitting there thinking,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.040]   "Wow, how are we going to get the right people for all this work that we have to do?"
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.320]   And if you can show up to a company and demonstrate
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.640]   that you might be the right person and that you have that passion and that commitment,
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.280]   as you said, they're, in some cases, very incentivized to create a role for you,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.760]   to accelerate a role that maybe they've been planning to hire for in two or three months,
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.080]   but suddenly a great candidate shows up.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.800]   You know, who wouldn't want to just fill the role if they have the budget now to do so?
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.840]   So I couldn't agree more.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.520]   And actually, I was trying to flip through the pages of my book
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.360]   to find this specific email that I got early on in the muse.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.480]   I had been thinking about hiring someone in marketing.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.640]   I'd actually been talking to a woman that I thought was interesting.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.240]   And right when it started to fall through and it seemed like maybe
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.320]   she wasn't actually going to be the right fit,
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.240]   I got a cold email from someone who had seen me speak at a conference
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.960]   and essentially said, "I love your company.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.200]   I believe in the mission. I want to be part of it."
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.800]   Exactly like you said, "Here's who I am. Here's what I'm good at.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.440]   You know, if you ever need help, if you ever need consulting,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.600]   if I can ever be of assistance, if there's ever a role, I am on board.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.720]   I want this."
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.880]   And I responded, you know, a day or so later.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.360]   And I was like, "Actually, I'm thinking about hiring a marketer."
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.720]   And that guy, Elliot, worked for the muse for years after that.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.360]   And it was such a core part of our early growth.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.040]   And it's all because, like you said, we didn't have a role posted, but he reached out.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.960]   Yeah. I've hired multiple people for that.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.600]   I've done that myself. Big fan of that approach.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.600]   So you wrote a whole book about this.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.400]   We could spend another hour on interviewing and negotiating.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   So I'll ask a few tactical questions just to kind of fly through things.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.560]   Is there an interview question you think even the most senior candidates always get wrong?
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.840]   Well, everybody struggles with, "Tell me about your biggest weakness."
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:10.880]   Because it can be such a hard and vulnerable thing to cop to your true biggest weakness.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.080]   Frankly, some people don't know it.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.080]   And I would say that's the biggest problem,
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.520]   is when people are not self-aware enough to know their biggest weakness.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.320]   I think it is important to be honest, because good interviewers are looking for self-awareness.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.640]   At the same time, recognize that if your biggest weakness overlaps with one of the
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:31.280]   most important criteria for doing this job well, you will probably not get the job.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.840]   But frankly, you probably shouldn't get that job.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.120]   So I think that there's a way to answer that question
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.800]   that can focus on an area that's a known weakness,
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.240]   what you've done to mitigate it, why you're committed to improving it,
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:49.280]   and ideally have it be something that's a true weakness that is not a core need for the role
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.960]   you're interviewing for, because that can make it very, very hard for an interviewer
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.800]   to feel comfortable giving you the job.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   I've been surprised how often candidates, even senior candidates,
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.760]   will not do a good job of answering, "Why do you want to work here?"
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.840]   or "What attracted you to this company?"
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:11.040]   If the answer feels trite, if it feels very surface level,
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.840]   it's so much less compelling than someone who is immediately clear
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.840]   why this company is so exciting for them.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.160]   It's kind of like we were joking before about areas where job search is not similar to dating.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.760]   This is one where it is very similar.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   People don't want to date someone who just wants a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.120]   That's not very appealing.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.240]   You want someone who's specifically interested in you.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.440]   And for many interviewers, it's exactly the same.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.480]   They want the candidate to have done deep research
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:45.680]   and to really clearly be able to articulate why this company, why this role.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.720]   So that's another one.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.600]   I mean, honestly, interviewing is tricky.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.240]   It's one of the things we have, I would guess,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.720]   probably 3,000 interviewing articles on themuse.com.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.160]   But partially, we've got articles for different functional areas,
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.320]   different types of questions, different seniorities.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.120]   It is a challenge.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.760]   And I think, you know, I do recommend people practice a bit
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.040]   if you haven't interviewed in a while just to get some of the kinks out.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.720]   But at the same time, the interviewer generally wants to find someone great.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.320]   They want you to do well.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.720]   So I think that's an important thing to keep in mind.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.160]   Yeah, we will link to some of these articles in the show notes for people looking for them.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.480]   Okay, few last quick things.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.240]   When people find that job,
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   do you think negotiating is something that people should be doing more of?
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.200]   Yes, I do.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:35.520]   Although, I think you can take cues from the employer
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.920]   on which of the many different areas to negotiate are best.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:46.240]   So first of all, most of the time, when an employer gives an initial offer, it is negotiable.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   Unless they very explicitly say that this is, for example,
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.520]   the same offer we give every single person in this role.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:59.120]   Or if you're being hired for a role that's one of a number of identical things,
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.920]   be it customer service reps, consultants at a large consulting firm, etc.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.520]   Sometimes there's low flexibility.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.600]   But for most companies, most roles,
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.040]   imagine there is at least 5% to 10% flexibility in the first salary number that you're offered.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.480]   And I think it generally doesn't hurt to say, first of all,
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.920]   thank you so much for the offer.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.960]   I'm very excited about the company, but I just need to
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.200]   take a day or two to consider a few things.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.320]   Can I come back to you?
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.920]   Sometimes that's helpful for people who are not as comfortable negotiating
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.640]   as immediately going into a negotiation.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.560]   And it lets you really sit back and think,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.920]   what do I want to ask for?
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.280]   How do I want to ask for it?
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.800]   And then I often recommend that people lay out a few different things.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.840]   So first of all, what's your desired salary range?
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   You can do some research on various online platforms to understand
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.960]   what other companies might be paying for this role.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.880]   Know that different platforms do have very different ranges.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.600]   We find that when we benchmark that certain platforms are consistently higher
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.520]   than others in terms of their ideal or their target salary ranges.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.600]   So I suggest check out a few.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.160]   But I think it is very common and often expected
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.920]   that you go back to the hiring manager.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.640]   Again, I always recommend that you first start by
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.760]   really reiterating how appreciative or excited you are.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.920]   You want the conversation to feel like
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.240]   you're two future great collaborators
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.120]   working in unison towards the ideal outcome,
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.440]   which is that you join the company and everyone's happy.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.280]   So, you know, thank you so much.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.200]   I really appreciated this.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.160]   I wanted to come back and talk about salary.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.320]   I'd be really excited to accept this role
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.560]   if you could get in the range of X.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.760]   Or based on my research, I've seen benchmarks for this role
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.720]   that are in a range of Y.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.560]   Do you think that's something you can do?
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.640]   The more that you can make it a collaborative process
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.240]   and less like an ultimatum,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.360]   the more likely it is to start the relationship off on the right foot.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.600]   It's also helpful to understand internally,
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.400]   is this a question of, "I would take this role no matter what,
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.080]   and I just want to try and negotiate for a slightly higher base,"
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.320]   which I absolutely would encourage you to do?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.480]   Or is this, "I would only take this role if they can meet certain criteria"?
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.000]   Knowing that internally helps you frame your negotiation
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.880]   and it also minimizes unpleasant surprises
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.600]   if you do end up unintentionally communicating
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.280]   that you absolutely must have a company get to a certain number to say yes
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.960]   and then they don't get there and they're like,
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.120]   "Okay, sorry, we offered the job to someone else,"
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.000]   and you're heartbroken.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.040]   So I think it's important to advocate for yourself
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.080]   but also understand what is the outcome you're looking for.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.480]   It's also important to remember it's not just salary.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.320]   People think negotiation, salary, and yes, that's very important
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.920]   and I would absolutely start there.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   But you can also negotiate other things.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.960]   One executive that I know negotiated a $10,000 conference budget
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.720]   as part of her compensation
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.440]   because the company was unable to go too much higher on her base comp
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.400]   because they didn't want her to be out of range with other execs,
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.720]   but they gave her a $10,000 budget to have travel, hotels, and conference fees,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.240]   which she used to go to incredible conferences all over the world.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.360]   She was also able to, I believe, negotiate student loan payment reimbursement
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.280]   and a number of other bells and whistles that were separate from base comp.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.920]   Companies sometimes are also more willing to give you bonus comp instead of base.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.120]   So if, let's say, you want $20,000 higher,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.200]   they come back that they can't do more than $10,000,
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.840]   it's often acceptable to ask,
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.040]   "Could you add $5,000 to $10,000 to my end of your bonus?"
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.400]   - Or even your signing bonus.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.480]   - Yes, absolutely, that's a great point.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   Signing bonus, relocation bonus.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.960]   Sometimes companies just want to be able to say
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.560]   that everyone in this role is between X and Y thousand dollars of base,
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.160]   but if they really want you,
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.960]   they're motivated to find a way to make things work.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.400]   The one thing I would say that I would also just caution people to avoid
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.880]   is sometimes you can sour an employer if they feel like it's a "and one more thing" situation.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880]   So I think it's helpful if you say,
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.280]   "Hey, I'm really excited about this, but I just need you to get to this number."
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.120]   If they come back and get to that number,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.360]   they're expecting that you're going to say,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.120]   "Ideally, yes."
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.160]   Or maybe you might say, "I ended up going with another opportunity."
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:14.640]   That's fine.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.120]   But I wouldn't, at that point, come back and be like,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.560]   "Thanks for giving me what I asked."
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.840]   "And one more thing."
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.000]   Especially if you do that two or three times,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.200]   that's when I've seen sometimes companies sour on a candidate
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.680]   if they feel like the person is not being straightforward and direct in their negotiating.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.040]   - And I would just double down that if you're negotiating with your future boss,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.760]   that I would just emphasize that point even more.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.680]   Because if you're negotiating with a recruiter,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.360]   you might not engage with them regularly.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.720]   If you're negotiating with your boss,
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.760]   building a relationship that will hopefully last for a while.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.560]   - Yes.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.520]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.440]   I would add plus 100 to that.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.600]   Ideally, this is a long-term relationship
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   where they are going to be a huge advocate and supporter of yours.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.120]   And so, again, making it feel during the negotiation
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.200]   like you're on the same side of the table,
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.840]   trying to mutually get to a great goal
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.600]   is going to be much better for that relationship
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.640]   than setting something up that feels adversarial.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.640]   - Yeah.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.760]   Well, so part three of your book, which we won't get into at all,
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.320]   is all about charting your course through the workplace after you're working there.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.440]   And I had intended to try to get to a bunch of questions
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.720]   about communicating with people, getting raises and promotions.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.800]   But I'll just have to say check out the book or we'll have you back another time.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.760]   But it wouldn't be all the hacks if we didn't end
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.440]   asking for your favorite kind of work-life productivity hacks.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.480]   There are a few in the book, but I'd love to hear what your favorites are.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.280]   - Oh, my goodness.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:44.120]   Well, I'm a huge lover of Pocket to save articles that I want to read later.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.960]   My favorite job search hack,
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.840]   and actually, I would say this can apply to promotions as well,
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.280]   which I know we're not getting into in depth,
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.720]   but I think it can be really useful to print out some job descriptions
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.920]   for a role you'd like to have in one to three years
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.760]   and then use two highlighters,
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.840]   one to highlight the skills you have today
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.160]   and one to highlight the skills or experiences
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.880]   that you'd like to acquire in the next one to three years
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.200]   so that you can be a good fit for those roles.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.520]   It's a great way of being really intentional
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.200]   about where you are in your career,
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.120]   what you have today versus where you want to go.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.640]   And then you can use that to raise your hand at work for opportunities
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.000]   or offer in some cases to take on outside projects
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.640]   that might really well position you for those titles
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.880]   you know you're going to be going after in one to three years.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.240]   So that's a good muse hack.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.280]   - Awesome.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.960]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.080]   This was awesome.

[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.320]   And where can people find you and everything you're working on online?
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.840]   - So the Muse website is just themuse.com.

[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.480]   - Sounds great.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.680]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.160]   - Awesome.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:11.640]   Thank you.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.000]   This was a ton of fun.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.080]   - That was so much fun.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.640]   I hope that even if you're not looking to change jobs right now,
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.080]   you learned something valuable.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.520]   Do you have any suggestions for a guest or a topic in a future show?
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.720]   Please let me know.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.560]   And if you have a minute, I would really appreciate a few seconds of your time
