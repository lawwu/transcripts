[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   (music)
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.560]   It's hard to confirm exact numbers, but by educated guess, I would safely assume that
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   the most asked about chapter in the Bible, in our emails, are questions about Romans 9.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   I know without any exaggeration we have hundreds of questions in the inbox on this one chapter alone.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.560]   And within that chapter, Romans 9.22 is very likely the most asked about text of all the
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.440]   other verses in the chapter.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.920]   I know of at least 65 emails just asking about this single text, a hard text.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.760]   Here's one representative question from a listener named Leslie that captures the heart
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.240]   of dozens of those emails.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.760]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.360]   I could use your help in my struggle with Romans 9.22.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.440]   It seems to me to imply that those who are not elect are not even given a chance to repent
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.820]   since they were born for destruction.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.400]   Is this right?
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.460]   Many people are created with no chance of ever being saved."
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.340]   I'm not surprised that Romans 9 is among the texts that people have the most questions
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.580]   about because my own history bore that out.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.140]   Just recently I've been perusing some of my old journal entries from 1977 to 1979.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.180]   I was in my early 30s, and almost all of my discretionary time was spent studying and
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.180]   writing about Romans 9, especially verses 14 to 23.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.700]   And it may interest our listeners that this text, which is so problematic for most of
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.420]   us, the text which highlights the absolute sovereignty of God over salvation as clearly,
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.100]   as forcefully as any other text in the Bible, this text was the text God used in 1979—I
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.500]   can't even date it—December 14 to move me from being an academic theologian after
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.340]   teaching six years in college to becoming a pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church, where
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.420]   I served for 33 years, and to become a pastor with a longing that God would use me to save
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.100]   lost sinners from the cradle to the grave and to grow a strong church that would send
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.620]   hundreds of people to the unreached peoples of the world in world missions.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.900]   I'm saying, I'm bearing witness that the most controversial chapter in the Bible with
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.220]   regard to the sovereignty of God in saving sinners was the chapter that God used in those
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.980]   years to move me out of an academic dealing with the Word of God into a frontline effort
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.100]   to save lost sinners and strengthen the church and reach the nations.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.180]   That's important.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.500]   And I say it because people think that if you believe in the absolute sovereignty of
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.460]   God over the salvation of sinners, you would be disinclined to be a soul-winning pastor
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.580]   and a missions-driven church.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.180]   That's not true.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.340]   It had the opposite effect on me as it did on William Carey, as it did on John Payton,
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.820]   as it did on Adoniram Judson, and hundreds of other missionaries and pastors who laid
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.380]   down their lives to reach lost people with the gospel.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.580]   There is such a thing as hyper-Calvinism, which is not historic Calvinism.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.940]   It's always been a tiny group who have twisted the Bible by their unbiblical logic to say
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.860]   that the only people you should invite to Christ are those who give evidence of being
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.540]   among God's elect.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.140]   So you don't share the gospel indiscriminately like I do.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.500]   You wait and you look for signs among unbelievers that they might be elect.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.260]   That's absolutely wrong.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.100]   It is not what Romans 9 teaches or implies.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.500]   It's not what any other text in the Bible teaches or implies.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.900]   The lover of God's sovereignty who is saturated with a big biblical view of God's power in
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:36.540]   saving sinners says to every human being, every human being, without exception, words
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.120]   like these, "Listen, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.640]   You who have no money, come buy and eat.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.100]   Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread and labor for that which does
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.680]   not satisfy?
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.620]   Come to the water of life.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.100]   Drink freely.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.860]   Everyone, absolutely everyone who received Jesus Christ as the Son of God, crucified
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.100]   for sinners, risen from the dead, every one of you who puts your trust in him as your
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   only and precious Savior will receive with him everything that God has done through him,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.580]   everything that God is for you in him, you will have it all.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.640]   Nothing good withheld from you.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.840]   If you will have the Lord Jesus Christ, you have everything that he achieved, climaxing
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.660]   in everlasting joy in the presence of God.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.660]   That's what you say.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.760]   That's what you say.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.560]   If people will let you talk, you know, a full minute like that, that's what you say to every
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.620]   single human being.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.340]   Now here are the words from Romans 9 that cause people to stumble.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.540]   Let me say a word about them.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.580]   Romans 18, following.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.460]   So God has mercy on whom he wills and he hardens whom he wills.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.760]   You will say then, why does he still find fault?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.640]   In other words, we're not asking a question Paul didn't ask, right?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.940]   We're not sticking, "Oh, I've got a question, Paul, that you never thought of."
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.460]   No, you don't.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.240]   For who can resist his will?
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.020]   And now Paul did not say, "Well, everybody can resist his will.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.020]   We all have free will.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.160]   Everybody can resist his will."
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.380]   That's not the way he answered the question, "Who can resist his will?"
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.540]   Verse 20, "Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.540]   Now he did not mean by that question, "We should never ask God questions."
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.740]   That's not what he meant.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.940]   He meant, "You should never react with disapproval when he answers."
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:55.000]   And he goes on, "Will what is molded say to its molder, 'Why have you made me like
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.200]   this?
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.380]   Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.320]   use and another for dishonorable use?'
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.360]   What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.040]   much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order to make known the
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.200]   riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory?"
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:32.840]   Now Leslie asks, "It seems to imply that those who are not elect are not given a chance,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.560]   even a chance, to repent since they were born for destruction.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   Is this right?
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.880]   Many people are created with no chance of ever being saved?"
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.640]   That's her question.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:56.240]   My answer, "No, that would not be a faithful, biblical way of stating the situation.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:04.040]   Let me put beside each other two biblical truths that many people consider contradictory
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:12.240]   but are not, and then I'll draw out of those two truths an implication for Leslie's statement.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:21.760]   The first truth is, from all eternity, God has chosen from among the entire fallen, sinful
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.040]   humanity a people for himself but not everyone.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:36.120]   Thus, this selection is owing to no merit at all in those chosen people.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.320]   God pursues their salvation not only by effectively achieving the atonement for their sin through
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:51.600]   Christ but also by sovereignly overcoming all their rebellion and bringing them to saving
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   faith.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.520]   So that's the first truth.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.520]   Here's the second.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:07.160]   Anyone who perishes and is finally lost and cut off from God perishes because of real
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:16.340]   blameworthy self-exaltation, sin, and because they are hardened against the revelations
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.640]   of God's power and glory in nature or in the gospel.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.760]   No innocent people perish.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   Anybody who humbly wants Christ for a Savior is lost.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:40.360]   No one is judged or condemned for not knowing or believing or obeying reality to which they
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   had no access.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:53.200]   All lostness and all judgment are owing to sin and rebellion against the revelation that
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   we have.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.640]   That's the second truth.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   Now what keeps those two truths from being contradictory is this.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   The moral accountability of man is not destroyed by the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   Or to say it another way, God's final and decisive governance of all things, including
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.040]   who comes to faith, is compatible.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:32.920]   It fits with all humans being morally accountable to God for whether they believe or not.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.040]   Now we live in a world that by and large refuses to embrace God's purposeful sovereignty
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.960]   in all things.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.880]   That is Ephesians 1.11.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.000]   He works all things according to the counsel of his will.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.460]   People reject this largely because the only solution their minds can embrace for maintaining
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:05.000]   human accountability is the presumption of ultimate human self-determination, otherwise
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.640]   known as free will.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:14.700]   But ultimate human self-determination is not found anywhere in the Bible, nowhere.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:25.040]   But God's sovereignty is, and man's accountability is, and nowhere are these considered contradictory.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:32.360]   Therefore my response to Leslie's statement, "Many people are created with no chance
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:42.440]   of ever being saved," is to say everyone is being wooed and invited by God every day,
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:48.740]   either through natural revelation—the sun rising on the good and the evil, or the rain
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:55.800]   falling on the good and the bad—or through conscience, or they are being wooed and invited
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.660]   by gospel truth.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:04.720]   These revelations of God are their chance to be saved.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.460]   It is a real invitation.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:18.020]   It is real precisely because if they humbled themselves and received God's grace, they
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.180]   would be saved.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.300]   Those who do that, those who humble themselves and receive God's grace, they know that it
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.000]   was only the sovereign grace of God that enabled them to believe.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.380]   And those who don't do it know that it is because of their own sin, that they loved
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.360]   something else more than God, is why they didn't believe.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:50.140]   There will be no innocent people in hell, and there will be only forgiven sinners in
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.140]   heaven.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.140]   Very good.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.740]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for tackling one of the many questions about this
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   chapter.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.860]   Engaging from our inbox, I know a ton of you have questions about Romans 9.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.820]   And hundreds of questions have come in over the years on that single chapter alone.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.900]   And I want to end this episode by talking about a key book, Pastor John, you wrote.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.300]   You mentioned those early years of 1977 and 1979, years of research and writing, that
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.740]   became a full book on Romans 9 by the title, The Justification of God.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.420]   The Justification of God, one of the key John Piper titles early in his ministry.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.980]   As a professor, as I understand it, Pastor John had taught a Romans 9 to 11 exegesis
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:39.260]   course in 1976, and that inspired him to write articles on Romans 9 with his sabbatical time.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.720]   In the fall of 1979, he worked those articles into a book and finished up the first draft
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.580]   over his Easter break in 1980.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.460]   It's interesting that it was work on this book that really helped persuade him to leave
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.700]   the academy for the pastorate.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.340]   That's a story for another day.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.140]   But nevertheless, this book, The Justification of God, was picked up and published by Baker
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.340]   in 1983.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.220]   It was the second book, the first being Love Your Enemies, his doctoral dissertation published
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   in 1979.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:12.020]   But if you want a deep dive into Romans 9, this is the book to get, The Justification
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.260]   of God.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.380]   For the full benefit, you're going to need to know some Greek and Hebrew, but nevertheless,
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.240]   if you don't have it, you can benefit from it.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   Check it out.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.740]   Years of John Piper's exegesis and thought into that book, The Justification of God.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.060]   Well, we are so close to Christmas now.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.780]   Next time we look at one of the many awesome consequences of Christ's incarnation.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.100]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke, and I'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.740]   Thanks for listening.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:42.740]   [music]
