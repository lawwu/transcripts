[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Nathan writes in to ask, "Pastor John, you mentioned in episode 107 that one of
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360]   your seminary professors, Stan Fuller, helped to establish your framework for
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.240]   how to rightly read and interpret the Scriptures, called arching. I was
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.040]   wondering if you could give me one piece of advice to help me better read my
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:29.280]   English Bible better." Okay, since you just asked for one, here it is. Write down
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.520]   the text with a pen and paper, not with a computer. Don't type it on a computer.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.800]   Copy it out of your Bible with a pen on paper, either just a plain old sheet of
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.560]   paper or buy yourself a nice moleskin, call this notebook that you just bought,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.520]   your written Bible. And here's why. I'm saying write it out. Here's why. When I
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.440]   was in seminary, 23 years old, so this is 44 years ago, I began to see how when I began to
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.120]   learn arching from Dan Fuller, which had a step in it of writing every
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.280]   proposition of every paragraph on a different line and figuring out how
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.240]   those propositions relate to each other, I discovered that the very writing
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.560]   caused me to see things. So a few weeks later, after I began to see that, a young
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.160]   woman came up to me at Lake Avenue Church and she said, "I'm not getting
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.120]   anything out of my Bible reading. You got any ideas for me?" And I said, "Why don't
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.860]   you try to write it down? Just make that part of your Bible reading this week." She
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.960]   came back to me a week later and said, "I can't believe it! I can't believe what I'm
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.000]   seeing!" And she was so excited. So here's the reason, I think, why that is. Number
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   one, it slows you down. Most of us read the Bible and everything else too fast,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.520]   like sprinting through a rose garden, right? Let's just get through the
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.040]   rose garden here. I saw all the roses. I really did. Well, you did, but really did
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.960]   you? So don't sprint through the rose garden. The best way to not sprint
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.000]   through the rose garden is to write down the rose garden, write down the text. So
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.120]   it slows you down. Number two, it gives you a way to respond and retain. For me
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.360]   anyway, when I'm reading often and I feel something, I see something, I get a little
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.400]   frustrated because I know that if I keep reading, that feeling's gonna go away and
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   I'm gonna forget what I just saw. And if I'm writing it down, I can circle
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.120]   the word. I can underline the word. I can draw lines between the two words that I
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.280]   just saw. I can put a bracket in and scribble what I just observed, close the
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.200]   bracket and keep writing. So it gives me a way to respond and I have a
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   sense of, I could hold on to this. I could keep this because there it is now. I
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.960]   could come back tomorrow and see what I saw again. A third thing is that when you
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.040]   write the text, it raises more questions and it gives you an immediate way to
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.880]   preserve them right there. You can just write the question down. You don't have
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.280]   to answer it right there if you don't have time or you're not able to, but
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.600]   there they are. And asking questions is the key to understanding. And so anything
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.740]   that enables you to cultivate and then preserve and then eventually answer
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.680]   questions, that's gonna go, gonna take you deeper. And one last thing, this all
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.200]   leaves a record of God's dealings with you and your soul. And that's what we
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.800]   want. We want to meet God in the Bible. And in my experience, slow, meditative,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:48.080]   commenting, question-asking, reading is where I meet God. I don't meet God when
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.680]   I'm rushing through a text, when I'm willing to pause. And so get a pen, get a
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.760]   notebook or a piece of paper, open your Bible and copy out a paragraph. I don't
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.720]   mean, by the way, all four chapters that you're going to read today and you're
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.520]   trek through the Bible should be written down. I just mean, let part of your
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   experience be this, not all of it. Yes, thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
