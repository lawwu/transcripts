[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.820]   - Being 828, it seems fitting that we record an episode
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.840]   on suffering in honor of the precious truth
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.880]   that we cling to in Romans 828.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.080]   It's certainly not hard to find such an email.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.280]   Thousands of people email us out of the most tragic pain
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.880]   they have ever experienced.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   And one of my regrets with this podcast
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.080]   is that we can't reply to every one
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.520]   of those heartbreaking emails that you send to us.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.480]   I wish we could, but we simply can't.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.560]   But we can respond to this email from a podcast listener,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.400]   a very broken woman.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.720]   "Pastor John, I need your help.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   "Tragically back in 2007, I backed over and killed
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.640]   "my 18 month old grandson with a car.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.260]   "I was devastated.
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.920]   "I remain devastated.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.880]   "That day changed me.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.980]   "I was once a children's church director
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.740]   "and a Sunday school teacher.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.160]   "I don't serve anymore.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.320]   "13 years later, I can hardly drive without crying.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.720]   "The guilt I feel for my grandson is greater
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.600]   "than the guilt I feel for not serving God.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.340]   "People say I should be happy, he's in a better place.
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.320]   "Or they say God spared him a bad life,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.740]   "that he knew my grandson was going to go down a bad road.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.320]   "But what would you say?
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   "What would make me happy again, serving God again
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.300]   "and at peace without my grandson?
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.480]   "After all these years, Pastor John, can you help me?"
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.160]   - Whether I can be of help after all this time,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160]   I think she said 13 years, will depend on whether
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.520]   the Holy Spirit is pleased to take what I say
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.820]   and do the miracle, the ongoing miracle,
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.680]   that in myself I certainly am not able to do.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.120]   So my words now that I'm going to speak
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.020]   that I've prayed about, come in the hopes
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.160]   that there will be a touch of God
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.400]   and a miracle wrought through them,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.720]   which in and of themselves could never happen.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.980]   Now before I point our friend
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.940]   to three biblical considerations,
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.140]   let me say a word about Romans 8, 28,
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.140]   here on the eighth month and on the 28th day of 2020.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.260]   The flow of thought in Romans 8 goes like this.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.340]   We know that for those who love God
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.080]   and are called according to his purpose,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.780]   all things work together for good.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.780]   And then skip a few verses and you read, this is verse 35,
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.620]   "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.620]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.140]   or nakedness or danger or sword,"
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.820]   and you could add, "or running over your own grandchild?"
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.420]   "As it is written, for our sake,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.460]   we are being killed all day long.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.820]   We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.020]   And Paul responds to that litany of horrors
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.620]   that happened to God's people, "No, no,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.900]   we won't be separated from the love of Christ."
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.400]   And then he adds these words, "In all these things,"
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.460]   not instead of, but "In all these things,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.380]   we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.380]   So it's absolutely crucial whenever we use sight,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.980]   Romans 8:28, that we realize that verse
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.980]   does not spare us Christians,
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.300]   distress, famine, nakedness, danger,
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.860]   but rather makes us inseparable from Christ
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.480]   in these miseries, in them.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.580]   That's the clarification we must always keep before us.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.580]   Romans 8:28 is not a promise of escape from misery,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.100]   but a promise of being kept from delusion
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.300]   and unbelief and destruction in it,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.300]   and that in due time, God works it out for our good.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.940]   Now, here are three considerations
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.100]   that I would like our hurting friend,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.440]   still hurting after 13 years, to consider.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.720]   Number one, when Jesus broke into Paul's life
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.920]   on the Damascus road, he said, "Saul, Saul,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.940]   why are you persecuting me?"
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.000]   Acts 9, 4.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.400]   Now, at first, Paul had no idea what this meant.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.560]   Persecuting Jesus, the risen Lord of the universe?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.880]   I don't even believe you exist.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.360]   Luke had just said three verses earlier
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.380]   that Paul's persecution involved, quote,
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.380]   "Saul was still breathing threats and murder
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.240]   against the disciples of the Lord."
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.500]   Acts 9, 1.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.160]   Two words stand out, murder and still.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   And Noel and I just read devotions last night,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.420]   by the way, in Acts 25, I believe,
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.820]   where Paul uses the plural for murders
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.760]   that he had been involved in.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.660]   I had never noticed that plural before,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.780]   but here he says he's still,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.180]   he's still breathing out murder,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.160]   meaning I was part of Stephen's killing,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.740]   and I'm still doing the same thing on my way to Damascus.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.520]   He was a Christian killer.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.700]   And on the Damascus road, Jesus told him
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.020]   that he was not merely a Christian killer,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.060]   he was a Christ killer.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.700]   You are persecuting me, Jesus.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.740]   You touch my followers, you touch me.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.620]   You imprison them, you imprison me.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.220]   You kill them, you kill me.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.460]   And it appears from 1 Timothy 1.15
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.980]   and 1 Corinthians 15.9
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.680]   that Paul never, never forgot it.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.820]   He never stopped feeling the sting,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.560]   the horror of being a Christian killer
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.260]   and a Christ killer.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.860]   He did not mean to be a Christ killer,
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.580]   but he did mean to be a Christian killer.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.340]   And here he is now at the end of his life
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.500]   in 1 Timothy saying that he still feels it.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.580]   He feels like the foremost,
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.220]   he calls himself the foremost or the chief of sinners
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.140]   because according to 1 Corinthians 15.9,
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.300]   he persecuted and killed Christians
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.840]   and through them the Lord himself.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   Now, my point is not that running over your own grandchild
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.240]   is like killing Christians intentionally
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.300]   or killing Christ inadvertently.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.680]   My point is this, here's something so horrible
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.680]   in Paul's life, in his background, that he did,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.320]   he never, never stopped taking it into account.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.040]   He never got beyond it.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   He never stopped thinking on it and its implications.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.240]   It never stopped playing an emotional role in his life.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.840]   So I'm suggesting that the way forward
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   is not to be sought mainly in forgetting
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.160]   or God forbid, minimizing the horror,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.920]   but in fact, remembering, owning,
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   finding Paul's supernatural way of living with the grief
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.600]   and the wrong that was done in such a way
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.920]   that it does not paralyze ministry,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   but mysteriously, painfully, even beautifully deepens it.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.480]   Read the context of 1 Timothy 1:15
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.100]   and meditate on that possibility.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.640]   That's my first observation.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.000]   Here's the second one, and it follows from the first.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.960]   It may be that the Lord is calling you
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.440]   to think of this tragedy and its effect
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.420]   not as a wound to be healed,
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.080]   but as a disability to bear.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.560]   Some disabilities are physical.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.600]   Jacob wrestled with God, God put his hip out of joint,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.160]   and he walked with a limp for the rest of his life
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   as an unavoidable reminder of his encounter with God.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.960]   Some disabilities are mental,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.280]   and some are emotional and spiritual,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   and it might help if your mindset shifts
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.520]   from getting beyond the pain, beyond the remorse,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.080]   beyond the horrible, vivid memory, get beyond,
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.260]   it might help if your mindset shifts
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.800]   from getting beyond all that
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   to acknowledging the ongoing presence of the pain,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.640]   the remorse, the memory, as miraculously transformed
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.960]   from a ministry-paralyzing reality
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   to a ministry-deepening, softening, empowering reality.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.760]   Think of the Christ-exalting people you know
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.600]   who have a profound disability.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.480]   We could all probably think of one or two or three,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.000]   and perhaps they have it
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.760]   because of this disability that they have.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.560]   Perhaps they have it because of a mindless accident
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   and by a miracle of sovereign grace,
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   they have transformed that life-ruining disability
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:32.040]   into a life-giving, power-in-weakness ministry of grace.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.600]   That's my second observation, an alteration of mindset.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.120]   And now finally, the third observation,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   which follows from that, in a sense, is an extension.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.280]   Of the first two, surely one of the great hindrances
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   to ministry after such an unspeakable calamity
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.080]   is the deep sense that if I rejoice,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.560]   or if I delight in some ministry,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.800]   I will, by that delight, by that joy,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.840]   treat the death of my grandchild with disrespect.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.480]   I will, by that joy, minimize the horror of the deed
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.440]   and the loss to the family.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.580]   So there hangs over you a sense that you dare not,
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.760]   you dare not return to any form of normalcy
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   lest you make light of what feels infinitely heavy.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.880]   And here's what I'm suggesting, that minimizing,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.120]   that minimizing is not gonna happen
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.300]   after 13 years with you, it's not.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.300]   The voice of 13 years of sorrow and ministry paralysis
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.180]   is to show you that you have a disability
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.680]   which you never will leave behind.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.920]   You will never become chipper about it.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.640]   You'll never become frivolous about it.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.800]   You'll never become callous about it.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.080]   You'll never become indifferent to that awful moment
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.800]   and that immeasurable loss.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.560]   You won't, you won't.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.680]   I'm suggesting that the grief and the loss
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.520]   are not a disease that heals,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.960]   they're an amputation that produces a lifelong limp.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.920]   You won't ever run the same.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.080]   And that limp, I am suggesting,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   is the miraculous capacity to minister to other people
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.240]   with a kind of joy.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.000]   Mark that word, a kind of joy.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.120]   And a kind of hope and a kind of peace
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.600]   that only a person can have who has drunk
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.560]   this bitter cup that you have drunk.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.000]   It will be unique to you, your particular kind of joy,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   your hope, your peace.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.460]   What did Paul mean when he said in 2 Corinthians 6:10
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.480]   that he carried out his ministry as sorrowful,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.580]   yet always rejoicing?
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.960]   Could it be that part of the story
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.520]   that Paul carried with him all the time
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.860]   was the memory that he was a Christ killer?
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:21.800]   As indeed all of us are in one sense Christ killers.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.600]   Whatever the sorrow was,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.680]   and oh, how many reasons Paul had to be sorrowful.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.100]   Whatever the sorrow was,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   what matters most is that Paul found a miracle of grace
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:43.840]   to transform the sorrowful, emotional weight of his past,
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.480]   transform it from a ministry paralyzing memory
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.780]   into a ministry deepening power,
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.780]   even with a kind of joy that was peculiar
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.440]   to this amazing man.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   Not a superficial joy,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.340]   but the kind of joy that only the chief of sinners
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.140]   can have in the grace of God.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.240]   And that's my prayer for you.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.520]   - Heavy topic, but no overstatement to say
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.560]   that Christ is relevant for our deepest tragedies.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.600]   And thank you for sending such personal emails into us.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.320]   It is no small thing that you are willing
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.160]   to open up your life and share with us
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   the rawest wounds that you endure.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.600]   I only wish we could answer every heartbreaking email
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.320]   that we get, but I pray that this episode will serve
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.960]   many of you who resonate with the pain.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.440]   Well, next up we're gonna ask,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.800]   is a career in marketing vain?
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.000]   This is the type of question that comes in regularly to us
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.960]   from Christians who work in marketing,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.080]   but also from those who work in retail clothing
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.880]   and in the fashion world.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.000]   Does my work matter?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.880]   Pushing luxury goods to people who don't need them.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.920]   It's an honest question, and it's up next time on Monday.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.000]   I'm Tony Renke, we'll see you on the other side
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.960]   of the weekend.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.360]   Thank you for listening, and we'll see you then.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:30.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
