[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   What is the story with neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's in particular?
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.400]   How can we offset it?
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.520]   And perhaps as importantly, how can we all slow our own cognitive decline irrespective
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.440]   of whether or not we get what is called Alzheimer's dementia?
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.960]   So Alzheimer's disease is both the most prevalent form of dementia and the most prevalent neurodegenerative
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.560]   disease.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.120]   So it occupies that unique spot.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.440]   We're talking about roughly 6 million people in the United States have Alzheimer's disease.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.880]   That's one in, let's see, I mean, about 2% of the total population.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.960]   Okay.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.220]   But that doesn't include those with mild cognitive impairment or pre-dementia or other forms
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.220]   of dementia.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.080]   And of course, the right metric is not what percent of the population, which of course
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   includes children, things like that.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   It's, you know, so...
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080]   That's a function of age.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.760]   But is age the major risk factor for getting Alzheimer's?
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.880]   We stay with glaucoma, a disease I'm much more familiar with because my lab worked on
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.920]   it for many years.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.720]   The biggest risk factor for getting glaucoma is age.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.800]   The greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease is age.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.240]   The greatest risk factor for cancer is age.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.880]   We tend to not spend a lot of time talking about that because it's not a modifiable risk.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.100]   So you know, we tend to focus on modifiable risk factors.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.840]   So what else can we tell you just to give you kind of lay of the land?
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   So the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease would probably be Lewy body dementia
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.940]   followed by Parkinson's disease, although the rate of growth of Parkinson's disease
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.940]   is the highest.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.780]   So I think we'd probably be most, you know, those three diseases we want to really be
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.900]   paying a lot of attention to.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.860]   As you know, there are a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380]   Every one of these things is devastating.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.380]   Like multiple sclerosis.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.380]   Yeah, multiple sclerosis, ALS, Huntington's disease.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.520]   These are awful, awful diseases.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.700]   There are also other kinds of dementia.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.760]   Vascular dementia is not Alzheimer's dementia, but it produces comparable symptoms.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.260]   Each of these things, by the way, are slightly different.
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.100]   Lewy body is a dementia.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.700]   It's a dementing disease, but it also has a movement component.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.220]   So it sort of sits on a spectrum that's sort of, you know, loosely halfway between Alzheimer's
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.020]   disease and Parkinson's disease.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.660]   We talked obviously about age being the number one risk factor.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.700]   Kind of not that interesting because you can't do anything about it.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.220]   So the real goal is, as we age, what are we doing to reduce risk?
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.500]   Well, let's start with an important gene.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   The gene that everybody's heard of, certainly came up a lot on the Limitless special where
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.420]   Chris Hemsworth was, you know, made the decision to reveal something that none of us expected
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.020]   when we started that whole series, which was that he ended up being homozygous for the
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.940]   ApoE4 isoform.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.820]   So maybe folks understand, we have two copies of every gene.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.900]   So for gene X, you have copy that you got from your mom and copy that you got from your
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.540]   dad and the ApoE gene is kind of a unique gene in that it really, it has three different
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.780]   isoforms that are all considered normal.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.220]   None of them are mutations.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.980]   So you have the E2 isoform, the E3 isoform and the E4 isoform.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.460]   The E4 isoform is the OG isoform.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.340]   That's the one that we have historically had as far back as we can go.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.420]   We actually think the E4 isoform offered a lot of advantages back in the day.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.260]   It's a bit of a pro-inflammatory isoform and it certainly offered protection against infections,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.420]   especially parasitic infections in the CNS, which would have been a really important thing
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.340]   to select for 200,000 years ago.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.820]   How do parasites get into the CNS?
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.500]   I mean, you have a blood-brain barrier, you got a thick skull.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   I mean, not you.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   Trauma.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.540]   I'm not calling, I'm not telling you you have a thick skull, but, but I mean, it just seems
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.340]   like parasites and other tissues would be an issue.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.740]   Because what we're talking about here is brain disease.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.740]   Anyway.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.740]   I don't want to take us off course.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.740]   But it also could have protected them.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.400]   It probably offered some protection outside of the brain as well.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:33.540]   Anyway, the, the E3 isoform I think showed up, I think 50,000 years ago.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.980]   And the E2 isoform showed up very recently, about 10,000 years ago.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:46.900]   Now today we realize that there's a clear stratification of risk when it comes to Alzheimer's
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.140]   disease that tracks with those isoforms.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.860]   So because you have two copies, you basically have six combinations of how you can combine
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.860]   those genes.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.380]   You could be 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.780]   The prevalence of them is basically as follows.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.760]   3/3 is now the most common, 3 is the most common.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.220]   So double 3 is 55-ish percent of the population.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.940]   The next most common is the 3/4, which is about 25% of the population.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.680]   And then after that, most things are kind of a rounding error.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.900]   So 2/3s and 2/4s would be the next most common, 4/4s are very rare, and 2/2s are the rarest
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.900]   of them all.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.500]   2/2s are less than 1%.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   4/4s are about 1-2%.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.120]   Very important point here is that the E4 genes are not deterministic.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.160]   So they're highly associated with the risk, but they're not deterministic.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.200]   There are at least three deterministic genes in Alzheimer's disease.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.360]   One is called PSCN1, another one is called PSCN2, and another one is called APP.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.040]   Those genes collectively make up about 1% of cases of people with Alzheimer's disease.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.240]   So they're fortunately very rare genes, but sadly they are deterministic, meaning if you
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.960]   have those genes, you do get Alzheimer's disease.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.480]   And what's perhaps most devastating about those genes is how early the onset is of the
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480]   disease.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.520]   These are people that are usually getting Alzheimer's disease in their 50s.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.040]   So we do have a patient in our practice, actually she's spoken about this very openly, who's
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   mom had one of these genes.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.520]   And she got Alzheimer's disease in her early 50s.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.560]   I think she might have made it into her 60s before she died.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.280]   But absolutely devastating consequences here.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   Why do people with Alzheimer's die?
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.360]   Because I know about the hippocampal degeneration, hippocampus of course being an area of the
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.860]   brain important for learning and memory.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.480]   But is there brainstem degeneration?
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.760]   Do they lose breathing centers or cardiovascular control?
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.320]   Usually what happens is it's sort of failure to thrive, aspiration, things like that.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.920]   So it's usually they just stop eating.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.600]   Or they can't control secretions, they aspirate, they get a pneumonia.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.240]   Or they really lose the ability to even sense pain in their body.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.080]   And therefore they'll get an ulcer and they don't realize it and it'll become cellulitic
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   and they'll develop a horrible infection in response to it.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080]   I see.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   So it's a body vulnerability.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.280]   The reason I ask is every once in a while a news report will come out based on a legitimate
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.520]   case study where they'll do a scan on some person and discover that they're missing literally
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.480]   half their cerebral cortex, like huge chunks of brain and they're functioning relatively
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   normally.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.440]   And so here we're talking about a neurodegenerative disease of relatively, it's widespread, but
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.840]   there are a few hotspots of course in the brain that degenerate more profoundly than
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.400]   others and the people dying.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   So that makes sense.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.280]   So it extends to lack of peripheral awareness or control and then some acute injury or infection.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.160]   Got it.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.280]   You mentioned earlier some of the controversy, right?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.800]   So what are we talking about here?
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.240]   Well it's, and I do write about this at length in the chapter on Alzheimer's disease because
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.360]   I think this is a very important point, right?
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.280]   Which is the index case for Alzheimer's disease, there's always an index case, right?
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.240]   The quote unquote patient zero.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:26.240]   The index case was a woman who, you know, a hundred years later we realized had an APP
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   mutation.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.260]   These are APP or PSEN1, but she had one of these deterministic genes that led to a very
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.000]   early onset of disease, which by the way, without which we may not have come up with
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.100]   the diagnosis because had she just got Alzheimer's disease in her 70s, it would have just been
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.080]   referred to as senility, which is, you know, was not interesting enough to pay attention
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.900]   to.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:59.280]   But I think it probably set the field on the path towards an overemphasis on amyloid beta.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.600]   And it's not really clear how important amyloid is, which is not to say it's not important.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:16.680]   It is important and there's no ambiguity that amyloid is responsible for the changes that
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.400]   we see in the brain, but it's not crystal clear because there are lots of autopsies
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.960]   that are done on people that are completely healthy and have died with no cognitive impairment
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.480]   and they're chock full of amyloid.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   So what we don't fully understand is exactly what does removing amyloid do.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.080]   The other thing that complicates the story is there has been no shortage of drugs that
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.000]   target amyloid that have seemed unsuccessful.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.460]   And just to clarify, when you say amyloid, you mean people have died with their brains
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.000]   examined in autopsy and see that there are tons of so-called amyloid plaques?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Correct.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.520]   Amyloid is different than arterial plaques, of course, but within the brain.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:07.200]   So the two hallmarks of Alzheimer's histopathologically would be plaques and tangles.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.280]   And even that now is, of course, coming under question.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.080]   But that's what we teach every neuroscience graduate student.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   It's what we teach every undergraduate.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.540]   It's also what we teach every medical student, and not just at Stanford, but everywhere.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.340]   So I have heard that the link between APP and whether or not one develops genes for
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.140]   it related to APP and whether or not it's cleaved at one site or another, which is what
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.100]   you were describing, and risk for Alzheimer's...
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.100]   So it's basically a cleavage.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   It's a cleavage question.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.100]   Right.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.940]   So people with the APP mutation, I think, have one extra cleavage site.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.540]   They result in one extra cleavage of amyloid and then it misfolds.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.060]   And the misfolding is what the plaque is that's being created.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.080]   That also then predisposes them to the neurofibrillary tangles.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.740]   And again...
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.300]   But all this is under question now, right?
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.300]   Well...
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   I mean, this is what I was told.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.380]   And when I look, it sounds like there were some papers early in the chain of discovery
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:11.580]   and the research in Alzheimer's that were either wrong because they were intentionally
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.580]   falsified.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.980]   There was an intentionally falsified paper on one particular amyloid variant.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.260]   And that clearly set the field back a decade because a lot of people went down that rabbit
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.660]   hole based on deliberately falsified data.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.660]   What happened to that guy?
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.660]   I'm going to assume...
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.660]   I don't know why I assume it was a guy.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.660]   But what happened to that guy?
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.660]   That's a good question.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.780]   I think I wrote one piece about it when it happened.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.500]   I actually reached out to the person who broke the story because I wanted to have them on
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.180]   my podcast.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.500]   And I forget why he didn't do it.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.100]   I forget why he wouldn't commit to it or something like that.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.380]   But I thought it was a little odd because I thought this would be a great way to talk
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.100]   about this.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.420]   I do not know what came of that scandal.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.500]   In other words, I haven't paid attention to it for probably nine months.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   So I don't know.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.800]   You know, obviously the paper has probably been recalled, but I don't know what disciplinary
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.660]   action was taken.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.140]   The field is...
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.140]   I don't know.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.120]   I don't want to speak like I'm in the field because I'm not.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.740]   So I want to be careful what I say.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:24.740]   But I think the field is probably in a bit of a crisis because there have been so many
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:32.620]   bets placed on anti-amyloid therapies and amyloid biomarkers and amyloid everything.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.440]   And we just haven't seen efficacy, right?
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:42.660]   So contrast that with cardiovascular disease where, you know, you have this ApoB biomarker,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.700]   you understand the pathophysiology of how it works, you have drugs that target it.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.540]   So you have a biomarker, so you give somebody a drug that lowers ApoB, you can measure ApoB.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.460]   That's a really important and obvious thing to be able to do.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.080]   And then you have clinical outcomes, which is, oh, when you take a bunch of people in
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.580]   primary prevention, it takes this long before you see an effect.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.140]   In secondary prevention, it only takes this long to see an effect, right?
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.100]   Different risk stratifications, all these different things.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.220]   We don't have any of that for Alzheimer's disease.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   So we do use...
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.940]   There are now serum amyloid biomarkers that we use and we do track these in our highest
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:23.860]   risk patients, but only because we believe, and I don't know if we're right, by the way,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.940]   that lower is better.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.860]   And therefore, if we make these changes to you and your serum amyloid levels come down,
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.420]   that that tells us something about what's happening in your brain that's favorable.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:41.180]   But I mean, I would hate to represent that we are practicing nearly the level of precision
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.300]   medicine there that we are in cardiovascular medicine.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.900]   When it comes to Alzheimer's disease, maybe take a step back.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:55.540]   When it comes to brain health, I think there are a handful of things that seem unequivocally
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.180]   true.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:03.120]   And there's a lot of stuff that is signal to noise ratio that's really low.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.940]   So the unequivocally true things for brain health are sleep matters.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:17.140]   Another unequivocally true thing for brain health is that lower LDL cholesterol and ApoB
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.100]   is better than higher.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.900]   Another thing that is unequivocally true is not having type 2 diabetes matters.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.900]   So having really...
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.900]   Being insulin...
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.900]   By...
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.900]   By insulin sensitive or not insulin sensitive.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.580]   Being insulin sensitive matters.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.180]   Sleeping adequately matters.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.060]   Having lower lipids matters.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.380]   Those three things are clear.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.500]   And the fourth one that is unequivocally clear is exercise matters.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   More exercise...
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   A specific form of exercise.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   Very...
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.720]   I mean, so I tried to answer this question on a recent AMA that I did because the answer
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.900]   is more is always better.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.260]   But if you...
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.600]   If I tried to have one of our analysts look at it through the lens of if you could only
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.060]   exercise three hours a week, what would be the highest use case?
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.780]   And our interpretation of the literature was if you could only spend three hours a
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:17.460]   week exercising, you'd be best off doing one hour of low intensity cardio, one hour of
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.860]   strength and one hour of interval training.
