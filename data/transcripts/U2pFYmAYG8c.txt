[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Podcast listener Amber in Doylan, Louisiana writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.000]   "Pastor John, the Oregon shooting recently really shook me up.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.800]   I turned my life over to Christ a little over two years ago.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000]   I've learned a lot, but I have a lot to learn yet.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'm trying to strengthen my faith, but in the meantime, I asked myself,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.800]   'What would I do?' My response was scary.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.800]   I'm not sure I could say I'm a Christian if a gun is pointed in my face.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.000]   Especially if my children are with me.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I know that Jesus warned us not to deny him on earth,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   but I can't help but wonder if doing it to save our life,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   even though we don't mean it, is it punishable?'"
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Amber?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Well, I love honesty, so let's deal with it.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Jesus said, "Whoever denies me before men, I will deny before my Father who is in heaven."
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And I think the only situation he has in mind is the one where we're being threatened.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Otherwise, the issue of denying him doesn't come up.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.200]   A few verses later, he says, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   And whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   Whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   So that's the context of losing your life instead of denying Jesus.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   So the Christian, he says, loves me, loves Christ, so much that denying him is more fearful than death.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   Of course, saying that is one thing, but actually having the wherewithal to do it in the moment of death is another,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   which is what she's saying, rightly.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   When I personally, John Piper, have worried that I may not have strength or power to suffer or be tortured or die for Christ,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   I've been helped by pondering 1 Peter 4.14. It says this, "If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   Now, doesn't that text, even though it's only talking about an insult, doesn't the principle hold that in extraordinary situations,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   the reason you can be blessed in the moment of being assaulted, insulted, criticized, or threatened with death,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   the reason you can be blessed is because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you?
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   And I take that to mean that God shows up in a way in that moment, which he doesn't elsewhere,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   which means my sense of ability to endure it at this moment, sitting here at my table, may not be all that I'll have when I get there to that moment.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   And I don't know how many of our listeners are familiar with Corrie Ten Boom and her story, who was in a concentration camp,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   and before she was taken there, knowing that she might someday have to pay with her life, which she didn't, it turns out,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   she asked her father how that would be, how could she have strength.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   And the story is that her father said to her, "When I send you on the train to go somewhere,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   do I give you the ticket a month ahead of time, or do I give you the ticket as you get on the train?"
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   And the point she was making is, "God will give us what we need when the train of suffering and death arrives in the station."
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   And that's been very helpful to me, because I think that is what 1 Peter 4:14 is saying.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   Now, in the meantime, I think there are things that we all should be doing to get ready,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   that the Holy Spirit will make us, will use these things to help us be ready when the hour of our testing comes.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   And let me just mention a few of these.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   One, cultivate a regular attentiveness to the other world, to heaven, the world of heaven, where Christ is and His rewards are,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   where all the saints are, where all the sorrow will be taken away,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   and where we'll be sinning no more, and where pain and depression will be over.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   2 Corinthians 4:18, "We look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   We should cultivate a mindset that is heavenward.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Second, ponder often that there are far worse things than death.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Matthew 10:28, "Do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   Fear him who can cast soul and body into hell."
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   There's way worse things than death.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   Third, ponder often that the truth that Christ already died for you, He did it so that you might live and die for Him.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   2 Corinthians 5:14, "The love of Christ controls me because we have concluded this,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   that one has died for all, therefore all have died.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   And He died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   but for Him who for their sakes died and rose again."
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Fourth, keep it clear in your mind that suffering and death for Christ are not surprising in this world.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   They are normal and expected.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   1 Peter 4:12, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is coming upon you to test you as though something strange were happening to you."
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   So develop the mindset that such tests are not extraordinary.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   They are biblically ordinary.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Do not fear what you are about to suffer.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   Revelation 2.10, "Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you in prison that you may be tested,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   So when it happens, it's not a punishment for us, it's a reward of faithfulness.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   Fifth, meditate regularly on the truths of Philippians 1.21, "For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me, yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   Hard pressed between the two, my desire is to depart and be with Christ."
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   Pray that into reality every day.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   Six, keep clear and firm in your mind and in your heart that the Lord will take care of your children if you die.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   No matter how you die.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   You might have a heart attack this afternoon.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   My God will supply every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   And oh, what a need we feel that our children be cared for.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   And when it comes to legacy, think deeply on this.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   When it comes to legacy and impact, remember, your death for Christ could be the greatest possible gift you could give to your children.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   And the seventh thing I would say, last thing I would say, of course, this is beyond us.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   None of us in ourselves will die for Jesus.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   This is a gift of grace if we are able to trust Him and love Him in that moment.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   So pray. That's the main thing here.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Pray that you will not be like Peter who boldly said, "I'll never deny you."
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   And then he fails three times.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   We need to pray, "Oh God, don't let me boast as though I could do this.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Help me to depend utterly on you."
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those wise words of preparation for such a day.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   Should we be called on to pay this price?
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   And thank you, Amber, for the excellent question.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   Send your questions into us via email at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.

[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   [Silence]
