[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   [Music]
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.380]   How do we know if we have truly experienced the spiritual reality of new birth?
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.920]   How do I know if God has acted on my life?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.660]   This is such a critical question in our lives and John Piper addressed it in a 2007 Christmas
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.600]   sermon of all places.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.240]   We pick up with John Piper citing 1 John 5 verse 12.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.100]   Verse 12, "Whoever has the Son has life.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.840]   Whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.080]   The Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld His glory.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.240]   Glory is of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth, and from His fullness
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.120]   we have all received grace upon grace."
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.060]   That's where our life comes from.
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.280]   The Son, the Word made flesh is our life.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.440]   This is the testimony.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.640]   How do you know that you're a child of God?
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.040]   How do I know that John Piper is alive?
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.080]   It's my birth certificate.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.600]   Does anybody believe you're alive because you have on file a birth certificate?
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600]   You don't because you breathe.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.340]   It's exactly the same with Jesus Christ.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.160]   You know that you're a child of God because you breathe.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.560]   You're alive.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   You see Him for who He is.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.040]   You love Him for who He is.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.000]   You trust Him for who He is.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.080]   You embrace Him for who He is.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.360]   That's how you know you're alive.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.000]   The testimony is within you.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.400]   And what is it again?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.640]   The testimony?
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.520]   Verse 11, "This is the testimony.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.760]   God gave us life."
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.880]   That's how you know you're alive, to Him, alive to God, and dying to sin.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.840]   The aim of the new birth is to awaken faith in the crucified, incarnate Son of God.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.680]   And if there were no incarnate, crucified Son of God, then the new birth would not be
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.340]   performed because the point of it would not be possible.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:26.000]   The incarnation of the Son of God is necessary because the life that we have in the new birth,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.340]   in union with Him, is the life of the Son of the incarnate Christ.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.320]   I am the way, the truth, and the life, and I became the way by being man.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.860]   I come now to close with justification and purification, or if you want to use the old
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.460]   sanctification, you can, but purity is what's used in this text.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.800]   I'm going to use it.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.740]   Look at 1 John 3, 3 through 5, "And everyone who thus hopes in Him," in other words,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.340]   if you're deeply confident that you're going to see Him someday and become like Him,
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.860]   that's what that's referring to.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.420]   Verse 3, "Everyone who thus hopes in Him purifies himself as he is pure.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.500]   Everyone who makes a practice of sinning practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.540]   You know that He appeared to take away sins, and in Him there is no sin."
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.740]   John says, "If you've experienced the new birth, and thus your heart has been awakened
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.860]   to hope in Jesus Christ, and you cannot wait until He appears because all your sin will
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.700]   be done away with, and you won't be battling with the internet anymore, and you won't be
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.420]   battling with pride anymore, and you won't be battling with selfishness anymore, and
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.420]   you won't be battling with all the bitterness and anger in your life, you'll be free and
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.740]   like Him if that's the passion of your life."
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.700]   This text says, "You will purify yourself now."
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.300]   If you want it to happen in the future, you're just kidding yourself if you don't want it
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.660]   to happen now.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.780]   "Oh, He's going to show up someday, and then I'll really want to be pure."
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.620]   You won't.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.340]   I used to play those games when I was a kid.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.800]   Get saved when I'm old, because it's boring to be saved.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.820]   So get saved when you're old.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.260]   It won't happen.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.900]   The hardness will creep over you, and you will lose all your capacity to know Him, see
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.460]   Him, love Him, and God will withdraw from you, and you will perish, thinking that on
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.700]   your deathbed you could repent, and you'll be an Esau pleading for repentance, and it
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.100]   will not be given.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.060]   Don't play that game.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.820]   If you're 30 years old, don't play it.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.140]   If you're 40, don't play it.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.140]   50, don't play it.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.140]   And sure, don't play it.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.560]   If you're six, don't play that game.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.540]   We will purify ourselves, meaning we're going to fight, right?
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.740]   We're going to fight.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.820]   Nobody in this room is perfect.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.420]   Nobody will be pure perfectly before you die.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.660]   The question is, who's fighting?
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.060]   Who's fighting?
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.300]   Who says, "Yes, I want Him to come.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.620]   Yes, I'd like to be like Him perfectly.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.700]   It grieves me not to be more like Him than I am.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.460]   Now I'm going to fight this thing."
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.460]   Who's that?
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.900]   It's the children of God talking.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.220]   I don't care how many times you fall down, if you get up talking like that, you're a
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.780]   child of God.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.780]   Amen.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.140]   That is such a powerful little clip, and it was taken from a sermon titled "The Reason
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.700]   the Son of God Appeared Was to Destroy the Works of the Devil," a Christmas sermon from
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.020]   John Piper preached back on December 23, 2007, and the clip was emailed in to us by Christopher
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.020]   Burdeen from Oklahoma City.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.300]   Thank you, Christopher, for the clip, and John Piper is going to return with us tomorrow,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.500]   and a listener wants to ask whether tardiness and chronic lateness is a sin issue.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.980]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.340]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
