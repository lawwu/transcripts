[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Thank you, Chairman. I'm speaking first not because the male has priority over the female,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   but because the hors d'oeuvre comes in front of the main course.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Shortly after I started coming to Westminster Chapel with my parents and my sisters in 1948,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   my father took it into his head to ask Dr and Mrs Lloyd-Jones for a holiday in the west of Ireland.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And I remember lecturing him, as sons do, and saying,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "Two thousand people come to this church and thousands more come to hear him preach elsewhere.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Why do you think they would want to accept your invitation?"
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And thus do 23-year-old sons know better than their parents.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I couldn't imagine the great doctor of this pulpit on the golf links or playing tennis or fishing or any of the things we did.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   But I was wrong. They came and they played golf, not admittedly with skill, but with enormous enthusiasm.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And for the first time I saw the other side of the most powerful Christian preacher and teacher.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It was his teaching that had drawn our family here first.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   In 1947 we began to come first of all to the Friday night discussions that filled the Institute Hall
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   to hear him make the audience work out the Christian attitude to the questions that they themselves had raised.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   He knew how to teach, not only so that you didn't forget,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   but so that in future you knew how to begin on any problem that came up in your own experience.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And it was always scripturally based.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You think that Paul may have said something about it?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Paul wrote a number of letters. Which one was it in?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And so you had to think very hard about that.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And finally you might drop on the right one. Ephesians. Very well then.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   There were four chapters in Ephesians. Which chapter was it?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And you may have got the third chapter.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And then he said, "And there are so many verses in the third chapter and which verse was it?"
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Until finally you put your finger on the exact quotation.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And then it was put in its context,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and then it was compared with other parts of the Bible on the same subject,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   until finally we were all clear to begin with what the Bible was saying.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Not because he had told us, but because he had made us work it through for ourselves.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And then we had to apply it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And here he would try to make us separate our well-worn prejudices
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   from the balance of biblical teaching.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yes, indeed I understand that point of view, Mr. Cathewood.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And holding that as you do, you would also logically hold the following, would you not?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And you would cautiously assent.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And that being so, and as he took you down another step on your road of error,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   you would begin to see where you were going and would hesitate.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Come, come, Mr. Cathewood.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Do you not agree that that is the logic of your position?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   You do, do you not?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And having seen at last where your logic took you,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   you would be forced back to the beginning.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And having recanted in full public view of your error, you would never make that mistake again.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   He once apologized for pressing me so hard.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He said, "You can take it, but there are others who hold the views you're putting
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   who could not take it, and really I'm teaching them through you."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I felt better about it after that.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And as I learnt myself later on taking a discussion here in Westminster,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   discussions are not actually easy to lead.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   In a talk or in a sermon, you map out your own logical route,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and you don't have to prepare for all the objections and diversions,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   because you're on the platform and they're down there and not asking you any questions.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   They may think about it, but they haven't an opportunity of putting them.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But in leading a discussion, anything may arise.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And if you've not got the whole framework within which your doctrinal theme sits,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   then you're lost.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   If the line of thought is irrelevant,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   then you have to persuade the contributor very gently that it really is another subject.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Of course, sometimes it was so irrelevant that the doctor simply used to say,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   "Yes, Mr. Smith, very, very interesting. Now has anyone else got any point on that?"
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And you would know that Mr. Smith was not really on the ball.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And you have to know where and how it fits, if it is relevant,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   so that the contributor can be led with the class to the connection,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and that that facet of the truth can be fitted in where it belongs and properly illuminated.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   But of course, that requires a wide knowledge of the subject that you're discussing,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and all the arguments that have been put theologically on that subject,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and that needs not only a well-stocked mind,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   but of course the ability to assess arguments as they come up,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   against the framework of doctrine, what you know and what you've read,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and also the spiritual sensitivity to detect in those arguments,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   however well put, a tendency to truth or a tendency to error.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And the doctor's vast reading not only gave him a knowledge of the arguments,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   but his supreme medical skill as a diagnostician gave him a superbly analytical and logical mind.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You could see him, as the discussion went on, separating out the strands of the argument,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   dividing the false from the true,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   showing why certain strands were really dangerous and would not hold,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   which strands were true and could be relied on,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and where they needed strengthening with others before they could be put to the test.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And he showed our generation, clearly, that the strand of pietistic evangelicalism,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   the muscular Christianity of the Vastian public school camps, which was all the vogue then,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   the devotional piety of the brethren in which I was brought up,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   the emotional dedication of the great conventions,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   the revivalism of the big interdenominational mission,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   none of these were enough.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   He, almost alone, stopped the retreat in the face of liberal humanism,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   which the Church had not dared to meet head on.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   He led the evangelical wing of the Church back into the centre of theological argument,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   not by conceding a thing, but by going back to its foundations in the Reformation.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And he, almost alone to begin with,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   wove in again the strong central strand of Reformed theology to evangelical teaching,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   a strand which had almost been snapped off in the late 19th century
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   when Spurgeon seemed to lose to the rising tide of liberalism in the downgrade controversy.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   The Reformed theology, which illuminated the immense logical sweep of the Christian gospel,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   seemed to me to be like the great mutually supporting archers of a majestic cathedral.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And it came as a revelation to those of us brought up on a diet of blessed thoughts and texts for the day.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And having read through Calvin and the Westminster Confessions, through Hodge and Birkhoff,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   having seen that the Reformed doctrine of the sovereignty of God, the Creator,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   transformed the natural sciences and indeed the whole of society,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   having seen evolution as no more than speculative metaphysics
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   and liberalism and higher criticism for old-fashioned heresies,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   we then, being so struck with all of this, tended to forget
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   that the majestic vaulted roof of Christian doctrine
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   was to cover and to protect the human relationships of a living Church.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   But Dr. Lloyd-Jones did not forget that.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   All the doctrine was dead without the strand of love, a passionate love for God,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   which, as he kept on saying from this pulpit, God would return,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   flooding us with an overwhelming sense of his presence
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   and a love for each other by which all men would know that we were God's children.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And as he set out these two strands, both Calvinists and Charismatics
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   claimed him for themselves alone.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   But that was totally to misunderstand his teaching,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   that both strands were absolutely essential parts of Christian belief,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that the one called for the other, and that in the Christian life
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   they had to be woven strongly together in the same person.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Strength and warmth, warmth and strength, never one without the other.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Of course, in pulpit appearance, he looked the Calvinist rather than the Charismatic.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   In his austere Geneva gown, his lack of any personal reference,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   in his feeling that the awe of the Gospel forbade jokes,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   that the power of the message itself produced emotion enough,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   in his hatred of artificial bonhomie or breeziness,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   and in the sheer weight of the authority with which he preached,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   he was about as far from ecstasy or dance drama as you can get.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And yet, and yet he was the most human of men.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I remember one late autumn Sunday evening in the early fifties,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   sitting up at the back of the gallery there,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   through an hour's thundering sermon from this pulpit,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   quaking at the thought that at the end I was to go to see him
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   to ask for his elder daughter's hand in marriage.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I had rehearsed my lines most carefully.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   But when at last I crossed the threshold of the vestry,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   his welcome was so warm that as far as I remember I never had a chance to say a thing.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And for the next 28 years until he died, that warmth and that affection never diminished.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Not only in the family where he was deeply devoted to each and every one,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   but in the wider family of church and ministers,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   he was the most warm-hearted of men.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I have a constant picture of him sitting in his red-arm chair,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   engaged in long telephone conversations with ministers or others with problems.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   We would get a wave and a smile as we came.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Grandchildren would rush in in pyjamas to get a kiss on their way to bed,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and the call would go on as he quietly and gently
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   untangled the mental knots into which someone at the other end had tied themselves
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   or sympathized with someone in distress
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   or encouraged some minister faced with opposition.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And I know how it felt because he did the same with us.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And when he talked to you about your problems,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   he was thinking of you entirely, never remotely about himself.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   He not only had his undivided attention, but his total commitment
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   until the problem had been sorted out to his satisfaction and to yours.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   There were, of course, exceptions.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   His oldest grandson, age eight, at a quiet Tate R. Tate lunch
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   where both were quietly reading, looked at him suddenly and said,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   "What do you think about sex?"
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And history does not relate the answer to that particular query
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   from that eight-year-old grandson.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And he had in dealing with personal problems
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   both a vast range of knowledge, secular and spiritual,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and also an inspired common sense.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   There was a nurse in bed at her parents' house being looked after with a fellow nurse.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   She had a soaring temperature which came down to normal every time,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   every evening by the time the GP called round.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And no one could make any sense of the symptoms.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So Dr. Lloyd-Jones was called in and he looked at the nurse and heard about everything.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And then he got everyone out of the sick room and he asked the nurse,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   "Why did the hospital dismiss you?"
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   She hadn't dared tell her parents and had come home with a feigned illness
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and the other partner in trouble to report the high temperature when the doctor wasn't there.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And, of course, it always came down just before he arrived and they maintained her desperate cover.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And he had simply looked at the patient and not at the temperature chart
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and he knew with the doctor's eye that she wasn't ill.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   My recollection is that he prescribed to her in private a speedy recovery
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   followed by a dose of moral courage.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And, of course, he was very much in demand for problems on the frontiers of medicine
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and the Christian faith.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   A friend of mine was a depressive and his whole life was completely transformed
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   when the doctor was able to show him the sure foundation of faith on which he could build
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and from which he could fight the depressive doubts by which he had been continuously attacked.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   He was a new man from then on.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   He was not only generous with his time to people who had trouble and who came to him,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   he was generous with his money.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Of course, like all Cardiganshire Welsh, he was very careful with his money
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   but he hardly ever used it for himself.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   However small his ministerial salary, he always gave regularly and generously.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And whenever he found that he had more than he needed, whether from an inheritance
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   or laterally from book royalties, he at once started to ask who needed it
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   or who in the family needed it, who somewhere else needed it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I thought actually I had married a poor minister's daughter without expectations
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   but that was where we got our first loan to buy our first house.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Though the thought that he might spend any money on himself,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   it just never seemed to occur to him.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And he was just as generous with his grandchildren.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And while of course I've always regarded his views, as our generation did,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   with the greatest respect, not so his grandchildren.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   To them he was only de quay, which is the Welsh for granddad,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   and whatever views he held were there to be disputed,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   together with the views of the rest of their elders.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He was simply one of the elders and he was there to be argued with.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And when this went on, and it went on pretty vigorously,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   he was really like an old lion with young cubs
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   which darted in and out where no one else would dare to go
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and occasionally a great paw would descend upon them.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And he tolerated from them what he wouldn't have tolerated no doubt from anyone else.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And within the family debate, where he didn't have to worry about misrepresentation,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   he would set them off with the most outrageous statements.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And they came spluttering back, "You can't possibly say that!"
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And then he would defend this absurd position with all his forensic skill.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   We used to have tremendous discussions in the family about politics.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And although he had, throughout his public life,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   attacked the idea of a social gospel, the idea that there is some salvation through politics,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and as a kind of overrun from that, tended to the view that there was no Christian attitude to politics,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   he was nevertheless fascinated by the whole political process.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   He used to watch political debate on television with enormous zest
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and report to us on the programs that we had missed.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   He always wanted to know about the politicians we had met,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and he met quite a number himself.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   He and Mrs. Lloyd-Jones had a wedding present from Lloyd George,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   whom Doctor used to admire greatly,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and who indeed came to hear him speak at least once in Westminster Chapel.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   He had spoken here, I think, also on a platform with Stafford Cripps at an outside meeting.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Ernest Marples once gave him a very right-wing political book, which he passed on to me.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And of course, he knew many of the Welsh politicians particularly well.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Fledwyn Hughes, George Thomas, the present Speaker of the House of Commons,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   who had a great admiration for him.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And almost certainly it was George Thomas who recommended him for a high public honour,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   which as a Christian minister he felt bound to refuse.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And not only in Wales, I met Lord Mackie, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, ten days ago,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   and he said that he'd seen we were to have this meeting here tonight.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   So there was a wide interest in political circles in what he did,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and he had a wide interest in political circles.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I think what interested him in politics really was the clash of personality.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   For him, politics was people.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He didn't believe that there was a particularly Christian view of politics.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   It was more, to him, a matter of the capacity to make the right judgment.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And of course, Lloyd George's private life didn't override his capacity to make better political judgments
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   than others who didn't have his political genius.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And what he did object to was the hypocrisy of politicians disregarding their marriage vows
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   and then taking a high moral tone about the sanctity of contracts.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It was his capacity to be interested in everything that was going on
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   that gave him such a breadth of mind.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   He read the newspapers right till the end of his long illness.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Then one Thursday, he told Pam Harris to cancel the Times after Saturday, and he died on Sunday.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And he kept up his medical reading too, and his capacity for diagnosis,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   as we well learnt in our family, was as sharp as ever,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   something the specialists would overlook, he would be on to.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   But perhaps his greatest attribute was his visionary prophetic capacity.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   He saw, for instance, very early on, the potential of student work.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And all through the war, he was president and the inspiration of the InterVarsity Fellowship,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   working in a superb partnership with Dr. Douglas Johnson.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Together, they steered that movement away from muscular Christianity,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   the high-hearted, shallow evangelicalism of the day,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and they based it firmly on the rock of Christian truth and Christian doctrine.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Douglas Johnson's successor, Dr. Oliver Barclay, attended Westminster in the '50s,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and Dr. Robin Wells, the present General Secretary,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   was a member when he lived in London in the '60s.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So he kept that connection with the movement in Britain, with the student movement in Britain.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   And immediately after the war, he was one of the founders
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and Stacey Woods, who was the founder general secretary of that,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   was also founder general secretary of the American movement.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   IFES now has member movements from that beginning in 1946 in 75 countries,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and is a very flourishing and rapidly expanding movement,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   so that his vision of what could be done through student movements
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   in the world's universities, getting to the leaders in those countries,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   the leaders politically, the leaders in thought,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   so that they evangelized their own country,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   his inspiration there has now come to pass.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And he kept in touch with the IFES as well as the British movement.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   The last quadrennial general committee of the IFES he attended
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   was in Austria in 1971, where he gave a most magnificent address,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   which is one of the most memorable that he ever gave.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   He was there with another co-founder of IFES, John Bolton,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   a German-born American who had given us the old castle at Mittersill
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   for student conferences, which we still have.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And John Bolton was the sort of character that the doctor liked and got on with.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   He was the first treasurer of IFES.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   He was a tremendous character.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   He'd been a First World War officer in the Bavarian Army,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and after the war felt with other Bavarian officers
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   that the army had been let down by communists and socialists at home,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   that the Versailles Treaty had to be revised,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   and they felt they needed a popular politician to put this,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   because they were army officers and didn't know how to put it over to the public.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So they went out and found a good, rabble-rousing politician
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   calling himself Adolf Hitler.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   It wasn't long before they wanted to drop him.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And then they discovered he was not the sort of person who took to being dropped.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   And John Bolton, after discovering his family on one of the first of Hitler's hit lists,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   emigrated to America where he became a Christian,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   a fine Christian, and incidentally made a fortune.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And Martin Lloyd-Jones, John Bolton, Stacy Woods, the Australian,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   René Pache, the Swiss, all of these were tremendous characters with others.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   They were lifelong friends who respected, trusted, encouraged,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   criticised each other, a group of pioneers who separately and together
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   did great things for God through the international student movement.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And though less well known than his work in Britain,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I'm not so sure that this international work may well be far more reaching
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   in the end than anything he's actually done here.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   When he retired, he had 13 busy years in writing, in preaching,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and after much urging, television.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   He'd been very dismissive of television.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   I used to do a lot of television at the time and he never thought much of it.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   He was arguing that it was in one ear and out the other,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and that the real media of communication was still preaching and writing.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   But eventually he succumbed. He was persuaded.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   First in Wales, I think it was because it was in Wales he was persuaded,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and then occasionally on nationally networked programs.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   He did one series on Whitfield, taking his TV camera team around the country with him
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and he took to it just like a professional.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And he had no fear of famous TV interviewers.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Joan Bakewell, known as the intelligent man's pinup,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   was enormously impressed by his complete indifference to trendy thinking,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   to which most clerics that she interviewed seemed to want to bow.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   She said he was the first person to tell her frankly that she wasn't a Christian.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   She knew perfectly well she wasn't a Christian.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   She kept on telling them she wasn't a Christian,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and that his TV clergyman had insisted to her fury that she was really.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   But what she said was that she couldn't understand how in this day and age
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   he got anyone to listen to such old-fashioned ideas,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   much though she respected him for holding them.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   "Tell me," replied the doctor, "of any politician who in this day and age
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   can still fill the free trade hall in Manchester."
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And to that there was no answer. He could and they couldn't.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   If there is any one quality by which I remember him, it is his gentleness.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   He was a strong character.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   He had strong views and he could put them most powerfully.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   He had a formidable personality and the capacity, if he wished it, to crush opponents.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Yet to all in need, to all who wanted him, certainly to all in the family circle,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   he was the gentlest of people, always helpful,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   most anxious not to be in the way or to put anyone out,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   sitting peacefully in the armchair of our old house in Cambridgeshire,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   correcting manuscripts, reading a book while TV was on,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   while everyone flew in and out, talking their heads off,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and nothing disturbed him.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And last thing at night, he would have prayers, we would have prayers.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Someone would fetch his Bible, everyone would stop what they were doing,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   they would come in, they would start chatting.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   This would go on for maybe a full half hour or more
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   and he would join in while the Bible lay on his lap
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and then he would read a passage and then he would pray to the Heavenly Father
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   he knew so well, he trusted so completely, and he loved so dearly.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And that is how I today like to remember him.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
