[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.320]   Today is an Ask Me Anything, or AMA, episode.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.360]   But before I get to answering
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.220]   your most frequently asked questions,
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.520]   I'd like to make an exciting announcement.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   As you may know, being a subscriber
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.400]   to the Huberman Lab Premium Channel
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.720]   allows you access to the full-length AMAs.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.240]   Otherwise, you can just listen
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.740]   to the first 15 or 20 minutes or so of these AMAs.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.720]   Now, you may also know that a significant portion
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.640]   of the proceeds from the Premium Channel
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.300]   go to fund important research on humans
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.440]   to benefit mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840]   When we started the Premium Channel,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.760]   we had a one-for-one match with Tiny Foundation,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.600]   and that's great.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.840]   That means for every dollar
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.280]   that Huberman Lab Premium Channel contributes to research,
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.600]   Tiny Foundation matches that dollar amount.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.040]   And I'm very excited to announce
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.360]   that we now have a three-to-one dollar match
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.440]   with the Huberman Lab Premium Channel philanthropy.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.480]   That means for every dollar
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.160]   that we would contribute to research,
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.440]   three more dollars are matched to that dollar.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.720]   That's a 4X amplification of the funding
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.640]   to benefit important studies, again, on human beings
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.720]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.140]   And of course, as those studies are completed and published,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.400]   we will be sharing with you the information
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.180]   and how it can benefit all of you.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.600]   So for those of you that are already
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.480]   Huberman Lab Premium Channel subscribers, thank you.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.820]   And for those of you that are considering

[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.160]   and determine whether or not
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.720]   becoming a Premium subscriber is for you.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.960]   So without further ado,
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.320]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.140]   The first question is about scheduling fitness.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.080]   That is, how to ensure that you get sufficient number
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   of resistance training and cardiovascular workouts per week
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.000]   in order to best benefit your immediate and long-term health?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.420]   Now, I did an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.260]   all about what I call a foundational fitness protocol.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.700]   The foundational fitness protocol
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.220]   is the one that I've followed more or less
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.520]   for the last 30-plus years.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   And it certainly is not the only protocol
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.000]   that works out there,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.680]   but it's a schedule that most people can adhere to over time
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.400]   and that checks off the boxes
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.900]   for what the current research tells us we need
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.540]   in order to maximize our cardiovascular health,
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.600]   to maximize our neuromuscular health,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.680]   and to do so with a minimal time commitment.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.880]   Now, I've already put together,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.140]   and I provide a link in the show note captions
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.360]   for the foundational fitness protocol in the form of a PDF,
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.120]   which spells out which workouts are done on which days,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   what the various workouts look like,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.680]   including sets and reps,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.400]   what options you have in terms of cardiovascular exercise.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.140]   I personally like to run, but you could also use a rower.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.700]   You can use a stationary bike.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.240]   There's a lot of optionality
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.940]   inside of the foundational fitness protocol.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.180]   And by the way, the foundational fitness protocol
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.740]   is available to all of you, completely zero cost.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.700]   You don't even need to sign up
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.020]   for our neural network newsletter,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.180]   although you can if you like.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.280]   And again, you can find that
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.140]   by following a link in the show note captions
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.140]   or simply going to hubermanlab.com,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.620]   going to the menu tab, scrolling down to newsletter,
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.740]   and then you can scroll down
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.140]   to the foundational fitness protocol.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.540]   You can view it online, print it out.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.860]   Again, doesn't cost anything,
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.900]   and there's no barrier to entry,
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.740]   meaning you don't need to do anything to access it.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.480]   You can just look at it or download it
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.180]   or print it, whatever you like.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.440]   The basic structure of the foundational fitness protocol
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.360]   is three resistance training sessions per week
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.940]   and three cardiovascular training sessions per week,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.080]   and then one complete rest day.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.160]   Now that might sound like a lot to some of you,
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.680]   but in fact, none of the workouts is particularly long.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.960]   I think the longest workout
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.560]   in that entire foundational fitness protocol
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.920]   is about 60 minutes, maybe 75 minutes,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.440]   if you're moving slowly through the gym
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.140]   because somebody else is in the way
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.540]   or because you're checking your phone a little too often,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.080]   as we all sometimes do, that sort of thing.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.220]   But the basic structure is as follows.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.160]   For me, the foundational fitness protocol
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.800]   starts as day one on Monday,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.560]   but you could start it as day one
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.440]   on any day of the week, frankly.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.000]   So day one for me is to train legs.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   So that's quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.700]   and tibialis work, the front of the shin.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.200]   For those of you that don't know,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.940]   I'm a big fan of doing tibialis work.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.280]   Then the next day is a complete day off
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.480]   during which you could do, if you wanted,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.660]   something like deliberate heat
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.340]   or deliberate cold exposure or both, but you don't have to.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.900]   It's just nice to have a complete day off
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.420]   after training legs because if you train legs properly,
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.740]   oftentimes it can be a bit tiring
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.460]   and the next day you're recovering.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.660]   Then the following day is either
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.200]   a cardiovascular training session
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.860]   of about 20 to 30 minutes of, say,
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.620]   a jog at a slightly more rapid clip
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.540]   than one would consider zone two cardio.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.900]   Zone two cardio is where you can carry out a conversation,
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.500]   so a little bit faster than that.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.080]   Or if you're not feeling like your legs
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.560]   are recovered enough to do that,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   you could do the resistance training work on that day.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.280]   The resistance training work
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.840]   that falls in the middle of the week is,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.280]   believe it or not, torso.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.480]   I know that for some of you
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.280]   that are into more kind of bodybuilding type routines,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.680]   training your entire torso on one day
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.600]   might seem like a lot,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.000]   but really that day just involves some pushing,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.520]   so some overhead shoulder press type workouts or dips,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.260]   maybe some bench presses if that's your thing,
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.220]   as well as some pulling,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.460]   so some rows and some pull-ups or chin-ups,
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.280]   things of that sort, again, all tailored to you
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.440]   so that you're not doing anything
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.400]   that aggravates any preexisting injuries,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.420]   and you're not going to do anything
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.360]   that's going to induce injuries, okay?
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.760]   So there's some pushing and pulling,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.000]   maybe a little bit of neck work
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.160]   if you need some additional neck strength,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.200]   that sort of thing.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.620]   So with legs on Monday, rest on Tuesday,
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.240]   that falls either on Wednesday or Thursday,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.160]   depending on how recovered your legs were.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.000]   Then the next day,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.080]   which for me typically falls on a Friday,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.520]   is a high-intensity interval training session,
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.400]   although really it's just about VO2 max.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.540]   It's about getting maximum heart rate
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.880]   where you're breathing really, really hard,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.160]   and that's a very short workout.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.860]   The total duration of that workout
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.800]   is anywhere from eight to 15 minutes total.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   So for me, it involves getting on an Airdyne bike.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.600]   Those are those bikes with some resistance
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.420]   'cause there's a fan,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.520]   although you could do this on a rower,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.220]   basically anything where you can exert yourself
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.400]   to get your heart rate way, way up
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.460]   and breathe very, very hard,
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.800]   where you're not going to injure
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.620]   your musculoskeletal system.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.400]   You're not gonna do any soft tissue damage.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.080]   So you need to figure out what that is for you.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.360]   Again, the PDF explains how to select that.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.080]   For me, it typically means getting on the Airdyne bike
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.140]   and pedaling very hard for about 20 seconds,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.680]   then resting 10 seconds, 20 seconds hard,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.960]   10 seconds rest, 20 seconds hard,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.200]   for a total of about eight cycles,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.120]   by the end of which I'm breathing extremely hard,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.400]   my heart rate is way, way up,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.680]   and then I'll just shower and head about my day.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.820]   And then the following day,
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.800]   which typically for me falls on a Saturday,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   although again, we're gonna talk about flexibility
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   and how to build flexibility into the schedule.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.980]   The Saturday workout is typically things
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.000]   like biceps, triceps, some calves,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.320]   maybe a bit more neck work
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.680]   and some abdominal work, excuse me.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.400]   So basically small body parts
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.280]   that can recover pretty quickly.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.240]   And that workout typically takes only about 45 to 50 minutes,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.120]   maybe 60 minutes maximum.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.100]   And then the following day, which is of course Sunday,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.840]   is a day in which I try and get outside
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.960]   and move as much as possible.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.720]   So I'll typically do the longer Sunday cardio workout
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.440]   as either a ruck, so a backpack with a weight in it.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.040]   By the way, if you don't own a rucksack,
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.900]   you can just put a gallon water jug in there full,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.220]   and then drink it as you go, it'll lighten as you go.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.680]   Or you could get a weight vest
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.700]   if you have the resources to do that.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.480]   There's some great weight vests out there,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.500]   a varying weight.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.160]   You can throw a kid on your shoulders.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.020]   If you got a kid that wants to be carried on your shoulders,
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.260]   you can do it alone, listening to an audio book,
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.380]   listening to music or in total silence.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.400]   I've done all these various versions, by the way.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.440]   You can do it with family members or with friends.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.540]   I'll sometimes do this with my significant other.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.840]   One of the great things about this long Sunday workout
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.260]   is that it's extremely flexible
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.380]   in terms of how social you are
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.580]   or whether or not you do it in isolation,
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.380]   whether or not you do it on concrete or on dirt,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.760]   it's very versatile.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.160]   For instance, if I have friends over
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.960]   and I want to spend time with them,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.860]   but I also want to get outdoors and do this workout.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.780]   And if they're interested
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.060]   in getting some outdoor movement as well,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.300]   we'll all just head out for a hike.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.000]   And if they are less fit than I am
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.300]   or intend to move more slowly,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.540]   well then I'll throw on a 10 or 15,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.800]   maybe even 30 pound backpack
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.500]   so that I get a good workout out of it.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.860]   And if they're faster than I am,
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.420]   and they're the sort of person who is a triathlete,
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.740]   I've got some friends who are triathletes
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.220]   and they want to move at a really fast clip,
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.660]   well then I'm not bringing any weight pack
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.260]   and I'm just going to ask them to weight up for me
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.780]   because I'm going to have a hard time keeping up,
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.080]   but I'll have to really push myself as I go along.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.180]   So a lot of versatility.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.820]   I don't measure my heart rate
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.340]   during any of these workouts, by the way,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.140]   that's not my preferred way to do things.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.100]   I know other people like to measure heart rate as they go.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.000]   I find it's just really nice to get out once a week,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.260]   if possible, out of doors
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.220]   and just move my body as much as possible
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.460]   so that I head into the week
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.000]   knowing that I got some really terrific outdoor time
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.760]   in nature while benefiting my cardiovascular system
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.180]   and often while socializing
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.060]   with important people in my life as well.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.140]   Okay, so that's the summary
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.820]   of the foundational fitness protocol.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.420]   And one thing that I really like about it
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.180]   is that the total time commitment is actually not that great.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.060]   If you step back from it,
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.100]   you realize there's a brief 12 minute workout,
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.020]   there's an hour long weight training workout,
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.640]   there's a long hike, sure,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.900]   but then there's a 20 minute jog.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.260]   It's really not that much time
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.740]   when you consider the overall benefits to one's health.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.500]   Now, one very important feature
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.220]   of the foundational fitness protocol
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.540]   is to build some flexibility into it.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.580]   You know, the way I described it up until now was,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.380]   okay, Monday legs, Tuesday rest,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.980]   Wednesday cardio, Thursday torso,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.220]   Friday high-intensity interval training VO2 max,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.460]   Saturday, small body parts, biceps, triceps,
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.040]   calves, et cetera, Sunday, long, slow distance cardio.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.720]   But in reality, sometimes I have to travel on a Monday.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.340]   So I don't have the option to train legs that day.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.380]   In which case, what I will do
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.340]   is either slide that workout to Sunday,
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.880]   meaning I'm doing both long, slow distance cardio
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.260]   and the leg workout, or I'll slide it to Tuesday,
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.000]   which is typically a rest day.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.460]   However, sometimes I'm traveling on a Monday.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.220]   I don't have access to a gym to train my legs properly.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.060]   So what do I do?
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.060]   Do I skip leg day?
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.780]   No, I don't skip leg day typically,
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.500]   unless I'm sick or I'm extremely sleep deprived
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.240]   or there's some other major stress in my life.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.740]   What I'll typically do is I will plan for it
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.460]   by training my legs on Sunday.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.280]   Or if I don't have access to a place
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.460]   where I can train my legs properly on Sunday,
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.700]   I'll just shift it to Tuesday.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.080]   Okay, now the question always becomes,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.180]   if I were to move that leg workout to Sunday,
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.180]   just by way of necessity,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.660]   because I'm traveling on a Monday,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.880]   do I also do the long, slow distance work
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.380]   that I typically do on Sunday?
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.100]   And the answer is yes, if I'm well-rested.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.740]   So if I'm well-rested and well-fed,
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.260]   I'm not feeling like I'm fighting off any kind of illness
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.100]   and I have the time,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.620]   what I'll do is I'll train my legs in the gym on Sunday,
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.140]   and then I'll head out for, I don't know,
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.240]   an hour long walk in the neighborhood
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.080]   or something like that.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   So I'm probably not training my legs hard
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.420]   and then going hiking hard all day,
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.780]   although I've done that before,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.100]   but then I'm sure to rest completely the next day,
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.340]   which is Monday.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.060]   Now, what if I move the leg workout to Tuesday,
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.700]   do then I take Wednesday off completely?
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.780]   Well, for me, the way I train legs
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.560]   is typically with a lot of intensity.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.340]   So if I'm going to train legs,
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.500]   typically the next day will be a complete day off,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.780]   no matter what, but that's not always the case.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.300]   I think as long as you're not moving your workouts
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.380]   around constantly,
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.400]   it's perfectly fine to train your legs really hard
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.780]   on a Tuesday because you have to,
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.100]   because you couldn't train them on Monday.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.020]   And then on Wednesday, rather than go out for a jog,
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.780]   I might train torso and I might back off
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.420]   on the intensity a little bit,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.580]   and then I'll take a day off.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.140]   I will say that anytime I do resistance training workouts
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.380]   two days in a row,
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.900]   I make sure that I take a complete day off
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.540]   the following third day, just for sake of recovery.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.980]   I'm not somebody that recovers particularly well
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.740]   from any form of exercise.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.020]   I find that if I train longer than 90 minutes,
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.500]   especially with resistance training,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.860]   if I crank up the intensity too much,
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.980]   I tend to get sick or I tend to stop making progress
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.900]   with my resistance training sessions.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.660]   So the basic takeaway here is,
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.340]   it's perfectly fine to slide a resistance training session,
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.500]   such as legs, forward a day or back a day.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.220]   Okay, so I guess back a day would be from Monday to Sunday
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.860]   or forward from Monday to Tuesday.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.180]   But then you're going to want to make some adjustments
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.420]   accordingly so that you don't get sick
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.720]   or you don't overtrain and that sort of thing.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.480]   Now, let's say that I train my legs on Tuesday,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.500]   then I do torso work on Wednesday,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.380]   and then I take the next day completely off.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.380]   So I take Thursday completely off.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.620]   Well, then Friday rolls around
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.300]   and I haven't done any cardiovascular training that week,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.360]   except for the walk that I did on Sunday.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.540]   What am I going to do?
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.820]   Do I do my VO2 max and a 30 minute jog?
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.780]   Sure, that's what I would do.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.060]   I would combine the two cardiovascular workouts
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.380]   that I normally do in the middle of the week
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.000]   by for instance, going out for a 20 or 30 minute jog.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.220]   And then at the end, doing some VO2 max work
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.880]   such that by the end of Friday,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.460]   I'm caught up with that cardiovascular training.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.860]   And then on Saturday, I would just go right ahead
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.540]   and do those small body parts training.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.140]   And then on Sunday, I would take a hike
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.420]   and that sort of thing.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.460]   So basically what I'm saying
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.180]   is that foundational fitness protocol
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.380]   provides a scaffold of ideal,
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.860]   what you would do if you had a completely
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.060]   non-negotiable mindset where you said,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.420]   okay, Monday's always legs.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.540]   Wednesday is always this, Thursday is always that.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.900]   So basically what I'm describing
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.860]   is trying to achieve optimal, right?
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.340]   Training certain things on certain days,
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.960]   doing certain things in certain ways.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.480]   That wasn't meant to rhyme by the way.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.320]   But the reality is we all have travel,
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   we all get run down, we all have lack of sleep at times,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.040]   we have stressful episodes in life.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.960]   So for me, the best solution to that
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.800]   is to basically allow any one workout,
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.320]   either resistance training or cardiovascular workout
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.160]   to slide back or forward by one day,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.200]   which means sometimes doubling up on workouts
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.560]   for a given day to make sure that I check off those boxes
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.920]   of getting three resistance training sessions per week
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.680]   and three cardiovascular training sessions per week.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.820]   Again, for the cardiovascular training sessions,
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.000]   it's a long, slow distance,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.120]   it's a moderate 20 or 30 minute
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.460]   cardiovascular training session.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.100]   And then it's that shorter VO2 max
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.360]   cardiovascular training session.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.640]   And sometimes doubling those up on the same day
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.000]   so that I make sure that by the end of the week,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.720]   I've achieved what I want to achieve,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.640]   which is I've trained my legs, I've trained my torso,
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.720]   I've trained my arms,
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.640]   any small body parts that need additional work
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.120]   for balance or stabilization or aesthetic reasons,
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.040]   you get that in,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.680]   but also that you get the base
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.600]   of the long, slow distance endurance,
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.800]   you get the slightly more intense
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.160]   or rather faster cardiovascular training session,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.400]   and then you get your heart rate up, up, up
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.840]   at least once per week
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.160]   doing that high intensity interval training.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.280]   Now, as I describe all this,
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.020]   I realized that I might be taking what a few minutes ago
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.600]   was fairly simple in design and making it more complex.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.440]   Why?
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.600]   Well, some people feel that
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.760]   as soon as you introduce flexibility into a schedule,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.480]   you remove, of course, the non-negotiable aspect of it.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.040]   And then people get really confused.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.900]   Are they over-training?
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.740]   Are they under-training?
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.200]   Is it okay, for instance,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   if you can't train Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.760]   to then just train Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday?
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.440]   I think everybody is an individual.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.760]   Everybody needs to modify their schedule
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.600]   according to the demands on their life
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.320]   and their particular fitness needs.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.160]   But I will say this,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.560]   I've found having tried
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.420]   many, many different fitness schedules,
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.960]   many, many different combinations of resistance training
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.480]   and cardiovascular training,
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.860]   that the best solution is to find what you can do
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.000]   on a consistent basis,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.180]   and to try and do that as many days and weeks
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.520]   of the year as possible,
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.900]   with the understanding that sometimes
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.880]   you're simply not going to be able to meet that schedule,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.600]   which is why you allow for this sliding back and forward
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.540]   of individual workouts,
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.620]   doubling up occasionally to workouts per day
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.000]   in order to stay on schedule.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.100]   But, and this is very important,
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.040]   also allowing yourself to sometimes
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.600]   just skip a training day.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.440]   Yes, I said it,
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.120]   to sometimes just skip a training day.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.480]   You're feeling a little rundown,
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.320]   it's late in the day,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.620]   you don't want to drink caffeine to train
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.580]   because then it's going to throw off your sleep.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.880]   Well, I'm the first person to say,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.800]   you know, skip torso training day,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.840]   and then maybe on small body parts day,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.680]   which for me falls on Saturday,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.380]   instead of just doing biceps triceps
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.960]   with some isolation exercises,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.100]   make sure you do a few chins, pull-ups, dips,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.940]   and things like that
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.160]   to make sure that you hit those torso muscles as well.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.080]   Skipping a workout every once in a while
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.720]   is not going to crater your entire fitness program.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.800]   It's simply not.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.080]   That said, for sake of physical health
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.720]   and for sake of just feeling good
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.200]   about your commitment and follow-through
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.840]   to your fitness regimen,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.020]   you should try on average
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.560]   to make somewhere between 85 and 95% of your workouts.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.400]   And if you schedule things well,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.320]   and in particular, if you leave your phone out of the gym,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   if you're able to do that,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.560]   I know sometimes we need the phone
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.640]   to communicate with people
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.280]   or the potential to communicate with people
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.680]   if people need to get ahold of us.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.980]   But if you can leave your phone outside of the gym,
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.320]   you'll be amazed at how quickly
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.520]   you move through these workouts.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.200]   Likewise, with your cardiovascular training sessions.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.760]   Now, one important feature of flexibility
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.320]   that I haven't talked about yet
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.480]   is flexibility within a day.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.880]   So for me, just personally,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.440]   again, this is my personal preference.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.680]   This is by no means dogma.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.380]   I prefer to get my workouts done first thing in the morning.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.480]   So I like to get up, hydrate,
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.180]   get some electrolytes in my system,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.420]   get some caffeine in my system if I'm going to work out.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.560]   That's right, I said it.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.940]   I do believe if you experience a crash in energy
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.120]   in the afternoon, delaying your caffeine
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.040]   by about 90 minutes or so after waking
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.080]   can be very beneficial.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.460]   I know there's some controversy around that,
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.080]   but almost everybody that tries it
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.560]   finds that that's the case.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.000]   Again, no obligation to do that.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.560]   It's just a suggestion to perhaps experiment with
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.200]   if you have an afternoon crash.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.000]   But for me, and I think for most people,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.440]   if you're going to work out first thing in the morning
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.200]   and you like caffeine before a workout,
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.840]   drink caffeine first thing in the morning.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.660]   That's certainly what I do
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.120]   if I'm going to work out that day.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.160]   I like to have my workouts done before 9 a.m.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   and ideally before 8.30 a.m.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.220]   so that I can move into my work day.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.080]   However, there are days where that simply doesn't happen.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.280]   And then the question is,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.880]   is it okay to move a workout from its typical time,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.320]   like for me, 7.30 a.m. or so to the afternoon?
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.260]   And the answer is yes.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.040]   There's simply no reason why that's not okay.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.520]   It's not going to cause a significant diminishment
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.360]   in performance.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.260]   If anything, the data point to the fact that
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.020]   for sake of physical performance and output,
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.980]   workouts in the afternoon are probably more beneficial.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.100]   I don't know about that result.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.740]   I mean, that's certainly what the data say.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.720]   I know for me, I'm most alert
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.040]   and have the most amount of energy
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.880]   first thing in the morning.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   And so that's when my workouts tend to be best.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.300]   But if I can't make a workout in the morning,
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.740]   I'll sometimes do it in the afternoon
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.160]   around two or 3 p.m.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.260]   Making sure, however,
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.700]   that I don't consume so much caffeine before that workout
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.560]   that it's going to disrupt my sleep.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.480]   Now there's another feature of training,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.440]   which is like sunlight, like meals, like socialization,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.840]   physical exercise provides an entrainment mechanism.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.320]   That is a predictive mechanism
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.400]   for your so-called autonomic nervous system
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.760]   that makes it such that at a given hour of the day
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.880]   that you normally train,
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.980]   so for me around 7.30 a.m. or so,
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.800]   you'll notice that there's going to be a peak
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.440]   in physical and mental energy.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.280]   That's right.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.480]   If you work out at a given time pretty consistently,
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.680]   your autonomic nervous system
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.000]   will start to anticipate that timing
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.820]   and you'll start to feel an increase in energy
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.980]   around that time.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.280]   That is not an imagined thing.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.120]   It's a real thing.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.440]   It's a short-term entrainment, as we call it.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.720]   This is something that I'll probably visit
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.940]   in a future full-length episode
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.480]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.680]   But what you'll notice is that around the time
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.280]   that you normally train or run or whatever you want to call
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.800]   it, you start to feel an increase in energy.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.960]   And you can leverage that by going ahead and training.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.820]   But if you don't have the opportunity to train,
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.560]   then I do think it's a good idea
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.900]   to still get that training session in
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.160]   at a later time during the day,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.480]   if you have the opportunity.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.220]   Otherwise you may have to slide it to the day before
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.100]   or the day after, as we talked about a few minutes ago,
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.840]   or you may have to skip entirely.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.580]   The point here is that it's always going to be best
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.700]   to complete the workout if you can complete the workout
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.280]   safely and without disrupting your nighttime sleep.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.020]   I think that's really the biggest takeaway.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.140]   I personally am not going to compromise sleep
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.940]   and my overall health in order to get workouts in.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.860]   Every once in a while,
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.300]   I'll force myself to wake up especially early,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.460]   meaning I'll cash out a couple hours of sleep
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.660]   that I would normally get.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.300]   So I'll normally get up around, I don't know,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.880]   6 a.m. or 6.30, kind of depends on when I went to sleep,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.020]   but sometimes I'll give up two hours of sleep
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.180]   to get a workout in in the morning
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.300]   if I'm going to fly that day.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.380]   I will sometimes do that.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.780]   However, if I'm very fatigued,
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.180]   if I've been exposed to colds and flus,
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.780]   I'm feeling kind of rundown, then I won't do that.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.100]   I'll prioritize sleep.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.900]   Most of the time I prioritize sleep,
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.260]   but there are those occasions
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.980]   in which I'll prioritize the workout.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.460]   Each and all of us have those options.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.180]   And my suggestion is to really look at things
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.740]   on a case-by-case, meaning you as an individual
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.020]   and on a daily basis, taking into account
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.100]   what happened the day before, how stressed you are,
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.140]   how much sleep you're getting,
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.260]   how much exposure to colds and flus,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.440]   and to pay attention to how hard
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.460]   you've been training recently.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.900]   You know, if you're on a family vacation
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.420]   and you want more time with family,
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.860]   are you really going to compromise time with family
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.420]   in order to get your workouts in?
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.540]   I think that would be probably a bad idea.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.360]   You know, if I'm honest,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.660]   I think you want to prioritize social life.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.180]   That's super important.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.780]   But then of course you don't want to prioritize social life
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.340]   to the detriment of your physical health.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.860]   So it's all a bit of give and take.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.840]   And what I've tried to describe here is again,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.660]   a recap of the foundational fitness protocol,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.060]   the places where there's some flexibility,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.180]   you can move workouts back a day or forward a day.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.700]   If you like, you could double up if you like,
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.100]   especially if you're getting great rest
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.660]   and you're well-fed, et cetera.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.340]   And you can also move the workout up or down in the day,
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.380]   depending on how much energy you have,
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.780]   how much sleep you've gotten.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.380]   And of course, how, you know, rigid you are with yourself.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.860]   Some people are just really rigid.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.820]   They are completely in the non-negotiable stance.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.780]   They get their workout in no matter what,
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.580]   because they feel as if they don't,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.580]   then they're going to be grumpy
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.700]   or they're going to fall off schedule.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.700]   Other people like me try to get the workouts done.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.220]   I would say anywhere from 85 to 95% of the time,
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.660]   I get those workouts done occasionally.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.040]   I skip them typically because life stress, travel,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.240]   or some sort of low-grade illness, you know,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.980]   a cold or a flu or something of that sort.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.460]   I get those pretty rarely, but they do happen.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.180]   So that's really how I answer this question
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.380]   of how to build flexibility into one's fitness schedule.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.940]   I should also mention that I'm a big believer
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.200]   in periodization.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.820]   So I will do four month blocks of training heavier
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.660]   with the weights.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.020]   So that's in the three to five repetition range.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.140]   Then another three to four month block will follow
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.940]   where I'm training slightly less heavy.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.900]   So I'll typically be using anywhere
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.900]   from five to eight repetition range.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.780]   And then for the next four month block,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.500]   I'll be using somewhere between eight
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.180]   and 15 repetition range.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.020]   Every once in a while, I'll mix it up so that, you know,
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.120]   if I've been training heavy a lot,
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.140]   I might do a lighter workout.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.020]   Or if I've been training lighter,
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.020]   I might do a heavy workout.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.560]   Again, not super rigid.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.580]   I personally find that by being strict and rigid
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.380]   about the scheduling, about the reps and the sets, et cetera,
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.460]   for most of the time,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.420]   meaning about 85 to 95% of workouts and across the year,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.720]   that things just work out great.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.260]   You'll make constant progress
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.960]   without having to drive yourself and everybody else crazy
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.500]   with extreme rigidity and compulsivity around training.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.560]   And then of course you can enjoy those days off.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.260]   You can enjoy the flexibility in your schedule
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.840]   because yes, physical fitness is wonderful,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.860]   but unless you're an athlete,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.200]   especially a professional athlete,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.340]   really physical fitness is about being able to lean
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.700]   into other aspects of life with more vigor.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.100]   At least that's what it's about for me.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.500]   And I think that's what it's about for most people.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.060]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.000]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.380]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.980]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.240]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.500]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Channel
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.460]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.600]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.800]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.020]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.880]   It's really twofold.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.800]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.280]   for the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.560]   which of course will still be continued
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.000]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.420]   We are not going to change the format
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.000]   or anything about the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.440]   and to fund research,
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.480]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.540]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.340]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.540]   that we are most interested in.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.540]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.160]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.220]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.000]   And those protocols will be distributed through all channels,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.280]   not just the Premium Channel, but through all channels,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.540]   Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.100]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.300]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.500]   and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.180]   that provides those kinds of answers in the first place.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.020]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.800]   for the Huberman Lab Premium Channel,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.860]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.620]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.960]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.860]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.420]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.820]   that other people ask as well.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.760]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.540]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.460]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.700]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.020]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.380]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.780]   You can sign up for the Premium Channel
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.460]   by going to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.340]   Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.240]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
