[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   What's amazing about this model, this model on its own has rendered physics.
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.700]   If you look at some of the other demos on this tool, you can
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.160]   actually see fluid moving.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.300]   Those are like physics models that would typically be deterministically
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.480]   written, meaning that a programmer, an engineer writes the physics, and
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.560]   then the unreal engine renders the physics.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.960]   In this case, the model figured out the physics and the model probably
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.180]   did it in such a reduced way that you could use a reduced amount of
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.500]   compute to generate something that would otherwise take a ton of compute time.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.520]   And I think it really speaks to what's so incredible right now, which is
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.440]   that software is writing itself, and it's replacing a lot of human determinism.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.640]   The way that humans think about constructing software is being
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640]   completely redone with these learn models.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.440]   This is incredible because Pixar spent years, maybe a decade
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.920]   trying to figure out hair.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.960]   I remember talking to Ed Catmull and he told me hair was just so hard
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.240]   to get right with wind and lighting.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.720]   They literally built the physics engine for years to make hair
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.040]   across the uncanny valley.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.760]   What you're saying here, Friedberg, is somehow this language model,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   this image model just outputs it.
