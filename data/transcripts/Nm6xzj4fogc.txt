[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   [Music]
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.680]   Each day we are awakened to the harsh reality of violence in this world.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.400]   On the news we see the consequences of palpable evil in this world that is undeniable.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   The global bloodshed is horrific and often hard to bear.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   It causes us to rise up in seeking justice and this proves that objective evil exists.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.700]   It's real.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.300]   As John Piper showed in his recent sermon.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.700]   I want to ask why do we have a world like this?
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.000]   Why so much pain?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100]   Why so much conflict?
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.300]   Why so much suffering?
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.200]   Why so much death?
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.300]   It is a horrible place.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.000]   It is a conveyor belt of corpses.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.300]   Millions of people right now are weeping their eyes out over the sorrows in their lives as we speak.
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.500]   Now before I go to the Bible and try to give you pointers for you to think about.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   Let me tell you something that I think I found very shocking when I realized it.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:22.100]   God has ordained in his mercy that sometimes very unbelieving people wake up to his reality
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.200]   because of pain, not because of its absence.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.900]   For example, suppose you're a professor in a university
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.980]   and you've absorbed a postmodern mindset that playfully says,
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.940]   what's right for you is right for you.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.620]   And what's right for me is right for me.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.140]   And what's wrong for you is wrong for you.
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.200]   And what's wrong for me is wrong for me.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.700]   And we don't impose our morality on each other.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.900]   There is no one absolute right and wrong, good and bad,
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.460]   beautiful and ugly, that gets squashed down
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.860]   onto our own perceptions and preferences.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380]   That's just rampant, right?
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.860]   That's just rampant.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.540]   And it is playful.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.940]   And it is going to come to an end
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.040]   when that professor walks into a real living Holocaust himself.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.400]   So whatever the situation is, he walks
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.360]   into an experience of 6 million Jewish people murdered,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.960]   or 60 million under the Stalinist regime,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.880]   starved and killed in the gulags.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720]   Or we're celebrating 100 years this year
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.760]   since the Armenian genocide of the Turkish people,
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.520]   slaughtering a million and a half
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.800]   Armenians between Turkey and Syria in 1915.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.240]   You walk into that as a professor who's
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   been playing word games on tenure with students,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   fitting them to be destroyed by the world in which they live
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.720]   with this absolute nonsense.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.520]   That what's right for you is right for you.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.080]   What's wrong for me is wrong for me.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.520]   And suddenly, he is so confronted by an evil,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.640]   he finds welling up out of his heart a statement
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.000]   he thought would never come.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.360]   That is evil.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.760]   And suddenly, he realizes what he just said.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.400]   He does not mean, well, if you don't think it's evil,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.800]   you don't have to think it's evil.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.360]   You can think it's good.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200]   He has just woken up from a dream world, an academic dream
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.160]   world.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.700]   And he knows he has made a pronouncement
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.760]   of absolute significance.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.800]   That's evil.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.120]   That's evil.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.520]   And he knows, he's a professor.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.640]   He knows and he realizes, I have just broken every rule
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.880]   in my philosophy.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.640]   And I cannot deny what I am saying.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.040]   That's evil.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.680]   And I don't mean it's the result of chemical synapses popping
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   in my evolutionary primate brain.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.920]   I mean, it's real.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.360]   I mean, it has significance.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.720]   I mean, it is a moral reality.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.400]   It holds for everybody.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.160]   This is not part of what I was thinking.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.880]   This is evil.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.560]   And he knows pronouncements like that
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   are meaningless unless there's an absolute.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.560]   And where do they come from?
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.480]   They come from God or nowhere.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.360]   You live a life of meaninglessness.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.920]   You're a bag of chemicals and electrical impulses
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.320]   just moving in a kind of evolutionary movement of time
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.880]   and chance with no significance to your moral judgments
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.840]   whatsoever unless God is.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.520]   It happens.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.480]   In other words, it happens that in the myth of evil,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.000]   evil becomes the very moment and means by which a person can
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.720]   awaken to the fact that we're not playing games.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.520]   We're not just stuff.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.600]   It is a wonderful thing that God has mercy
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.240]   like that in the midst of such great evils.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.600]   Yes, that is sobering and glorious at the same time.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.160]   This clip was taken from John Piper's recent sermon,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.360]   The Pain of the World and the Purposes of God,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.920]   a sermon he preached in Vancouver on April 26.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.360]   You can find the full audio recording of the sermon
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.440]   at DesiringGod.org right now.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.880]   Video is also online as well.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.920]   And tomorrow, we're going to return with guest Paul Tripp.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.800]   We'll see you then.
