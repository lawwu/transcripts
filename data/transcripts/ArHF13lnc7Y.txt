[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   We're back with guest Paul David Tripp, the author of the book "Awe, Why It Matters
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.500]   for Everything We Think, Say, and Do," a book which easily made my top ten list for
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.840]   best books of 2015.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.940]   And this week we're talking about awe and how it really does relate to everything in
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.760]   life, specifically to our spiritual growth, our Bible intake, our ministry aims, and even
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.400]   our news consumption, our anxieties, our weight loss attempts, our parenting methods, and
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.460]   our expectations of marriage and romantic love.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.760]   And today we're going to talk about weight loss.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.080]   Paul, the physical side of weight loss is going to happen in a lot of different ways
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.200]   for various people, but there seems to be a common spiritual dimension to weight loss
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.920]   that we all need to be aware of.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.960]   And you mentioned your own weight loss journey briefly.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.840]   Share with us what you learned in the process.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.560]   You know, one of the things that I encountered in my own walk with God is how there are always
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.080]   areas of inconsistency that need to be addressed.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.960]   And one of those for me was my relationship to food.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.360]   I love how much of the glory of God in creation is edible.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   That's a sweet thing that God created a pleasurable world of food, but that pleasure of food is
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.400]   meant to be a finger that points me to God.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.660]   It's not meant to be the thing that satisfies my heart.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.540]   And so what was happening to me is, you know, if you gain a half a pound a month, you don't
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.600]   notice it, but that's six pounds a year, and in five years, you put on 30 pounds.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.320]   And that's all the result of the pleasure of food having too much control over the way
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.400]   you think about a good evening or a good day or a good week.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.800]   And so I've had to confess that, confess patterns of gluttony, and completely change my relationship
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.880]   to food to eat what I should eat for the maintenance of my physical body.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.360]   The result of that is the loss of about 40 pounds.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.080]   And for me, it was not about weight so much as, I mean, that was an issue, but living
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.440]   in a more appropriate way.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   - Yeah, so for a Christian who has tried diet fads, where do they start when it comes to
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   the spiritual questions?
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.760]   - Well, here's the thing we all need to face when it comes to weight and diet, that diets
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.000]   don't work.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.320]   One of the things that just makes me angry, I hope it's righteous anger, is this industry,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.360]   this billion dollar industry that's making promises to people that are not true.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.880]   Because diets don't address the cause of the gaining of weight.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.800]   And because they don't address the cause, they don't actually work.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   I mean, you can't starve yourself forever.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.940]   It's not healthy to eat packaged Franken food forever.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.180]   It's only when your heart is properly satisfied with God that you now have the power to say
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.280]   no to other things that would tempt you to go there for satisfaction.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.240]   - Thus we return to awe in God, which is what we talked about last time.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.040]   So gluttony emerged for you.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.240]   When did this root cause of weight gain confront you?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   When did you confront it?
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.240]   - You know, a couple of things.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.880]   It was initiated by the wedding of my son.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   I thought, you know, I've gained a lot of weight.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.640]   And I began to think about that.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:27.720]   And what really hit me was as I began to eat in a different way, how hungry I felt, how
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.760]   sort of impoverished I felt.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.840]   But I wasn't really hungry.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.080]   It was just that I was so used to loading my body with so many more calories than I
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.340]   actually needed.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.240]   And it was that going through that hunger that really alerted me to the fact that food
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.840]   had been too much present in my life.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.380]   And I'm not hungry anymore.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.040]   You would probably watch me throughout a day and you would think this man eats like a bird.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.280]   But I eat what I need to eat.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.680]   And I've, you know, kept my weight off for four years.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.320]   And there's just no going back because it's not just that I eat different things, but
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.680]   the lifestyle of my heart toward food has changed.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680]   Very good.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.960]   And we're going to return tomorrow and transition to talk about awe and how it really helps
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.240]   to simplify the aim of our ministry work, all of it.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.440]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with guest Paul Tripp.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.000]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.460]   you
