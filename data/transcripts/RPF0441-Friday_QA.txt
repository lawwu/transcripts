[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I am your host.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And today, this is kind of like a radio show.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   You got phone lines, you got callers,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and you got a host behind a microphone, so.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   A little bit of live Q&A today.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Right now I have two callers waiting on the line,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and so we'll see if anybody else calls in as we get started.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But it works just like a live call-in show for a radio.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And the way to get notified about these shows
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   is I've been doing these shows exclusively for patrons,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   patrons of the show, where I put it out on the Patreon page
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and I let patrons know that I,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   that we can call in and do a Friday Q&A show.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But the last two times that I put that out,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I have had zero, zero participation from patrons.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I guess all the patrons have all their questions answered
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   'cause I've done such a good job in other places, right?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So today I put it out to the email list,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and so I've got a couple of callers
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   who have called in on the email list.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So basically, and I've also in the past,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   in a previous one, when my Patreon participation was low,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I put this in the Radical Personal Finance
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Facebook community group.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So if you're not connected with me on the email list,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   and also if you're not connected
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook community,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   or if you're not a patron of the show,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   you're basically not getting any of these notifications.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   But if you're in those things, so from time to time,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   you might get something nice like this live Q&A show.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Quick note on the email list, by the way,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   one of my commitments was to do a better job with that,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and I utterly failed for a while.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But those of you who are subscribed to the email list
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   will notice and will have noticed that
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I've gotten better at that,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and that's my number one priority right now,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   is to do a good job communicating via email.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And so I'll be sharing a lot of personal stuff
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   through the email, I'll be trying to make that
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   really valuable, so if you have any interest
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   in receiving emails from me, especially really good ones,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   then come on by and subscribe
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   to the Radical Personal Finance email list.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I would be glad to have you there.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Our first caller today is Zach calling in from Illinois.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Zach, go ahead and introduce yourself
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and let me know what you'd like to talk about today, please.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   - Hi, so I'd like to talk about,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   if you were a 13-year-old like me
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and you wanted to become a financial advisor,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   knowing what you now know,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   what you would tell me I should be doing right now
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   to kind of prepare for that.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   - That is a brilliant question.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So you're 13 years old and you are interested
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   in becoming a financial advisor.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   When would you like to start working as a financial advisor?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   - So in your show when you're talking about
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   getting a bachelor's degree by 18,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   that's what I'm working on,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   so hopefully sometime around that time.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   - Okay, and when you think of the term financial advisor,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   what does that mean as far as what type of business
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   are you interested in, what type of areas
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   are you interested in working in?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   - Probably just helping people with their money
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   to be able to find out what they want and how to get there.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I don't know specifically who I'd want to work with
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   since I'm only 13.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I don't have experience with being an adult.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   - Right, well I applaud you for calling in,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and man, I hope that my son someday
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   when he's 13 years old is calling somebody smart
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and asking them good questions like that.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So I applaud you for that.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Here are a couple of ideas for you.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   A couple more questions just to clarify, though.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Would you be interested in working now
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   as an advisor of some kind,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   or is this something in the future
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   that you only want to do in the future?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Are you too busy where you can't do anything now,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   or is this something where you'd be interested
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   in getting into it now?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   - That'd be really cool to get into it right now,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   but I don't know how that would be possible.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   - So here's kind of the challenge
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   of trying to figure things out.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   The first challenge that you have to do is
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   you've got to develop a skill set
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   that's going to help somebody.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So there are many different types of financial advisors,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and there are some things that are easy to do
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and some things that are not easy to do.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And you've got to figure out,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and figure out based upon what can you do
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that's going to build a skill set.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So here are a couple of ideas and ways to approach it.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The first thing is to start with
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   the simplest of financial skills
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   that you can develop and market.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And in my mind, I think that would be
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   the skill of bookkeeping.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Your challenge as a 13-year-old is the same challenge
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   except worse that I faced when I was 23 years old.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I started in the business when I was 23 years old,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and I have underneath my massive red beard,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I have a baby face, and I look very young for my age.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And so take that and multiply it times way worse,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and you have that at 13 years old.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Now, if you walked into some wealthy person's house
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and you asked them at 13 years old for stewardship,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and you said, "Please, would you be willing
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   "to give me stewardship of your $10 million
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   "investment portfolio?"
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   They might be disinclined to say yes
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   because it would be hard for them to know
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   how could they be confident that you would actually
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   be able to deliver value.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   But you could develop a skill very simply
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   with good self-study through something like bookkeeping.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And business owners hire bookkeepers all the time.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You learn how to use QuickBooks, get the program,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   you go down and you get a book from the library
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   on how to use QuickBooks, or you buy a book on QuickBooks,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   and then you start working with local family and friends.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So if you can find a family business that you can work in,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   that's an ideal thing.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   If you can find some friends of businesses,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   maybe some parents of your friends
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   who have small businesses,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and you're looking for small businesses,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and you can start to say,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   "Hey, I'm building a bookkeeping business."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And the key is to find somebody
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   who'd be willing to train you.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So I would look to see if there's a connection
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   with an accountant or with a bookkeeper
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   who's already established that you can work with them.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And if you can work with them as an intern,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   that starts to help you to build financial skills,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   skills of bookkeeping.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Once you're competent, there's no reason why
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   you can't hire yourself out as a bookkeeper,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and there's no reason whatsoever
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   why you can't do that from an early age.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   The problem with starting work in your teen years
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   is you have to figure out how to get around
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   the child labor laws.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So there's all these stupid child labor laws
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   that keep teenagers from working.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And the answer, the way to get around them,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   is self-employment.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You can work for yourself,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and you can run your own business.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It's the same panther problem
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   that people like illegal immigrants face.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   They can't get a job
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   because they don't have a social security number,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   and they can't get a fake one for whatever reason,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   or the company won't accept it.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Well, the answer there is self-employment.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You start your own business.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And so you could start something
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   like a bookkeeping business,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   and that gets you around the topic of finance.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   If you find that it's a good fit for you,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   then a bookkeeping business could lead very easily
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   to an accounting business.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And one of the great things
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   about an accounting business
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   is it's very technical,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   it's pretty easily learned,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   and people would find it relatively simple
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   to place their confidence in you
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   if you can demonstrate your competence.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   The way that I would get into the accounting business
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   would be twofold.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I don't think you'll be able to do this yet,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   but for someone who's a little bit older,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   if you can find a seasonal company,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   like an H&R Block, something like that,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   you can get a job there,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   and you can get that with very minimal qualifications,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   with basic experience, prove basic competency.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And that will start to factor in
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   as the experience requirements that you need
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   if you're going to sit for something
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   like the CPA exam down the road.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   But the other way that I would go
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   is I would search for, again, find a local accountant,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   look for, ask your parents if they know people.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Your parents may be involved
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   in a local community service organization,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   something like a Kiwanis Club or a Rotary Club,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   something like that.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   They may be involved,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   there may be somebody in your church.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   If you go to a part of a church,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   usually there'll be a few accountants
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   in many normal-sizes churches.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   If not, you might have to start from scratch
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and try to find a place where you can intern
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   underneath an accountant.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And along the way, you can start studying
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   for your enrolled agent certification.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And the enrolled agent program
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   is the best way that I know of
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   for you to be able to start
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   to build your own tax practice.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And you don't need the experience requirements
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   that you need from the CPA.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   You don't need some of the educational requirements
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   that you need from the CPA,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   but you're authorized to practice before the IRS
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   and to represent clients before the IRS
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   with an enrolled agent designation.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The enrolled agent designation is a federal--
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   basically a series of exams.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So you get a book and you study it
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and you learn the material.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And I'm not aware of any reason why
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   you couldn't at 15 years old
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   have a tax practice of your own
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   and a bookkeeping practice of your own
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and be able to serve your clients
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   very, very competently.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The great thing about your age
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   is you can do this very informally
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and nobody will be offended by your
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   working out of your house.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Nobody will be offended by
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   you're not having an office.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You can do this with very low expense.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It's just a matter of marketing your services.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Then, from then on,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I would start to look at insurance.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And insurance is going to be the simplest
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and easiest way for you to start to move
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   from the world of accounting
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   into the world of financial advice.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And so I would consider getting
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   a life insurance license,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   a life insurance and a health insurance license
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   and try to find a local agency
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   with whom you can contract
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   as the general agency
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   to start to do a little bit of
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   life insurance business.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I'm not aware of any reason why
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   a young person can't have an insurance license.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   There may be in your state
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   some requirement that you have to be 18,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   but I'm not aware of that.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   So you would need to research that.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   If you find yourself blocked,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   no problem. Just adjust.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   This is what...
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So I can't stand licensing schemes.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I can't stand licensing schemes
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   because basically all licensing schemes
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   serve exclusively to protect the cabal
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   of people who are already established
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and already in the business.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's why licensing schemes exist.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   So it's designed to keep people like you out.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So if you find an age thing,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   you find a reason why you can't be licensed,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   then you've got to find a workaround
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and you've got to figure out
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   how can I adjust
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   and how can I offer a product
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   that will help people.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   A good person that you should look at
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   and that you should research
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   would be somebody like Caleb Maddox.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I think his name is spelled M-A-D-D-I-X.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But he's a young man.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   He's I think 15 years old now,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   something like that.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But he's been working as a motivational speaker
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   since he was about 11 or 12 years old.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   You can find his website.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He wrote a book that was basically called
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Success for Kids.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And for the last couple of years,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   for the last few years,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   he's been building a business
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   where he's been serving and working
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   as a success coach for kids.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And I don't remember his exact age,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   but something like 15 years old.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   But he earns in excess of six figures a year,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I would guess much more at this point in time,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   because he's done such a great job
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   with his business.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But he's doing a tremendous job
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   of building a business,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   serving kids with success coaching.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   You could do the same type of thing
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   in an area of personal finance.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   You could do something like that
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   where you developed a financial course
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   or a financial seminar
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   to teach other young men and women
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   how to handle their money.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And you did it from a unique age perspective
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   of your own age.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   The other thing that you can do
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   is you go and you pivot
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   and you go into a place
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   where there's no licensing required.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So my go-to example here
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   is social security planning.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   There's no reason why
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   you have to be a certain age
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   in order to build a business
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   working as a social security consultant.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I'm not aware of any licensing
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   that needs to be done.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I'm not aware of any board of requirements.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I'm not aware of any age, of anything,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   to market yourself
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   as a social security consultant.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   All you need is knowledge, expertise,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   and a good marketing plan.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And so if you, for example,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   let's say that you wanted to build
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   a business working as a financial advisor
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   but you found that
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   the Merrill Lynch guy's not going to hire you,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   the local financial advisor
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   doesn't think you can sell investments,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   you could build in the coming five years,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   you could build a tremendous knowledge
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and it'd be of tremendous service
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   in learning how to do social security planning.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   All you got to do is read
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   a half a dozen or a dozen books,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   carefully look at them,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   carefully study the material,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   and then you've put yourself
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   from a novice into the position of an expert
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   and you could give advice.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And you could build a business
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   where you provided social security consultation
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   for people who were in their 50s,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   their 60s, who were heading towards retirement.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You can provide a consultation
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   which would be well worth
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   $200, $300, $400 for an hour consultation
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   that would help them figure out
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   what social security filing strategy
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   they should implement.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So those are some of the ideas
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   that I would start with
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   because you're going to face
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   tremendous discrimination
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   because of your age in the mainstream world.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   One of the unfortunate things
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   about being a motivated young man
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   is you're going to face ageism,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   age discrimination based upon being young.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   So whenever you face discrimination,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   the secret is pivot and try to figure out
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   how to go in another route.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And this is what black people and women,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   when black people and women
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   have faced lots of discrimination in the past,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   the way that they were successful through it
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   was to pivot and don't take it head on.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So there were many women writers
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   who were fantastic writers,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   but they would write under a male pen name
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and they would just simply publish their work
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   using a man's name instead.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   There were many black people
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   who would face discrimination
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   based upon the color of their skin
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   if somebody found out that they were black,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   but all they needed to do
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   was to figure out a way to conceal that.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And so for you,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   it'd be the same kind of thing.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   You could develop skill
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   as a social security consultant,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   as an example.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And you could do that
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   primarily through written content and consulting,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and that minimizes the need
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   for people to see your face.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And I mean, you could go all kinds of crazy with this.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I have software that I could use very easily
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   to change your voice.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And so you could develop a more bassy voice
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   that sounds more appropriate.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   The two things that you gotta watch out for
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   as a young man is,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   number one, the tone of your voice
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   can sound very young
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   and the cadence of your speech.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   But you can practice
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   and change the cadence of your speech
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   and you can use digital equipment
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   to change the tone of your voice.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   So all of these problems are surmountable,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   but those are just a long list of ideas
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   of things that would be,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   if you were my son,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   those would be the first areas
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   that I would be encouraging you to focus on.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   - Wow, that's really cool.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Never thought of any of that.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   (laughing)
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   - Yeah, the key thing I would say is,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   of course, your primary focus at this point in time
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   should be knocking out your academics,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and you're obviously very focused on that.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So focus on knocking out your academics.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   But to get into the financial business,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   you wanna just start getting close to it
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   with whatever you can find.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   So it's a whole lot easier for you
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   to go the path that I've said,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   such as bookkeeper, accountant, consultant,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   move into insurance,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and then move into,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   if you find it's a good fit for you,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   if you find the skills that are helpful,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   then you find it's a good fit for you,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   then at that point in time,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   go ahead and move on to something like
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   trying to figure out
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   how to get a certified financial planner designation
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   or whatever it is that exists five years from now.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   The problem with the CFP board,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   or financial advisor world,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   is they're going to have to get hired
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   by most financial advisors.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I don't know if there's an age requirement
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   to have a securities license.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   You would have to research that.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   But the major problem is,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   who do you work with,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   and how do you build confidence in somebody?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And that's the problem with
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   the technical financial advisor space.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   The technical financial advisor space
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   involves the fact that
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   you're going to be governed by securities laws.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And in securities laws,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   you can't do the marketing,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   something like I've demonstrated.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   You have to do in-person solicitation, generally.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So if you're going to do in-person solicitation,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   that stacks the deck against you.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Now all of a sudden,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   you're trying to say to some,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   as a 13 or 15 year old,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   you're trying to say,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   "Hey, give me your $10 million."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   You've got no track record.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And you can't prove a specific skill.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   So focus on something
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   that you can prove a specific skill in,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   and also focus on building some way
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   that you can market yourself as an expert.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   First you become an expert,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   then you market yourself as an expert.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And when you can market yourself as an expert,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   then the discrimination that you face
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   because of your age will start to melt away.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And people's initial response of,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   "Ooh, this guy's super young,"
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   turns into, "Wow, this guy's fantastic."
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   That would be the encouragement I would give.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Finally, my other encouragement for you, Zach, is this.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   There's no reason why you can't,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   if you're really interested in investing,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   not just helping people with money,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   like if you're really into investing,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   there's no reason why in the next five years
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   you can't become a phenomenal investor
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and become a phenomenally knowledgeable person.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   There's a man who writes by the name of Joshua Kennan.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   His website is joshuakennon.com.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   He's now, I think, in his late 20s or early 30s.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   But he was somebody who,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   during his middle teenage years,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   early and middle teenager years,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   he was obsessed with investing.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And again, back to that ageism,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   how to overcome ageism.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He was writing, he is, I think, still,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   he is the columnist or the writer
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   for the website About,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   which is owned, I think, by the New York Times,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   for their personal finance
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   and their money and investing section.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And he's written tens of thousands of articles publicly,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   and he's a world-class expert.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   He is financially independent
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   through his own businesses
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and through his own personal finance prowess,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   his own investing prowess.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And he did that all during a time
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   when he looked very young,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and he sounded very young.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   But he played to his strengths.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He never tried to go out and focus on speaking in public.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   What he focused on was applying what he learned
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   with his own investment portfolio,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   building businesses that didn't require him
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   to be public-facing, and writing,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   in which it's the quality of your writing
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and the quality of your ideas
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   that made the difference.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   So he would be another person that you could look at
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and research some of his early years.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   On his blog, he used to have more personal information.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   He recently started an investing fund,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and so he doesn't have much of the personal information
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   on his blog anymore,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   but he has a very interesting story.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Any other questions, Zach?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Does that spark anything or anything else
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   you want to ask me before I go on?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   I think that's it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Keep up the great work.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It's so encouraging to me to get a call
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   from somebody like you,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   so keep up the great work, I think,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and keep in touch.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   We want to keep hearing what's going on.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Let's go to John in Pittsburgh.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Let me know how I can serve you today, please.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Yeah, hi, Joshua.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I'm not sure how to follow that one.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   It makes you feel like a loser, doesn't it?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Yeah, it really does.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I feel like a loser.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Yeah, it sounds like he'll be all right.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   I have probably a simple question
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   just on how to do some simple calculations,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I think, related to an income plan.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Okay.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So I've been trying to lay out
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   just kind of a forward-looking set of numbers
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   on a spreadsheet,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and what I did was very simply just set out
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   different buckets of assets
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   according to essentially how they're taxed.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's some taxable investments,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   401(k), Roth IRA, and traditional IRAs,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   and I just tried to project them
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   along with my age looking into the future
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   with some simple assumptions.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Okay.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And I also did a cost-of-living-per-year reduction,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and I only did some simple modifications to the numbers,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and I'm wondering where I may have gone wrong mathematically
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   because the projections didn't match.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I guess they were better than I expected.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   [Laughter]
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   All I simply did was I took an inflation rate
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   on my cost of living each year.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I think I looked it up,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and it came out with something like 3.18%,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   so I just did that every year.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It sounded like a reasonable number to use
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   that I just found on the Internet.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   If it's on the Internet, it must be true.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And for the other accounts,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   as far as their growth,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   before I started subtracting the yearly income
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   that I'd need to take from various buckets,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I just increased their value at 7%.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It might have been a little bit high.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Maybe that's why it was better than I expected,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   but I didn't think I should grow those only at 4%
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   because I thought that was kind of double-hedging the inflation.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Most people say chop 3% or 4% off for inflation,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   but I think if I did that with the increased cost of living,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I don't need to do that over in the other buckets for their growth.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's probably pretty hard to answer a question like that over spreadsheets.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I'm just kind of wondering if there's any templates to use or anything.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Why do you think that you don't have too much money?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Why do you think that the numbers aren't accurate?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Well, going back to probably another bad rule to use all the time,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   but if I use the 4% rule,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   I think I probably need to build up more than I have,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and maybe that just doesn't take into account
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   what I've been able to do on the spreadsheet,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   which is to "wisely" draw from different buckets at different times
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   when they're more advantageous.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   This is before getting into anything more complicated
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   like a conversion line or anything.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   This is just straight taking from buckets where it seems appropriate.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   But it got me out to--
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I think if I calculated the two areas
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   where I just took the most drastic measures of a 10% penalty
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   on the taxable buckets,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I still got myself out to age 95,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and that kind of surprised me, I guess.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And maybe it's just because I used a pretty aggressive 7% growth number.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I don't know if that's aggressive or not.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I guess I'm just kind of playing around
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   and using numbers I've heard other people say.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   - Okay. So it's a hard question, obviously,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   to answer in an audio format like this.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I can't answer the question. I can't take the spreadsheet.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   So it's hard to know.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   If you'd like to talk more about it, you can set up a consulting call.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   By the way, if any listener ever wants to just talk to me personally,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   you can always set up a phone call with me
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Those are paid consulting calls,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   but that's a pretty simple thing to do-- radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   So obviously I can't analyze the spreadsheet or anything like that.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Here would be how I would approach it, though, John.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   How many years between now and when you were trying to calculate
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   your retirement plans?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Is this within the next 10 years or 10 years out?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   - It was starting to withdraw within four years-- four or five years.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   - If you're in the place where you're starting to withdraw
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   within four or five years, then yes,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   you're going to get more precise with your calculations.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And so your precision in the financial planning situation--
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   a spreadsheet is not going to give you anything more than what I can do
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   with my financial planning calculator pretty easily.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And that's just to say, okay, if I did have a 7% growth
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and if we did have a 3% inflation rate,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   we just simply figure out what the inflation-adjusted return is
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and then we grow the money and figure out how the money's going to come out.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   But all you're going to get from that is a number.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And the reason it won't be perfectly accurate is because your returns
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   are not going to be perfectly consistent and perfectly accurate.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   So you can't really do any solid stress testing of it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   We're just kind of figuring out, are we in the right ballpark?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   In that context, that's why something like the 4% rule--
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   and the 4% rule is the idea that if you have a portfolio
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   that's made up of largely stocks, then you can withdraw from that portfolio
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   if the future is like the past in some way, a pretty similar way,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   you can withdraw from that portfolio about 4% per year of its value
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   adjusted for inflation, and you can do that for at least 30 years
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   basically into perpetuity.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   So that's the 4% rule.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   That's as good as anything you're going to get with a spreadsheet
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   to get you in the direction of knowing, do I have enough money saved?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   If you want to get beyond that, you need to talk to a financial planner
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   if you want to do things like do your own Monte Carlo analysis
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   or have them vary in a little bit more than that.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I guess you can use FireCalc, right? Isn't that one of the free ones?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   FireCalc will work on and help you. You can try FireCalc.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I've never played with it myself, but I know that's really popular
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   in the do-it-yourself community.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   But you're not going to get any better results.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   At the end of the day, when you're projecting a long retirement--
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   because you're not a traditional 65-year-old retiree--
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   when you're projecting a long retirement, you're basically taking a guess.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And you're saying, "Yeah, I think I've got enough money,"
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   whether it's based upon the 4% rule or anything.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   You're going to guess based upon the academic research and say,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   "Yes, I think it's going to last forever. I think I'll be okay."
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And then you're going to watch it as time goes on.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And you're going to watch it and see what your spending is.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   You're going to see what your income is.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   You're going to see how much you actually need to take out.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And you're going to need to crunch those numbers.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   At the end of the day, you're not going to get any better than a guess.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And you can make an educated guess, but it's just going to be a guess.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And a spreadsheet, in many ways, can give you a false confidence.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   A spreadsheet may not give you what you want.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   So, to me, I don't know if your calculations are right or not right,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   but 4% rule is as good a place to start as any.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   If you want to be super, super confident, then you can go on dividend rates
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and say, "How can I live on dividends?"
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   But at the end of the day, you're just going to have a guess,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   and you're going to watch it as time goes on.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And you're going to tighten your belt when your portfolio is down.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And as I am convinced, you're not going to quit and not be working.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   If you are going to quit and not be working,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   then you're going to want to be confident that your portfolio is large enough.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   So you're going to be earning income from time to time.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And at the end of the day, I think your confidence is going to come from
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   the size of the portfolio, recognizing that you've got plenty of money
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   to make changes, and then you just go for it and see,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   because you can't predict 50 years.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   You can't model 50 years.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And there's no way that the financial industry,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   even if you sit down with an advisor and they do a beautiful Monte Carlo simulation,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   there's no way that the financial advisor industry can model 50 years accurately.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I mean, the world in 50 years is going to be so different.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   So at the end of the day, you're saying, "I think I'm probably good to go.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   I've got quality investments.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I'm a smart guy.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I'm a good saver, and I can make it."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   I don't see any other option other than that.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   There's probably some things in the early retirement community I would reach out to.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   If I were you, I would take this question to Doug Nordman
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   or some of the other guys that are very active in the early retirement
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   who are actually retiring.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Those are the guys that I would take this question to and see.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   There are forums, there are communities of people that will take a look at your spreadsheet.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Try the Money Mustache community.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Try--I forget the name of it, but there's another forum that the early retirees hang out in.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Put your spreadsheet in there.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Put your scenarios in there, and they'll give you feedback.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   At the end of the day, I think it's just an educated guess.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   That's helpful, and I think that's probably what I need to hear
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   because my primary reason for wanting to do that wasn't necessarily to say,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   "Okay, yeah, I'm definitely good for a number of years."
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I really wanted to see how that--whatever answer I came up with--
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   changed over the next few years as the market goes up or more than likely down,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and I wanted to see how far it pushed out forward or backwards.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Some of my main motivations for doing it, but I didn't want to enter in with an incorrect,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   like you said, guessing model into that as I go forward.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   So I was trying to work out the bugs.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But that's a good idea to ask the forums, and maybe a coaching call would be a good idea to get it taken out.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Yeah, I'd be happy to do that.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And the forums are great because the forums will do--
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   the forums do a great job of having people who are actually doing it,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   who are going to get the lifestyle, who are going to get what you're going for.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   They're going to understand what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I mean, one of the best things that happens about the world we live in
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   is the easy access to other people, like-minded people in forums,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   specialized forums who can help you.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So let me know if I can help you more in the future.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Let's go to--I got a 619 phone number from San Diego, California.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Let me know who you are, and let's see how I can serve you today, please.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   If I had a producer, this would be great.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Let's try again.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   619 phone number, San Diego, California.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Who's that?
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Well, hey, if it happens on live, radio can happen on my podcast.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   All right, that's it.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I thought we had one more call, but I think that's it for today's show.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Thank you all for listening to the Q&A call.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   How's that for a diversity of even two questions,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   but two super interesting questions?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Hopefully there were some ideas to spark your creativity.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I am so passionate about--I probably showed pretty obviously,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   but I am so passionate about people like that 13-year-old young man.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   He's got such an awesome opportunity, and it's easy to kind of--
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I think it's important not to put too much pressure on people,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   but I do want to just show the opportunities.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   I mean, if you look at what someone--Caleb Maddox is one of a kind,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   but you look at what he's been able to do--I need to see if I can get him on the show.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You look at what he's been able to do, he'll blow your brain from what you
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   and I thought we could do when we were younger.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   That's it for listening.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Thank you all so much for being here.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I would love it if you'd like to participate in a call like this in the future.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Number one, this one was sent out to the email list,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   so join us on the email list.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You can sign up for that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.

[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   That community group is over 1,000 people now and lots of people interacting there.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I'm pretty accessible there, so jump into the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And thank you to those of you who have been sending in your pictures and your voicemails.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I'm starting to get voicemails.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I've been getting a bunch of voicemails.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   If you're not aware of it, I'd love for you to just--if you're listening to the show,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   if you wouldn't mind, send me a picture of yourself or your family.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I'm making just a screensaver that I can look at it.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I like that, and it helps me to be able to see who my audience is instead of just staring at a microphone.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And then more importantly, for episode 500, I want to do a show just kind of profiling the changes that you've made in your life.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   So if over the last couple of years, if it's been since listening to Radical Personal Finance, that's really cool, of course.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   But if over the last few years you've been making progress, you've learned something, do me a favor.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Pull out your cell phone, record a quick little voice memo of about two to three minutes, and tell us what's happened.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Radical Personal Finance is not for the elite.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Radical Personal Finance is for you and me.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And so I want to make sure that I profile real stories from real people, and that means you.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   So grab your phone, record a voice memo, two or three minutes, tell us what you've learned on Radical Personal Finance and the changes that you've made in your life.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Email that to me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
