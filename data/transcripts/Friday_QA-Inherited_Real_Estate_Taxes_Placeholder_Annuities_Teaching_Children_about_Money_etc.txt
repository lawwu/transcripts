[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   - Hey, Josh.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   Can you hear me all right?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   - Sounds good. Go ahead, sir.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.160]   - Can you hear me?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.800]   There you go. Hey.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   Thanks for having me today.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.540]   Just had a couple, two questions about my parents,
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300]   if you have the time for both of them.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.100]   - Okay.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.940]   - First, I'll give you a quick background.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.400]   They're both 65 and they've owned a furniture business
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.940]   for about 15 years or so.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.040]   They've been basically neutral for them
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.680]   as far as financial success goes.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.820]   They've just paid themselves about 60 grand annually
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.020]   and are planning on going out of business sale next year.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.020]   - Okay.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.020]   - So they have to use the proceeds of that sale
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.920]   to pay off some debt the store carries.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.600]   And so they're just right about ready to retire.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.560]   And the only thing that's been a saving grace for them
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.740]   is two inheritances.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.440]   So the first question is in regards to the most recent one.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   My grandma passed this year, my dad's mom.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   And so they inherited one property that she owned
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.680]   when she died.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   And then they also,
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.820]   she had another home that she gifted to them
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.620]   about seven years ago.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.620]   So they netted about 26K each on the inherited one
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.360]   and 59K on the gifted property.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.700]   Just wondering what their tax implications are
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.860]   on these two situations.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.160]   - The inherited property,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.080]   assuming that your grandmother owned that
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.540]   at the date of her death,
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.360]   the inherited property will have a step up in tax basis,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.500]   which means that if she paid $50,000 for it,
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.620]   when she died it was worth $150,000.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.060]   Your parents inherited the property
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.860]   with a tax basis of $150,000.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.780]   So if they sell the property for $150,000,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.660]   there will be no taxes due.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.980]   If they sell the property for more than $150,000,
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.860]   they will inherit,
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.100]   they'll pay the taxes on whatever gain there may be
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.220]   from the valuation at the date of death
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.580]   versus at the date of sale.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.780]   So if they sell the property for $170,000,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.860]   then they'll pay taxes on $20,000 of gain.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.340]   Now the property that was gifted to them by their parents
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.260]   has an inherited tax basis in it.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.020]   So whatever your grandparents' tax basis
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.500]   in the property was,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.220]   that's what your parents will have as their tax basis.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.620]   'Cause when you gift property like that,
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.960]   it keeps the tax basis that it had originally.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.180]   So if your grandparents had a tax basis of $50,000,
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.460]   they gave it to your parents when it was worth $100,000,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.360]   your parents sell it for $150,000,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.740]   they will pay taxes on $100,000 worth of gain.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.460]   The difference between your grandparents' tax basis
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.840]   and the current value at the date of sale.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.380]   - Okay, so it's a little bit complicated in that one.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.300]   And I kind of knew the first answer,
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.860]   but just wanted to clarify.
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.400]   So the second part,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.460]   when the property was gifted to them,
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.060]   it was a brand new built cabin
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.380]   on some lake front that they had.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.260]   And the tax assessment went way up
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.460]   'cause they just had this old junky cabin on it before.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.060]   And now they built a cabin that the taxes were
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   about a $400,000 property,
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.420]   but it was way overvalued.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.140]   And they sold it for about 260.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.660]   So with the loss,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.780]   does that mean that they're gonna get out
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.940]   away from taxes on that?
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.540]   - Depends not on what the assessed value is,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.540]   but rather what the adjusted basis is
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.540]   of the original property owner.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.020]   So what you would need to do is find out
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.660]   how much did my grandparents pay for the land?
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.300]   That would be the first bit.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.380]   How much did they pay for any improvements to the property?
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   Capital improvements, such as building a new house on it.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.100]   And then whatever those total costs are,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.100]   that's called the adjusted basis.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.900]   And that's the basis that your parents
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.260]   will have in the property.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.900]   That's what they'll pay taxes on.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.300]   - Okay, so they bought this whole lake
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.880]   back in the '40s for 4,800 bucks.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.600]   It's about a 50 acre lake with all the property around it.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.640]   They sold it,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.000]   my grandma and her two brothers sold it
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.640]   in about 2005 for about 4 million.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.680]   And they each got to keep their parcel on the land
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.760]   with old beat up cabins that were probably worth
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.360]   next to nothing at the time.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.720]   So they each took their proceeds and built a new cabin.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.080]   So it's a little bit muddy.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   I'm just trying to figure out
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.120]   that, is that giving you any other direction?
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.520]   - You will have to sit down and make something up
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.120]   that you can defend with a straight face
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.200]   in front of a tax auditor for some way.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.760]   Clearly, it's not going to be an easy thing,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.520]   but the gift of this property
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.480]   is a major financial planning mistake.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.240]   It should not have been gifted.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.040]   It should have been kept in the estate
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.360]   until the death of your grandparents.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.440]   So giving it was a major financial planning mistake
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.400]   from a tax perspective.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   So at this point in time,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.680]   what you have to do is you have to sit down
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.720]   and you have to do your very best to come up with
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.440]   what is the inherited basis of the property?
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.960]   What actually do we owe on the property
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.760]   because of what was its actual tax basis?
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.120]   And there are rules that would be followed
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.520]   if you have the records,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.160]   but it sounds like you're basically going to be sitting down
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.640]   and making something up that's plausible.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.400]   And there's going to be a little bit of wiggle room there
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.440]   on what's plausible,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.000]   but I'd recommend that you sit down first.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.240]   I mean, it's fairly straightforward
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.640]   if you're competent to do it,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.960]   if you have the records,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.520]   but you basically have to sit down and say,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.800]   what was this property worth at the time?
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.560]   How much money did they have invested in it?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.960]   Did they have any records on it?
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.840]   Et cetera.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   If not, you'll have to make something up
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.640]   and you'll just want to make something up
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.520]   that is appropriate.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.640]   So that if the return gets audited,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.360]   that the auditor will at least be able to say,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.840]   oh yes, I can see that what you were trying to do
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.440]   was to do the right thing.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.120]   You were trying to find the best solution
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   and I can see how you got to that solution
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.320]   based upon the data that you had.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   So one thought, is this a livable property?
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.040]   Do you think it has, first of all,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.600]   how much gain would you guess does this property have in it
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.240]   as far as what it's worth to sell
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.040]   versus what you would guess would be the adjusted basis?
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   - I think it's pretty close to a wash.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.320]   I mean, it's a pretty,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   they probably put 250 into building the property
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.520]   and the brothers did all the work throughout the summers.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.440]   - Okay, so if it's pretty close to a wash, then that's fine.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.040]   Then you just want to demonstrate that
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.440]   and you won't have much of a tax bill due on it.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.680]   If they spent $250,000 on materials
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.720]   and building the property,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.280]   then the property will have a basis of $250,000
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.080]   if it was sold for 250.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.480]   So I think that's all you need.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.080]   All I was going to recommend is that in a situation like this
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.760]   the best out would be either for,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.520]   would be two things.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.440]   The direct path would be for your parents
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   to move into the property for two years
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.360]   to take advantage of the capital gain exclusion
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.280]   for the sale of a personal property.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.920]   If the property were the kind of property
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.840]   where they could live in it for two years,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.080]   then that might be an appropriate solution
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.600]   for them to get rid of the gain.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.200]   And of course this would apply to perhaps
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   some other listener not in this particular situation
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.640]   because it doesn't sound like you have a tax problem here
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.880]   because of the low sale price compared to the adjusted basis.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.120]   The second solution would be that your parents
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.040]   could convert the property into a rental property
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.360]   if it's not already.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.840]   And then as a rental property,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.560]   they could list it on the marketplace
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.480]   and they could do a 1031 exchange
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.600]   for another rental property that they could use
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   or another property that they would own.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.760]   And then that would not eliminate the gain,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.680]   that particular step wouldn't eliminate the gain,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.360]   but it would defer the gain.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.260]   And so if they could defer the gain to another property,
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.960]   then that would buy them a little bit more time
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.200]   to solve the tax problem.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.040]   And then potentially if they bought another property
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.260]   as a rental property that they later decided to move into
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.760]   after renting it out or after attempting to rent it out,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.980]   if they later moved into that property,
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.760]   that rental property and lived there for two years,
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.520]   then they could potentially shelter that gain
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.880]   and again, take advantage of the exclusion on capital gains
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.760]   from the sale of a personal residence.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.640]   But in your situation, it sounds like those are unnecessary.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.980]   I would just caution in the future,
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.680]   if anyone is ever giving appreciated property,
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.800]   any kind of appreciated long-term capital gains property,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.180]   so this includes real estate, family home,
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.080]   vacation cabin on the lake, this includes stocks,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.520]   this includes any kind of long-term capital gain property,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.360]   appreciated long-term capital gain property
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   is ideally held by the original owner
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.880]   until the date of death in order for the original owner,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.240]   in order for there to be a step up in tax basis.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.600]   And even if you use other assets to make the gift instead,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.280]   or you use other sources of financing,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.080]   the person who's the receiver of the gift
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.020]   takes out a loan or something to cover a cash shortfall.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.640]   If you have substantially appreciated
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.480]   long-term capital gains property,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.960]   getting that step up in tax basis
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.840]   is a big deal from a tax perspective.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.760]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.120]   You got time for one more quick one?
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.040]   - Yep, go ahead quickly.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.520]   - It may not be quick.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   So I'm trying to set them up
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.600]   to have the safest possible retirement
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.560]   with their current situation.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.520]   They haven't really accumulated any savings.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.040]   They've got about 21,000 in IRAs,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.400]   but because of the inheritances,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.720]   they have 114,000 in savings.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.680]   Their house is paid for and their vehicles are paid for.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.960]   The only debt they have is a $28,000 student loan
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.400]   that's at 8%.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.320]   And their social security is gonna be about 2,800 a month
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.560]   with their expenses being 2,200 a month.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.620]   Just trying to figure out,
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.960]   I'm assuming they should pay off the student loan at 8%
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.480]   and max out their IRAs for this year and next year.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.200]   And I'm not sure how many years they should do that
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.480]   or what the best use of their savings would be
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.040]   and any other ideas you might have
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.520]   to help give them safety.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.640]   And real estate, I know that's something
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.720]   that my wife and I are into
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.440]   and we love listening to your talks about that,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   but they are just definitely not interested
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.320]   in doing anything with real estate.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.680]   - So the first piece of advice that I have
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.280]   is not a numbers advice,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.760]   but it's very much a matter of
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.060]   what are you going to do with your life?
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.060]   And I know that's beyond the scope of this conversation,
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.320]   but it's the fundamentally most important thing
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.660]   that I can possibly think of to say.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.400]   Because if you take people who've been active,
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.880]   who've owned a family business,
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.840]   and they're 65 years old, or 66 years old,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.400]   and they're in good health,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   and you all of a sudden substitute
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.720]   that basic structure of life that came with work
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.560]   that related to the meaning of going to work every day
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.920]   and contributing to your local community,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.840]   and you substitute that with sitting around
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.280]   and doing nothing,
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.480]   that's what makes people get old and die very, very quickly,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.600]   is the loss of meaning in life.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.900]   And it's a very difficult transition to make.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.680]   And I think in general, a very unwise transition to make.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.120]   To put it into a few memorable statements,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.080]   I'm convinced that you should always retire to something
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.560]   if you're going to retire.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.160]   The goal is not to be inactive.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.660]   The goal is to retire to something,
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.440]   to something that you do.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.340]   Now, in many cases,
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.960]   I think that that's something that you do, should,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.280]   and probably in many cases will, involve some form of work.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.520]   That work might be paid, or it might be unpaid.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.080]   That work can be going and helping in the furniture store,
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.520]   working as a salesman,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.480]   after the store is sold to somebody else.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.260]   Or in this case, you said it was going out of business sale,
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.200]   but you get the idea.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.720]   Going and working in a furniture store
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.880]   could be a great thing.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.200]   It might be unpaid work.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.480]   It might mean that your mom has always had a passion
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.640]   for helping young women.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.120]   And so she goes and works in a crisis pregnancy center
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.320]   50 hours a week.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   Or your dad has always had a passion for saving raccoons.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.720]   And so he volunteers his time out to go and trap raccoons
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.560]   and transport them to the forest.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.400]   It can be anything,
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.000]   but it should be some things clear and specific.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.440]   Some people will have goals of things
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.400]   that they're retiring to that involve hobbies.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.320]   For example, their hobby might be climbing
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.920]   all the 14,000 foot peaks in Colorado.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.100]   Their hobby might be picking up antiques
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.680]   and shopping from coast to coast of the United States
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.920]   at little out of the way antique stores
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.560]   and putting them on eBay.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.800]   Their hobby might be any number of things.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.880]   There's no limit to what they can do.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.620]   But the most important thing that they need to do
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.560]   is to clarify what are they going to spend their time doing?
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.040]   And it must not involve the idea of sitting at home.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.860]   It must not involve the idea of watching TV.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.360]   It must not involve these things,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.520]   because if they do that,
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.680]   they will get sick and die very, very quickly.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.640]   So once you know the answers to that,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.880]   then the financial outcome will be more apparent.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.520]   So if, for example, your dad gets a job
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.200]   as a furniture salesman
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.920]   for his buddy's furniture store across town,
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.520]   and he's making 2,500 bucks a month doing that,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.000]   but basically he hangs out and drinks coffee with the guys
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.440]   and shows furniture to a salesman when interested,
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.000]   well, now all of a sudden they have no financial problem,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.200]   and you have an extra 2,500 bucks
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.240]   more than what they're currently spending.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.120]   That's very different than if they say,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.560]   "Okay, we're gonna live at home
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.360]   "and stay at home in our house,
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.700]   "and in that situation, we're only spending $2,200 a month.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.320]   "We got a $600 surplus,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.200]   "and your dad's gonna go and volunteer
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.800]   "with the local boys club or something like that
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.360]   "to help disadvantaged youth."
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.880]   That's very different than if they say,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.080]   "Well, what we actually wanna do is we wanna go travel,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.680]   "and so we wanna travel six months of the year
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.160]   "and set ourselves up for that."
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.040]   And so the answer to what they're going to do,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.760]   in my opinion, is going to lead them in the direction
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.880]   of what they should do with their money.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.680]   If they're gonna earn income,
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.360]   then you can invest the money.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.440]   If they don't wanna own real estate,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.160]   I think it would be fine to invest it into mutual funds.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.000]   Would be totally reasonable.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.600]   Or they could invest it into real estate with you.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.560]   If you have a track record of some kind
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.120]   where you can demonstrate that,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.280]   "Hey, I could use the money,
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.560]   "and we can invest it profitably,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.160]   "and I'll do the management work for you,
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.800]   "and I'll charge a management fee,
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.160]   "but this will be a property that you own,"
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.360]   I think that's a reasonable thing to do.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.480]   If they don't need the money,
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.480]   then you have to ask yourselves,
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.760]   how much money do they need just in savings?
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:13.480]   $100,000 in, let's see, 115 minus 30 would be $75,000.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.360]   In my opinion, $75,000 in savings is not an awful lot.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.480]   I would feel very happy
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.000]   if they just kept the money in savings.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.960]   I don't see any need for them.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.360]   I don't know what benefit they get necessarily
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.240]   for going and putting small amounts of money like that
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.600]   into most investments.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.240]   I would feel comfortable with that
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.120]   just being the cash cushion that they have
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.440]   as their personal emergency savings.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.240]   They don't need the income from investments
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.760]   because of their social security,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.200]   and so that savings could be something
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.920]   that could be very useful for them.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.480]   And I would think that there may be some spending things
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.640]   that they might wanna do in the future
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.880]   where they would want that savings
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   to be available for spending.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.280]   So back to the traveling across the country thing,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.840]   that's the kind of money that they would use
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.960]   for buying an RV or fixing up an RV
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.240]   or buying a truck camper or something like that.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.520]   Then I would probably think with that amount of money
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.560]   and the fact that they can live
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.120]   on their social security income,
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.480]   I would probably think the best thing
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.880]   is to keep it in savings and use it for emergency funds
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.760]   and big ticket items.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.640]   - Okay, yeah, they've got a truck and a trailer,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.080]   and that's basically their biggest ambition in retirement
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.360]   is seeing all the national parks
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.360]   and then also getting involved in raising the grandbabies
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.560]   as my wife and I start to build a family here.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.040]   So I think that that kinda makes sense
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.440]   to keep some cash around then.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.840]   And do you think that they should definitely pay
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   that student loan off at 8% with the savings they have?
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.920]   - Who is liable for the student loan?
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.240]   - They are, it's a parent loan
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.720]   that they got from me and my sister
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.640]   when we were in college.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.960]   - They're jointly liable?
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.880]   - Yeah.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.500]   - Okay, yeah, I think they should pay off the student loan.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.320]   8% is a steep interest rate,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.120]   a very nice guaranteed return for them on paying that off.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.320]   The reason I asked about the liability was,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.140]   well, if one of them is liable,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.940]   could the student loan die with one of them
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.040]   if one of them were in poor health?
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.800]   But if they're jointly liable and they're in good health,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.000]   I don't think that's a good strategy.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.200]   So yeah, I think paying off the student loan would work.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.040]   And it doesn't sound like they've been
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.800]   financially irresponsible,
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.560]   but one of the things that I would do very strongly
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.080]   in that situation is I would have a serious talk
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.800]   about not going into debt.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.760]   Because you can live very well on social security income
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.160]   with a little bit of savings and have everything paid off.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.760]   You can live very well in that situation.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.060]   But you can't live very well in that situation
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.440]   if you start overspending by going into debt.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.600]   And so I would strongly encourage them
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.380]   to absolutely refuse in any way, shape or form
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.040]   to go into debt so that they can always live well
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.800]   on their social security income.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.440]   - Okay, that sounds great.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.520]   Yeah, that student loan,
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.220]   I'll give them an extra 300 a month too,
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.560]   so that'll give them more cushion.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.680]   - Perfect, cool.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.880]   Well, thanks for the question, Parker.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.040]   We go now to John in Pennsylvania.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.320]   John, welcome back, how can I serve you today, sir?
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.480]   - Hey Joshua, thanks for taking the call.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.960]   I've got a list of open-ended, more fun questions,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.360]   but I gotta get this kind of technical,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.520]   hopefully quick question out of the way
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.640]   'cause it's been bugging me.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.600]   I was talking to an insurance salesman
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.360]   and the topic of annuities had come up briefly.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.680]   And there were some reasons from your old shows
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.320]   that I was considering some of them in the future,
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   but the topic came up of doing a placeholder
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.760]   annuity strategy, meaning taking,
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.160]   I think they referenced something along the lines
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.240]   of about $10,000 and doing a placeholder
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.880]   to lock in mortality rates,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.680]   and then being able to put more money into annuity later
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.800]   with those locked in rates.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.400]   Is there, I guess I really wasn't sure of
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.080]   when that's appropriate or what you would do that for
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.600]   and if it's worth it overall.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.040]   I'm sure the answer is it depends,
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.600]   but I'm just curious to get your take on that.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.120]   - Yeah, I would rate this particular comment
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.440]   as it's true, first of all,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.440]   but it seems, it's true, it's true.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.960]   I think I have probably, when I sold annuities,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.240]   I probably have referenced it.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.520]   Because it's not factually incorrect,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.080]   and I'll explain the facts in just a moment.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.200]   It's not factually incorrect,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.800]   but I'm not sure that it's particularly relevant
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.400]   to most situations.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.360]   I think it's a very thin reason for,
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.880]   a thin reason for a buyer to buy an annuity
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.680]   exclusively for that.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.920]   Now, there can be other compelling reasons
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.040]   which when that one's added in to buy a placeholder annuity,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.240]   but if that were the only reason to buy it,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.680]   that's one of those things where it's not wrong,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.160]   but it is a little bit thin.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.480]   And so let me explain.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.800]   Annuities are insurance contracts,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.080]   and as such, they work based upon mortality tables.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   The mortality tables used to be calculated to age 100,
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.040]   but a couple decades ago,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.200]   insurance companies realized
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.320]   that people were living longer,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.000]   and this was actually causing major problems
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.120]   in the insurance price
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.320]   because people's life insurance contracts
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.760]   were endowing at the age of 100.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.120]   My grandmother is 106 years old.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.720]   If she had purchased a whole life insurance contract
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.560]   when she was young
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.600]   and still owned that life insurance contract,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.160]   then six years ago,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.120]   her life insurance contract would have paid her
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.840]   the face amount of the policy
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.520]   regardless of the fact that she was actually alive
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.680]   because that's how the contract language works.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.240]   It says this contract, it goes out to age 100,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.560]   and so she would have received
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.040]   from her life insurance contract
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.160]   a big check on her 100th birthday.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.880]   Now, that's not ideal.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.000]   You think, "Oh, it's great.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.160]   I outlived my life insurance."
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.340]   It's fun for a joke,
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.840]   but from a financial planning perspective,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.760]   that's not ideal.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.600]   You don't want to do that
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.400]   because now the life insurance
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.560]   is not doing what it was supposed to do.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.040]   It's not going until somebody's death.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.440]   It messes up the taxation of it.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.840]   It messes up the estate transfer.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.600]   It messes up the reason for buying the life insurance,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.680]   and so it's not ideal.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.840]   Now, is it the worst thing in the world?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.320]   I don't want to overstate the problem,
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.160]   but it's not ideal.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.400]   It's not why you're buying a life insurance contract.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.920]   So a couple decades ago,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.360]   the commissioner, they call him the CSO,
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.880]   the Commissioner Standard,
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.960]   oh, I'm forgetting the acronyms,
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.600]   the standard mortality tables
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.320]   that are used by all insurance companies
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.960]   were updated to go out to age 120.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.280]   So now in today's world,
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.480]   if you buy an ordinary whole life insurance contract,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.560]   that ordinary whole life insurance contract
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.440]   is calculated from your current age up to age 120,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.560]   and if you outlive it to 121,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.920]   it will endow at 120.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   So annuity tables also use these particular,
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.240]   these tables to calculate their payouts.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.640]   So the argument as to why you should
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.480]   buy a placeholder annuity would go like this.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.920]   Listen, if you buy this annuity today,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.960]   its rates only go out to 120,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.000]   which means a higher payout for you
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.360]   when you're young versus later.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.620]   But it's possible that given increasing lifespans,
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.900]   it's possible that they'll recalculate these rates
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.280]   in the coming decades and go out to age 140.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.680]   And so in this situation,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.480]   you could win because you,
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.600]   when you were 40 years old,
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.320]   you bought this $10,000 placeholder annuity,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.200]   which was under these old rates,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.960]   and now you have this old annuity
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.000]   that you can put $300,000 into
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.160]   and get a better deal on your payment
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.080]   than you will with one of the newer annuities
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.960]   that's based on going to age 140.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.480]   So do I rate it as true?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.960]   I rate it as technically true.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.480]   It is possible,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.760]   but there's a lot of assumptions baked in there.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.920]   Number one, that rates will get readjusted.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.080]   I think there's a good chance that they might,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.240]   but it's not likely in the coming years.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.360]   Famously, just about two years ago,
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.400]   life expectancy has actually decreased
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.320]   for a couple of years,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.280]   which changed a very significant trend.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.160]   And while I think that there are exciting things happening
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.800]   in human longevity and human aging space,
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.720]   some really exciting scientific stuff happening,
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   I don't think that those expansions in life expectancy
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.520]   are likely to trade over to the population at large
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.780]   anytime soon.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.040]   The population at large in most countries is so sick
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.480]   with degenerative diseases, mainly lifestyle diseases,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.080]   that I wouldn't expect there to be a significant change
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.860]   in life expectancy across the population at large.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.180]   I do think wealthy people who are health nuts,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.640]   who can afford all the best treatments
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.000]   and can take all of the latest treatments
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and medically advised things to extend lifespan,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.240]   there's some compelling evidence that it can work.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.880]   But this is mainly, at this point, a billionaire's play space
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.980]   where the wealthiest of the wealthy
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.740]   are engaging in this kind of work,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.840]   but I don't think it's gonna translate over
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.560]   in the next decade or two to the population at large.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.200]   And then finally, if annuities make sense
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.560]   in somebody's plan,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.720]   and I think that in many retirement plans,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.060]   they do make sense,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.640]   I think they'll make sense regardless
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.600]   of what the mortality tables are.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.920]   And so I never went back and calculated
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.160]   what the payout would be on an annuity
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.720]   that was priced out to age 100
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.760]   versus one that's priced out to age 120.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.600]   I never did that.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.720]   So I can't say that I've done the analysis,
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.600]   but I think that it's unlikely
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.680]   that the basic usefulness of annuities
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.880]   would change all that much
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.960]   if the underlying mortality tables changed.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.040]   And then finally, what I would say is,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   if you have an insurance policy with a company
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.680]   and that insurance agent hears threats
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.880]   about them changing the mortality tables,
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.560]   then that's when I would buy one.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.160]   And I think that this is one reason
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.200]   to have an insurance agent that you talk to
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.240]   and that speaks with.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.800]   If I were an insurance agent and this were happening,
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.840]   I would sell 500 annuities in two weeks
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.280]   because that is a very compelling argument.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.120]   I did this when long-term care insurance policies
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:42.940]   were changing.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.960]   I was an insurance agent
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.440]   and they were changing the long-term care insurance policies
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.680]   and they were eliminating the lifetime benefits
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.800]   of long-term care policies.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.160]   It used to be you could buy a policy that was unlimited
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.500]   with the amount of money it would pay out
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.160]   for long-term care.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.020]   But the insurance companies were overexposed to that risk.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.580]   And so what they did was they decided to discontinue that
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.400]   and cap all long-term care insurance contracts
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.480]   where instead of them being an open-ended commitment,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.400]   they would be committed to a maximum cap of benefits
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.960]   based on the daily rate and the period of time.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.520]   So we had like a three-week warning bell,
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.240]   something like that, that our company was going
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.600]   to be discontinuing the lifetime benefits.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.160]   I picked up the phone and I lived on the phone
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   for the next two weeks
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.320]   and I called every single client of mine
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.960]   who had ever expressed an interest
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.720]   in long-term care insurance.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   And I sold, I don't wanna exaggerate, but I sold a lot.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.880]   It was something like 60 to 70 long-term care insurance
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.160]   policies in a week and a half.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.260]   It may have been more, it was a lot.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.140]   And because I picked up the phone and I said,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.060]   listen, here's the facts.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.780]   This policy is going away.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.840]   If you're interested in this policy,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.040]   you have to get something.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.980]   And I was working from early morning to late at night
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.660]   and I sold them like crazy.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.380]   And so what I would say is just tell your insurance agent,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.060]   listen, if you ever hear that they're actually
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.780]   changing the mortality tables, call me
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.860]   and then I'll buy the annuity,
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.160]   but I'm not gonna buy a $10,000 annuity today.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.700]   - Yeah, no, that sounds reasonable.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.000]   I'm actually more glad I asked that question.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.140]   I had assumed that locking in mortality rates
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.660]   had more to do with my current age
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.380]   versus an age when I might buy it,
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:29.100]   say 10 years from now, rather than the ending age.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.500]   And that's what's in reference to the mortality table.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.100]   So I'm really glad I got that clarification.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.740]   I don't think the source of the money matters,
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.860]   but the only other thing he mentioned was
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.300]   that he was thinking about it for my qualified IRA money
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.380]   to be used for that.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.300]   But I don't think the source really matters that much.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.140]   But thanks for that clarification.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   That's really good to know.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.300]   - Yeah, you can make some other thin arguments
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.060]   as a certain policy feature.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.680]   That's the big one in the annuity marketplace.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.260]   There have been some exotic annuities sold over the years
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.660]   that were substantially mispriced.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.540]   And I think it's important to recognize
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.100]   that insurance companies don't always get it right.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.020]   And so there have been annuities over the years,
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.120]   especially in the fixed indexed annuity space,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.580]   where the guarantees that the insurance company
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.600]   put into the contract were so rich
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.100]   that if you had bought one of those annuities,
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.400]   you made off like a bandit.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.460]   I reviewed policies back when I was an insurance agent.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.460]   I reviewed policies that were sold in the 1990s.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.580]   And the contractual minimums,
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.620]   people would get letters from the insurance company saying,
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.620]   dear client, we are hereby offering to buy out your annuity
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.900]   and substitute it for this other contract
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.020]   with a bonus.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.400]   If you ever get a letter like that
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.900]   from your insurance company,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.980]   no matter what, don't accept the offer.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.420]   Take it straight, run straight to the insurance agent
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.660]   and figure out why they wanna buy you out.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.060]   Because they did this.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.720]   They promised, they put guarantees
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   in some of these contracts in the 90s
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.780]   that were so rich that there was no way
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.660]   that the investment returns were going to pay out.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.740]   And now what most insurance companies will do
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.060]   is in the situation,
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.940]   if they realize they've mispriced the product,
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.300]   number one, they stop selling the product.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.180]   Number two, if the product is mispriced,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.440]   they may go ahead and segregate those products
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.420]   over into a separate pool.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.140]   And so they put all the risk and they say,
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.740]   hey, this is a really risky bunch of insurance contracts
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.140]   that we're gonna lose money on
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.180]   'cause we didn't get the pricing scheme right.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.820]   And so they put them over into a pool
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.460]   where they can service them separately.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.060]   And they try to de-risk that portfolio as they can
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.660]   by sending out letters and whatnot
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.700]   and offering to buy people out.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.460]   So they try to de-risk that pool.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.460]   Now, in most situations, the insurance company,
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.840]   a big insurance company that's financially healthy,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.380]   they're gonna stand by their contracts.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.460]   They don't wanna be sued and they're not gonna be sued
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.560]   because they're gonna stand by the contracts.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.100]   But they very much are hoping
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.060]   that people will drop the contracts.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.180]   They very much are hoping that you'll look down and say,
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.260]   oh, I put $10,000 in this silly annuity
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.780]   and I'll take it out and I'll just spend the 10,000 bucks
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.300]   'cause that helps them to de-risk
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.460]   and de-leverage the portfolio.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.920]   So there can be reasons like that to buy a contract.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.540]   But in general, those are the same kinds of contracts
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.940]   that the personal finance space
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.220]   and the consumer finance space will say,
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.740]   oh, these contracts are terrible.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.260]   And in many cases they are, I'm not denying that.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.520]   But when you sit and read the contract,
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.740]   sometimes you look and you say,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.460]   this contract is stinking amazing.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.660]   They're gonna guarantee me this?
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.260]   Well, man, if they're gonna guarantee me this,
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.340]   I'm gonna take it.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.820]   And it may be that they were just caught up
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.020]   in a competitive environment and they over-promised.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.460]   Now, with an annuity, you always have to recognize
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.220]   you're always dealing with an insurance company here
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.340]   and that insurance company
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.080]   has to stand good for the products,
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.860]   which means it's theoretically possible
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.540]   that the insurance company may default on its promise.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   And if a product is so substantially mispriced
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.260]   that that could be the thing
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.660]   that drives the insurance company into bankruptcy,
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.420]   and then you get whatever the bankruptcy trustee decides
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.380]   you get through the court process.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.100]   But it's very unusual for that to happen.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.940]   But things like that can be good reasons
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.180]   to buy a certain product.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.180]   But if you're dealing with a traditional annuity,
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.500]   which is what most people say,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.020]   stay away from the exotic stuff.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.860]   Good advice, I think, generally speaking,
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.560]   but there may be exceptions for the sophisticated consumer.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.900]   A traditional annuity, there's just not much reason.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.700]   There aren't any contractual provisions that,
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.420]   man, if I just don't get this,
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.660]   then I'm not gonna get anything.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.460]   So think about that, but you're right in your point
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.500]   that the mortality tables have nothing to do
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.180]   with the age at which you buy the annuity.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.420]   It has everything to do with the mortality table
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.560]   that's printed and whether it goes to age 120 or 130.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.940]   - Gotcha, gotcha, understood.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.340]   I know you have another caller.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.660]   I don't know if you wanna take that one.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.020]   - We'll go with one quick one.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.020]   Yep, just pick one.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.520]   - Okay, let's see.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.620]   So I've been listening to your back catalog
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.860]   or re-listening to it a lot
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.540]   and gone through a lot of the talking
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.740]   that you've done before about your kids at different ages
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.060]   and what you are hoping to instill in them
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.540]   as far as values and work ethic and how to handle money
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.780]   and doing meaningful work and all that stuff.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.220]   I'm just curious if you have any update on that
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.180]   now that your kids are a little bit older
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.300]   and what you're implementing to give them,
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.100]   even things around the house, chores, allowances,
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.460]   how they, I heard one of your things
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.740]   when you were saying about always keep an investment fund
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.940]   and tell them never to let that go down.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.420]   Just curious to get a little update
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.340]   on where you're at on that now that your kids
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.620]   are a little bit older 'cause I'm getting to the age
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.900]   where I'm starting to try to implement
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.060]   some of this stuff myself
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.020]   and I think our kids have similar age ranges.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.980]   - Totally fair.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.420]   So I'll give some updates.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.420]   In general, I haven't changed many of my previous opinions.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.660]   So in general, the things that I've said previously
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.460]   about what I was doing and why I was doing it,
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.500]   I haven't yet changed many of those.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   The biggest change that I have made
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.540]   in the history of, over the course
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.780]   of radical personal finance is I have stopped
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.500]   being interested excessively in early child education.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.000]   I think that it is probably a good thing
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.580]   for those who can do it,
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.740]   but it's hard to do it with multiple children.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.360]   And so while I think that it can pay off
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.900]   the Domen method and early reading and all of that stuff,
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.340]   I think it can pay off.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.700]   I'm not convinced that it's all a fraud.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.100]   We just found that we were unable
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.420]   to stick with it effectively ourselves
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.380]   given our overall family dynamics
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.380]   and the number of children we have
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.060]   and their spacing, et cetera.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.620]   And I don't think that we are particularly,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.340]   I don't think that we're mistreating our children
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.860]   in that kind of situation.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.540]   I think that I've grown more confident
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.300]   in the fact that children,
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.820]   if given the right environment, can learn quickly.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.480]   So I have changed my opinion on early childhood education.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:14.100]   I've become convinced, increasingly convinced
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.200]   that unschooling and just a total
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.620]   child-directed education is not for me.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.160]   I never really thought it was,
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.600]   but I think that the unschoolers
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.480]   make some compelling arguments.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   But at the moment, I've become convinced
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.220]   that that's, I continue to believe
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.020]   that there's value in facing the discipline
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.900]   of generating academic structure and academic skills.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.880]   And so that's something where I continue to,
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.000]   I haven't changed much on that.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.620]   With regard to the financial side,
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.620]   I continue to give my children an allowance.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.840]   I teach them to divide the money into three categories.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.040]   I teach them to have an investing bag.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.620]   What has been very difficult though,
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.680]   and I've actually extended,
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.500]   I had planned that at seven,
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.460]   my previous plan was I was gonna give an allowance
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.740]   from three to seven.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.260]   And then my previous number was, okay,
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.200]   around seven, I think there's enough productive work
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.600]   that a child can do that I'll stop
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.140]   doing the allowance system.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.660]   I don't want to continue welfare in my family.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.440]   And so I figured, okay, I'll stop this with seven.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.420]   Our travels have gotten in the way of that.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.760]   So the constant movement, the travels,
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.420]   and then being in a foreign context
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.440]   has gotten in the way of that.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.200]   My wife and I have been talking about moving back
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.080]   to the United States,
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.800]   and there are many good reasons to do that.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.780]   If we did move back to the United States,
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.520]   one of the things that I would be happy for, again,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.540]   is to be back in a context where I know
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.440]   the dozens and dozens of things
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.720]   that my children can do to invest money.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.500]   I can, the dozens of things that they can do to earn money
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.240]   and to help them in some of those situations.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   Whereas right now, in an international context,
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.340]   it's much more, those things are much more difficult.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.000]   So I continue to believe that teaching children
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   to have savings, giving, saving money for spending,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.040]   investing money for growth,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.200]   and giving money really, really works.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.680]   I have increased an appreciation
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.360]   of how important academics are,
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.080]   just for the long-term future of children.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.380]   My seven-year-old is quite precocious,
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.440]   and he's often asking me, he's like,
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.600]   "Dad, I could just get a job,
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.880]   "and if I could do this and that,"
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.260]   and I continually find myself saying things
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.400]   that I would have been surprised a few years ago
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.040]   that I would have to say as much.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.280]   No, son, right now, I make plenty of money.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.500]   You don't need you to get a job.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.720]   What I need you to do is to focus on your schoolwork,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.880]   because academic achievement is gonna pay off far more
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.460]   in the long run for you than is just getting a job
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.560]   and having money.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.140]   That's a short-sighted, to run out and get a job
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.720]   and not focus on your academic skills
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.400]   is a short-sighted approach to life,
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.480]   and so that would have surprised me a number of years ago
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.340]   how much I needed to encourage that.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.640]   I continue to believe that,
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.860]   now, this is one that's gonna be tested in the coming years,
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.920]   but I continue to believe that I'm on the right track
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.220]   with the college planning
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.720]   and the way that I invest money in my children now,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.600]   rather than focusing on college savings.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.880]   I'm open.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.840]   One thing I have changed on is I'm open,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.080]   I'm more open to my paying for my children's
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.640]   college education and their academics
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.600]   than I previously was.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.360]   When I was in college, I was raised by parents
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.680]   who put themselves through college.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.120]   Well, my dad did, I'm not sure if my mom did.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.400]   My dad put himself through high school
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.600]   and he put himself through college.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.960]   I don't remember what the finances were
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.440]   for my mother's parents.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.280]   They were better off than my father's parents were,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.960]   so they may have paid for her school expense.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.240]   In fact, I expect they probably did.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.600]   But my father was an independent man
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.000]   and again, worked his way through high school,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.040]   went basically to a boarding high school
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.880]   and worked his way supporting his physical,
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.440]   his own needs through starting in the age of high school.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.720]   And they raised me with that mindset
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.240]   of contributing to the family and providing for that.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.960]   When I started to go to a private school in seventh grade,
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.520]   my father had me contribute $100 a month
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.520]   from my own earnings to the cost of that school.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.200]   Now, I actually need to go back and ask him why he did that.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.240]   I don't think it was because he needed the money,
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.080]   although finances were tight at the time
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.920]   because he was paying for, I think,
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.640]   four private school tuitions simultaneously.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.960]   But so maybe he needed the money.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.520]   I don't think it was because he needed the money.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.800]   I think it was more because he wanted me
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.840]   to have skin in the game.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.160]   'Cause I know he did the same thing with my siblings.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.560]   He wanted me to have skin in the game.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.720]   And I valued that.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.840]   I couldn't make those payments all the way through
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.760]   because of some stupid ways that I handled my money
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.960]   when I was in high school.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.080]   But I do value that I had skin in the game.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   And then I put myself through college.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.240]   What I have since come to realize is
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.900]   that there's a whole set of experiences
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.840]   that I never pursued when I was in college
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.400]   because I was so limited
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.560]   in needing to make money to pay for classes.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.520]   And at the time, I used to depreciate the value
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.480]   of those experiences and draw pride from my own personal,
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.040]   like, "Hey, I take care of myself
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.840]   "and I provide for myself."
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.740]   But in hindsight, I'm not sure that was the best move.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.320]   In hindsight, I realized that if I had done
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.480]   more interesting internships,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.200]   that could have led me in some very different directions
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.960]   in my career opportunities.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.520]   I never could understand why anybody would work for free.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.500]   I always needed to work and I needed to work for money.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.360]   And how could I afford to dedicate time to working for free?
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.580]   But at this point in time,
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.640]   I now see how those internships
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.420]   could have opened up to me very different experiences.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.800]   I also now see how I didn't follow a lot
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   of my personal interests in college
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.880]   that could have led to new
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.060]   and interesting career opportunities
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.860]   because I was so focused on earning money
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.440]   to pay for classes, pay for school,
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.360]   and pay for my living expenses.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.720]   And I now look at that and I wonder
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.560]   what it would have been like if I had had more free time.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.080]   Now, I'm not convinced one way or the other
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   because the reality is I squandered a lot of the free time
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.240]   that I did have.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.920]   I remember very distinctly the difference
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.360]   between my freshman year and my sophomore year.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.740]   My freshman year, I worked three jobs,
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.520]   I took a full load of classes,
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.240]   and I didn't borrow any money.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.520]   My sophomore year in college,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.860]   I decided I was working too much,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.320]   I stopped all my jobs,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.160]   I took out a bunch of student loans,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   and I dropped my class load down to the bare minimum.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.740]   I did terribly in school, I got terrible grades,
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.680]   and I don't really know what happened to that year.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.200]   I would imagine I had a lot of fun,
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.320]   but I don't actually know.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.840]   And I wasn't a drinker, so it's not that I can't remember,
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.300]   I just can't remember.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.440]   And so I look back at that and I was like,
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.720]   it could go both ways, right?
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.240]   You can have somebody whose parents
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.680]   provide everything for them,
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.040]   and they appreciate the benefits of that,
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.560]   and they are driven to make use of that
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   very special time in their lives.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.360]   On the other hand, you can have somebody
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.960]   whose parents give them everything,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.480]   and they're just totally entitled,
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.040]   and they waste their time.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.760]   And so I'm not convinced that it's strictly a matter
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   of paying for the child's expenses versus not.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.120]   I'm convinced that it's probably more a matter of character
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.680]   and the vision, et cetera.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.160]   So I'm more open today than I was five years ago
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.840]   on the idea of paying for children's education,
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.520]   and I haven't, and for extracurricular activities and such,
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.240]   and I haven't yet figured out kind of how would you know,
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.640]   how would you be able to assess the character of your child
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.360]   and figure out if what you're doing is good for him
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.960]   or bad for him.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.480]   A couple other things that are changing for me
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.840]   as my children get older,
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.200]   I'm appreciating more things like safety.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.840]   A number of years ago,
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.840]   I bought an old Toyota Corolla for $500,
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.720]   and I was super happy when I found it.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.760]   I bought it from a little old lady
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.880]   that just wanted to sell it and buy something different.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.960]   It had a manual transmission,
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.640]   and I bought it immediately 'cause I just loved it.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.120]   I was so excited about having this old car,
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.520]   because it was just dirt simple,
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.840]   and I figured I could always keep this around.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.400]   That way I have an extra car if I ever need one.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.280]   I can lend it to people, et cetera.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.320]   But then I was driving it down the highway one time,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.760]   and I realized, wait a second, why am I driving this car?
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.200]   If I get in a wreck in this car, that's a problem.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.320]   That's a major problem for me.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.040]   And I find the older I get,
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.480]   the more I realize my own physical frailty.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.840]   I used to, I've put so many roofs on houses,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.760]   but these days I would be hard-pressed
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.400]   to go and spend a ton of time up on the roof
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.240]   just out of the physical danger of it.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.720]   It's like, it's not worth it to me.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.280]   And so the same thing with the old car.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.660]   I kind of quit driving it and eventually sold it,
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.840]   'cause I thought no matter what this old car has,
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.560]   it doesn't have any of the modern safety features
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   that I find valuable.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.080]   So I think that by the time my children are of driving age,
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.220]   every car will have significant safety features.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.960]   But I now realize what I didn't realize when I was younger,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.440]   the importance of things like,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.680]   if your child is gonna drive,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.520]   them having a car that has modern safety features.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.480]   And if I were putting a 16-year-old on the road today,
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.520]   five years ago I would have said,
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.560]   oh, give them a little bit of money
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.120]   and let them pay for whatever they can find.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.680]   Well, I've changed that.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.200]   I think I didn't appreciate at the time
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.560]   how important things like safety are.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.920]   And if I had to put up the money or match the money,
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.640]   however we decided to do it when the time comes,
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   I want my child driving a car with excellent crash ratings,
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.000]   not a car that doesn't have any safety features.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.600]   So that would just be off the top of my head,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.320]   some things that I have changed.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.500]   So for the most part, not a lot of changes,
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.700]   but I'm very sensitive and I'm watching very carefully
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.320]   to see, okay, are my opinions right or wrong
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.780]   and what kind of feedback am I getting
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.020]   from my children, et cetera.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.280]   So I'll keep you in the loop as the years go by.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.040]   - I appreciate that, thanks.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.720]   Yeah, I think one of the more impactful things
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.360]   I've gotten from you over the years
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.700]   is just the idea of investing in the kids.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.480]   I tend to be a frugal person,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   but the whole idea of being okay with swiping a check
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.040]   or spending all this money on education,
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.480]   but not paying for certain experiences
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.000]   or whatever along the way just seems ridiculous.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.920]   So I've appreciated that mindset
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.080]   and just to get an update on the other stuff as well,
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.840]   it's been really helpful.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.680]   And we'll go to the back catalog,
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.240]   it's still a great resource,
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.800]   so I keep going through it.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.520]   - Thank you, appreciate that.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.720]   Yeah, it is, and that's definitely,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.080]   I didn't do, when I was younger,
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.960]   I didn't do a lot of the summer camps
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.080]   and all those things that many other children did,
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.400]   and I think it was due to the fact that we weren't wealthy.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.720]   And I don't regret it, we all have our own gain.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.960]   But now I look at it and I realize
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.800]   that how much of a benefit it can be
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.320]   for a child to be enrolled in a specific summer camp
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.640]   that's related to something that they're interested in,
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.520]   and for them to have a budget to explore
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.280]   the things that they're interested in.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   And I see how that knowledge and those interests
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.160]   when they're cultivated at young ages,
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.440]   I'm convinced it's really powerful.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.840]   So I think that most of us don't have to choose,
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.240]   most of us don't have to choose
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.000]   between doing one or the other.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.720]   Most of us can do, we can do both.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.360]   But if you have to choose between one or the other,
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.720]   I'm convinced that the biggest payoff
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.840]   comes of investing in the children when they are young.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.920]   We're going out to Anchorage, Alaska.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   Welcome to the show, I'm gonna serve you today.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.160]   - Hey Joshua, this is Ben.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.000]   - Ben, welcome.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.760]   - Thanks, I hope you and your family are well.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.020]   The question I have is, I've been thinking about,
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.520]   from your discussions and others
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.840]   about starting businesses and so on,
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.360]   but mulling over different ideas
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.040]   and I haven't really settled on anything.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.440]   But lately I've been thinking about
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.640]   the possibility of becoming a financial coach.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.000]   I was maybe wondering if your insights into that,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.640]   it's not really officially a credentialed,
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.280]   there are some quasi credentials out there,
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   mostly by people that are running courses
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.280]   on how to become one and start a business
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.320]   associated with it.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:22.200]   There's no official licensing involved or whatever.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.480]   You're just giving some generic advice to folks
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.680]   to help them get to the point where they could go
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.760]   to somebody that could help them,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.120]   that would require licensing,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.480]   like a financial advisor or so on.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.360]   So I kinda just wanted to get your general overview
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.040]   of what you think about financial coaching
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.180]   if you know much about it,
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.000]   and the process of starting a business
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.500]   and possibly a side business doing this.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.820]   - Let's start with this.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.540]   I work in some ways as a financial coach.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.760]   And the business that I have with Radical Personal Finance
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.740]   is in many ways an ideal coaching business.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.360]   I have multiple lines of revenue.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.920]   I don't maximize all of them,
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.800]   but I could sell advertising, right?
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.400]   I have patrons of the show, which I'm very grateful for.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.200]   I have people that sign up and support the show
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.780]   voluntarily with patronage.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.040]   I've previously sold advertising.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.840]   I sell digital courses that coach people
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.160]   on particular problems.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.700]   I have a number of long-term clients
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.480]   that I've worked with, exclusively entrepreneurs,
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.500]   because I enjoy working with entrepreneurs
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.820]   because I can make them a lot of money.
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.820]   And I offer a little bit of hourly consulting.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.400]   I recently, this last week, I recently redid that.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.660]   I haven't done any consulting in the last six months
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.500]   other than with my long-term clients,
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:51.100]   because it's a fairly low-profit margin business for me,
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.760]   compared to other things like selling courses and classes.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.580]   But I've decided to go ahead and start doing that again.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.600]   And so I recently revamped the coaching system,
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.940]   and it's available, I think, on the website now,
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:03.780]   where anybody who wants to can just go
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.480]   and book a consulting call with me,
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.020]   and I can make a lot of money doing that.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.120]   I charge $400 an hour for consulting,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.140]   and it's not hard for me to fill my schedule
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:16.960]   at this point in time.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.280]   I do it one day a week.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.020]   And so you can do the math.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:25.020]   If I do consulting for, usually I do 10 hours a day,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.980]   I do one day of 10 hours.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.500]   So if I do $400 an hour for 10 hours,
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.500]   that's $4,000 of revenue in one day.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.180]   If I do that 50 weeks a year,
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.820]   then there's $200,000 a year of revenue
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.380]   just simply from consulting.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.360]   And so you can run the math,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.460]   that that is obviously a doable business.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.700]   And what I do is exclusively consulting and coaching.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.900]   By the way, I just double-checked,
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.100]   my assistant had done this, I just double-checked.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.780]   The page is now up at radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.920]   So if you'd like a consultation with me,
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.340]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.240]   You can purchase, you can book right there,
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.100]   you can pay right there,
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.240]   you can choose your times, et cetera.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.780]   And so you can see from there that certainly,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.780]   with that perspective, coaching can be a viable business.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.940]   I can make exclusively from consulting, one day a week,
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:25.580]   I can do, I can make $200,000 of gross revenue,
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.700]   and it's basically, it's almost all profit
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.200]   based upon my business model.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.140]   And I'm a coach, I hold no licenses,
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.980]   I hold no, I don't have an insurance license,
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.340]   I don't have an investment license.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.780]   I'm exclusively an outside person
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.660]   who exclusively makes a living based upon my knowledge.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.100]   So on that, from that perspective,
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.820]   it's rather obvious that this is a business
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.880]   that can be done, that this is a very doable business,
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.220]   and you could make more, right?
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.660]   If you can bill at $400 an hour,
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:01.340]   and you can approach people,
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.460]   and you can, if you wanna fill 20 hours a week,
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.100]   you can do the math, right?
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:09.780]   Now, what is often missing from that is,
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.300]   well, how long did that take?
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.020]   Right, as we record this, it's October 23, 2020.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:20.620]   I have been a financial advisor since 2008,
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.460]   so that's 12 years of finance.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.180]   When I became a financial advisor,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.620]   I had been interested in and thinking about
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.240]   personal finance and financial planning
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.680]   for a very long time.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.940]   I read a huge amount on financial planning
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.700]   and the various theories and strategies and whatnot,
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   and I have since I was a kid.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.700]   I have, what, eight or nine professional-level
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.100]   industry credentials.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.340]   I'm a certified financial planner.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.660]   I'm a chartered life underwriter,
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.020]   a chartered financial consultant.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.580]   I'm a chartered advisor for senior living.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.420]   I have a registered health underwriter,
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.440]   which is about health insurance,
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.540]   a registered employee benefits consultant,
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.740]   and I have a master's degree,
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:10.080]   a legit actual master's degree in financial planning.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   In addition to that, I've recorded, what,
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.980]   coming on 800 episodes of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.660]   and so those 800 episodes of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:23.600]   that's a huge, a huge investment,
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.380]   and Radical Personal Finance is one of the largest
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.700]   personal finance podcasts in the marketplace.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.520]   I don't know, it's certainly not the largest.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.840]   That would probably be Dave Ramsey,
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.560]   but there are many good ones and many big ones,
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.760]   but it's one of the largest,
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.080]   and in the top 1% of podcasts.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.540]   Is that easy to create?
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.900]   It is not easy to create.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.200]   I don't know if I could do it today.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.640]   I'd like to think I could,
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   but I don't know if I could do it today,
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:55.280]   and so, and when you build that catalog of content,
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.160]   you know, you just heard John saying
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.660]   that he's going back and listening through.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.280]   John's listened to every episode I've done.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.140]   He's going back and listening through it again,
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.580]   and so when you build that back catalog of content,
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.720]   that's a really powerful thing to do,
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.960]   but it's not a get-rich-quick scheme, right?
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.840]   It's great to say, "Hey, I can make 4,000 bucks in a day,"
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.680]   and it's awesome.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.500]   I love it.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.440]   It's great, and I enjoy the work.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.640]   It's so fun to me.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.160]   I enjoy it, and it's a very valuable resource
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.240]   in the marketplace.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.660]   There is, I know of no other financial advisor
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.480]   with the knowledge and credentials that I have
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.680]   who gives any kind of hourly planning option
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.440]   in the way that I do, where I don't sell anything,
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.800]   and that's a tremendous resource for people
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.880]   because it gives people the opportunity to say,
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.720]   "I wanna get a second opinion.
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.600]   "You know, I'm gonna go meet with my financial advisor.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.680]   "I'm paying him $15,000 a year to manage my portfolio,
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.200]   "but I wanna get a second opinion,"
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.320]   and the things that I consult with people on
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.360]   are so wide-ranging that I frequently find myself saying,
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.900]   "Without any fear of error,
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.020]   "I think I'm the only person in the world
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.760]   "who actually can give you the answers
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.180]   "on this particular thing," and it covers the gamut.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:07.140]   It goes from how to maximize the profitability of a business
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.980]   to how to flee the country,
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.780]   and I'm not exaggerating with that,
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.300]   and so I don't know of anybody else in the business.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.120]   Maybe they're out there.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.480]   I know of many people who are better than I am
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.600]   with specific technical consultations.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.940]   For example, if it comes to estate planning,
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.780]   I just tell people, I'll give someone an overview
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.700]   to say, "Let's talk about the big picture,"
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.220]   but I send 'em to an estate planning attorney
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.940]   because your average, everyday, run-of-the-mill
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.980]   estate planning attorney knows more about estate planning
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.900]   in your state than I do, but I'm fully qualified.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.880]   I don't have the credential, but I'm fully qualified
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.660]   for the accredited estate planner credential,
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:50.140]   and so the point is that it cannot be built.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.020]   Without question, it can be built.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.660]   Can I tell you that you can build it?
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.780]   I'm not so confident in that
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:02.780]   because I know what has gone into my being able to do this,
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:07.180]   and I'm not convinced that most other people
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:11.300]   want to do or could do what I do
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.580]   because it's the output of a very long time.
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.740]   Now, if you say, "I've got a five-year plan
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.460]   "or a 10-year plan, and I wanna be knowledgeable in that,"
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.480]   yes, absolutely, it can do that,
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.860]   but if you say, "I've got a six-month plan
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.340]   "or a one-year plan," I'm not so sure.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.260]   You can become a world-class expert in anything
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.620]   in a year or two, right, a year or two of reading,
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.820]   but most people don't do it.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:36.180]   They're not willing to do that, and so it's hard,
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.220]   and then to make yourself stand out,
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.900]   and the media space is very full,
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.060]   to make yourself stand out, it's very difficult,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.800]   so what I don't think works generally
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.420]   with financial coaching, I don't think
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.920]   that financial coaching works at the low end.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.180]   My average consulting client, I have a number of,
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.420]   I do have a number of clients who,
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:00.580]   I've consulted with some people who don't make six figures,
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.520]   and I applaud them, and I actually encourage them,
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.820]   and I work my tail off so that when they leave
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.020]   a consulting call with me, with 60 Minutes of Me,
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.020]   they've got way more than they could ever have dreamed of,
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.740]   because I feel a huge responsibility
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.200]   when people who don't earn six figures sit down and say,
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.620]   "I'm gonna invest money into myself in this particular way,"
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.420]   but my average client makes several hundred thousand dollars
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:26.980]   per year, it's not uncommon for me to speak on the phone
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:31.980]   with, if I do a 10-hour day, it's not uncommon to me
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.740]   that at least five of the 10 will be multi-millionaires,
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.340]   because that's the audience that I have
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.140]   at Radical Personal Finance, and so that's
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.700]   a very different audience, that's a very different
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.680]   marketplace than the marketplace for somebody
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.700]   who says, "I'm gonna do budget coaching,"
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.660]   or, "I'm gonna help you get out of debt," or something,
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.660]   which is what I think most people think of
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.820]   when they think of coaching, and the reason I'm specifying
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.620]   this is what has been frustrating to me over the years,
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.100]   is I have learned through hard-won experience
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.740]   that most people who are poor don't care
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.960]   very much about money.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:12.940]   Most people who are rich care a lot about money,
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.660]   and it's maddening to me, because I look at that
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.580]   and I say, "You're poor, you're broke,
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.220]   why do you not care about your money?
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.540]   Why are you not willing to do anything?
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:27.060]   Why are you not willing to read a book, go to a seminar,
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.460]   sit with a financial advisor?
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.820]   Why, why, why, why are you so pig-headed
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.260]   to not realize that you're broke and poor
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.300]   because you're uninterested in money?"
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.240]   And yet I have, I don't wanna say without exception,
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:45.580]   but I have found it ineffably difficult
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:50.580]   to actually change somebody's mind and opinion around that.
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:55.460]   And when I was a baby-faced financial advisor,
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.780]   I remember so many times I'd wind up in this,
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.540]   I'd get referred to some guy who was a nice guy,
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.540]   and I'd wind up in this single wide trailer,
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:06.540]   or this little room somewhere,
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.620]   and I would take people with me,
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:12.060]   more experienced financial advisors and joint work people,
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.780]   and they would sit there and they would stare at me.
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.580]   And I would sit there for an hour with somebody
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.220]   who was broke and poor,
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.980]   and my poor joint work people would come along
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.460]   and they would just sit there.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.180]   And we would leave the appointment and they would say,
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.020]   "Joshua, why on earth did you not get up
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.300]   and leave after five minutes?"
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.300]   And I was like, "But they need me, they're broke,
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.120]   they're poor."
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.440]   And they would say, "They're broke and they're poor,
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.940]   they're obviously not gonna do anything,
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.620]   why did you waste an hour of your time?
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.820]   Go and do something that you enjoy doing with."
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:40.200]   And I thought it was cold-hearted and wrong,
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.020]   and I used to think, "But I can do it, right?
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.580]   I can change somebody, I can make somebody want it,
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.260]   this person's living in a single wide trailer
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.260]   on the bad side of town,
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.380]   and I know that I can make a difference in their life."
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   And speaking today,
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.160]   I couldn't give you a list of five people
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.100]   that I ever made a difference in their life that way,
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.580]   even though I wanted to and I tried to.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.620]   And so what I think a lot of people think of
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.700]   when they think of financial coaching is,
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.460]   I'm gonna help people do budget coaching,
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.060]   I'm gonna charge them 50 bucks an hour.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.340]   And I don't think that business works.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.460]   Maybe there's somebody out there who's doing it,
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.620]   but I just don't think it works,
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.320]   I couldn't make a living that way.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.900]   I think that maybe there's somebody out there
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.900]   who's doing coaching and they say,
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.700]   "Well, I'm gonna help people get out of debt."
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.460]   You're not gonna do it, right?
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.980]   They need Dave Ramsey's radio show and book, right?
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.140]   They don't need a coach in general.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.340]   Now, I'm sure there are people out there who would say,
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.380]   "But I've done it."
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.300]   And I would encourage you to listen to their stories
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.020]   and see, but the most profitable thing
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.820]   that most financial coaches are gonna do
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.780]   is sell a course on how to become a financial coach.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.540]   That's the most profitable thing that most people do.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.260]   And so I wanna give you though,
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.940]   a couple of business models that I do think work.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.500]   Number one, if you can work at the high end,
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.380]   I think it's possible to do high end coaching.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.540]   If you have the credentials and the knowledge and the skill,
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.380]   and you can figure out how to attract wealthy people,
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.620]   I think it's absolutely possible.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.900]   But that's gonna need some skill and some knowledge
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:20.220]   and some experience and some marketing savvy.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.180]   What I think is very sellable,
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.020]   if radical personal finance collapsed,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.420]   and I just needed to make money,
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.700]   and I needed to make money with my skillset,
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.300]   and I needed to make money in an area that I thought
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.860]   I could leverage the niche opportunity,
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.540]   I would build a social security consulting business.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.500]   And I would build people,
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.020]   I would become an expert on social security,
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.380]   and I would build people for an hourly rate
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.340]   or a package deal to tell them when
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.020]   and how they should take advantage of social security,
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.180]   and answer all their social security problems.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.660]   And I use that as a model,
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.100]   whereas I would say that this is, I think,
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.700]   a good kind of model to pursue.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.540]   Why?
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.360]   What does it require?
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.500]   Well, first of all, social security planning
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.020]   requires specialized knowledge,
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.020]   but it's not that difficult to acquire.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.580]   I think that three, four months,
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:20.180]   you could become a leading expert on social security.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.460]   There are many good books written,
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.040]   you could read the legislation,
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.340]   you could read all of the
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.500]   social security administration documents,
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.760]   and in about three to four months,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.540]   you could be an expert on social security planning.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.740]   But it's an area that's very dense to most people.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.720]   And so that subject matter expertise
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.440]   is, I think, a really good way to differentiate yourself.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.800]   Number two, the people that you're dealing with,
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   you're dealing with people who have big financial assets.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.840]   And here I'm talking about social security.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.600]   Social security is a huge asset for an ordinary worker.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.840]   It's, for most people,
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.120]   the single most valuable asset they have.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.760]   And teaching them how to optimize it
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.140]   and how to approach it is, in my opinion,
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.700]   one of the best things that you can do,
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.020]   because if they get it right,
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.220]   you can add tens of thousands of dollars to their life.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.300]   If you get it wrong,
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.840]   they could potentially be walking away
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.700]   from tens of thousands of dollars.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.760]   And so you wanna deal with areas
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.660]   where you can make a big impact.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.400]   If you're gonna charge big dollars,
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.760]   you need to be able to make a big impact,
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.860]   which is why helping somebody with budget coaching
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.860]   is not it.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.620]   If you help somebody with budget coaching,
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.880]   you say, "Listen, I'm gonna help you save money
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.760]   "on your cell phone bill by switching from Verizon wireless
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.760]   "to this MVNO over here."
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.940]   Does that help them?
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.720]   Yeah, but they're gonna save a little bit of money
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.780]   and they're gonna have a hard time justifying it.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.420]   But if you wanna go after big dollars for you,
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.660]   you need to be able to make big dollar changes
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.660]   in the lives of your clients,
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.020]   which is why for my long-term consulting clients,
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.700]   I only work with entrepreneurs,
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.020]   because I can't make that much of a difference
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.740]   in an employee's life.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.140]   I can make a little difference,
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.220]   but the changes generally come more slowly.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.700]   And a lot of the changes are gonna be disruptive, right?
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.980]   The way that the average employee can make more money
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.300]   is go and get a better job.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.140]   Well, that's disruptive.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.240]   And a lot of people, that's not something they're doing.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.580]   But an entrepreneur,
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.200]   I can come into an entrepreneur's life
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.980]   and every year we can double the business.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.420]   Every year we can triple the business.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.620]   And so now my consulting fees, which are hefty,
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.540]   are always, I'm always painting them.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.780]   And I'm saying, look, we added $600,000 of revenue
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.960]   to your business last year.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.060]   Do you feel so bad now about my fees, right?
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.460]   And you always need to parallel and foil and contrast
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.660]   your fees and the cost of your work
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.800]   as compared to the benefit and the upside.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.540]   And you can't do that with budget coaching.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.020]   You can't do that with get out of debt coaching.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.540]   You can do that with social security coaching.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:53.700]   And then in addition to that,
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.020]   you're dealing when you're dealing with social security,
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.740]   you're more, and the kind of person
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.620]   who's likely to book a consultation,
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.780]   you're dealing at the upper end of the wealth market.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.560]   You're serving the wealthy, not the poor.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.900]   The poor are not gonna come and buy a consultation
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.540]   on how they can maximize their social security.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.140]   A number of years ago, I had a friend of mine
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:16.340]   who had never made more than just a little bit of money,
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.060]   very basic work, had spent years being unemployed,
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.900]   had declared bankruptcy and had gotten a job,
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.980]   but then had gotten laid off from his job.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.620]   He was in his early 60s
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.180]   and he just didn't know what to do.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.300]   And so he decided he was gonna go
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.540]   and file for social security.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.180]   And I begged with him, I pleaded with him.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:39.140]   I said, "Listen, let me explain to you."
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.340]   And I showed him, I tried every way I could.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.780]   I said, "If you file for social security early
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.880]   "versus if you file at 70,
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.760]   "this is the single biggest thing that you can do
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.000]   "is work for the next seven years.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.560]   "I cannot overemphasize how important it is
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.700]   "for you to wait until at least full retirement age,
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:03.700]   "if not 70, in order to file for social security."
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.800]   I tried, I tried, I tried.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.940]   I gave the guy $400 an hour advice for nothing.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.340]   I broke all my rules
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.300]   about giving people financial advice for free,
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.020]   and I did it, and it did nothing.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.860]   He filed for social security and I told him,
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.540]   I said, "You are going to be broke
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.680]   "because you've got this tiny social security payment
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.380]   "because you're taking it so early.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.200]   "And what's happening is you're doing it
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.340]   "in a time of stress.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.660]   "You're doing it because you got laid off from a job
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.780]   "and you don't have the desire or the energy
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.720]   "or the wherewithal to go and get another job.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.240]   "And so this is never gonna get better.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.760]   "For the rest of your life,
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.300]   "you are going to be living like a miser
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.260]   "and completely stuck.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.340]   "Because if you think your self-confidence is bad now,
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.380]   "just wait four years."
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.760]   Well, fast forward about four or five years.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.000]   That guy, my friend, and I want to be clear,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.920]   he's still my friend, but that guy,
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.700]   he sits at home, he watches Netflix all day long,
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:02.000]   and to this day, he is completely stuck
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.420]   in his living situation.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.900]   He can't get another car,
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.140]   he's not willing to change anything,
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.900]   he's got everything is breaking down in his life,
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.680]   he's stuck in a place that he hates living
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.380]   'cause it's the only place he can find that's cheap enough,
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.940]   and it's just a nightmare.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.180]   He's got no opportunity, no future,
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.300]   and it's all because of social security.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.780]   He chose social security early
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.420]   and has no confidence enough to get a job,
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.940]   nothing that he knows that he could do,
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.080]   nothing that he's qualified to do,
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.320]   and at this point in time,
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.200]   after sitting and watching Netflix nonstop for years,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.880]   he doesn't have the personal motivation to do anything.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.000]   So these kinds of things matter,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.600]   but yet, my point in that little tangent
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.440]   was simply to say that poor people,
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.020]   they won't pay you for advice,
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.400]   and they won't take your advice when you give it to them.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.560]   So you need to be working with people who are wealthy,
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.240]   and something like social security consultations,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.400]   the people who are gonna buy that
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.520]   are gonna be people who are wealthy,
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.920]   who understand that, hey, if I just pay an expert,
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.900]   you know, 400 bucks or 250 bucks
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:56.540]   or whatever your price is that you wind up in,
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.980]   if I pay an expert for a couple hours of their time,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.060]   they'll answer all my questions for me,
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.900]   and they'll help me maximize things,
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.140]   and then I'll sleep well at night
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.460]   knowing that I have maximized
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.060]   my social security contributions.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.220]   And then finally, the thing about something
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.860]   like a social security consultation business
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:12.980]   is that that's the kind of business
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.700]   that's easily marketable.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:19.100]   It'll be attractive in marketing, right?
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.260]   If you put a newspaper ad for social security seminar,
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.280]   you'll get people to show up.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.480]   If you put a newspaper ad for get out of debt seminar,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.560]   if you get people to show up,
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.720]   they'll be the wrong people to show up,
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.320]   they won't have any money.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.460]   But if you advertise for social security seminar,
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.260]   they'll have the money and they'll show up.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.260]   In addition to that, it's the kind of business
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.120]   that works really well as being compatible
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.880]   with other kinds of businesses.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.300]   So how would I market it
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.720]   if I became a social security consultant?
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.600]   What would I do?
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.920]   Well, I'll go to every financial advisor in town,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.080]   and I would say, listen, let's put on a seminar
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.380]   for your clients or your prospective clients
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.540]   on social security planning.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.140]   And I'll present to your clients
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.240]   and to your prospective clients,
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.500]   I'll present to them the latest and the greatest
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.280]   and the very best social security strategies
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.860]   as to how they can maximize their social security benefits.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:11.540]   And the advisors will pay you for it
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.820]   or they'll do it with them as a joint operation.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.920]   They'll cover the costs of the seminar.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.620]   Their clients will be happy to come,
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.640]   happy to bring their friends.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   The advisors will win because they'll have exposure
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.480]   to new prospective clients,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.280]   and you'll win because you'll have exposure
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.340]   to new prospective clients.
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.740]   And something like that, it's perfect
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.960]   because you can give away all of the latest and greatest
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.900]   and best cutting edge strategies.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.060]   You can give them all away at the seminar
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.580]   without any fear of that limiting your exposure.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.340]   Because will there be one in a hundred
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.760]   who's that guy who says, wow, okay,
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.200]   now I'm gonna go and read all the books
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.180]   that Ben told me I should read?
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.480]   Yeah, there's one in a hundred.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.840]   But the other 99 recognize that,
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.400]   ah, if there's this many great strategies
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.120]   that he's giving away for free,
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.260]   there must be even more better strategies
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.280]   that if he were looking at my situation,
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.260]   he could tell me what I qualify for.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.360]   And they'll sign up and you'll fill your calendar with that.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.560]   So it's easily marketable.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.120]   So something like that is the way to go,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.200]   not with, okay, I'm a financial consultant
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.600]   and budget consulting, but rather something like,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.040]   I am a social security consultant
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.700]   and then I'll make one last point.
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:24.720]   Given all of that, if I were starting over again
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.640]   and I were interested in finances,
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.000]   I don't think, I'm not sure that I would go
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.060]   with the consultant route,
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.480]   unless it offered you some specific things that you wanted.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.880]   So why do I like consulting?
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.080]   Well, number one, I don't like consulting.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.720]   I like selling digital courses
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.660]   because they're infinitely scalable.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.840]   I can create something one time
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.800]   and then I can sell it to thousands.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.320]   And it doesn't matter whether there's thousands of people
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.640]   who buy it or one person that buys it,
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.420]   I have the same time invested.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.520]   So it's infinitely scalable.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.320]   In addition, I love it because that kind of work
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.840]   has a high payoff.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.120]   That kind of work, if I provide the right value,
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.600]   it's a very, very profitable business.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.620]   That's one of the reasons why I don't like doing consulting
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.240]   because when I do consulting,
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.520]   I can make $400 an hour, which is wonderful.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.360]   I love it.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.180]   I'm thrilled.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.020]   It's great.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.920]   I'm very blessed to be able to do that.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.060]   But I can make $4,000 an hour with my other work.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.520]   And so there's always this trade-off
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.920]   is that why should I do consulting
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.460]   when I can do this other work?
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.960]   And so consulting fundamentally,
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.620]   especially hourly consulting,
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.180]   fundamentally has the problem
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.580]   of it being a one-to-one sale of time.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.100]   And you're always stuck in this linear model.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.620]   Now, that can give you certain benefits.
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:39.620]   So for example,
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.480]   if you want the ability to travel the world,
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.720]   well, consulting can offer that.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.580]   If you want the ability to live anywhere you want,
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.440]   if you want the ability to work on your own time schedule,
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.120]   consulting can offer that.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.500]   If you want the ability to do all your work virtually,
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.540]   consulting can offer that.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.500]   So there are a lot of benefits
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.180]   of building a consulting business.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.960]   But a lot of benefits that you would get
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.880]   from building a consulting business,
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.480]   I think are better achieved
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.400]   in the traditional financial services model.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.840]   If I went broke today
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.460]   and I couldn't do radical personal finance,
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.360]   would I start the social security consulting business?
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.480]   Maybe if I had something else exciting as well.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.880]   But if I were gonna live in one place,
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.600]   I would go get a life insurance license
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.580]   and I would sell life insurance.
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.820]   I used to be embarrassed about selling life insurance.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.100]   When I was a new life insurance agent,
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.380]   I was like, I wanna do financial planning.
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.320]   I wanna manage money.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.380]   'Cause I thought selling life insurance was unglamorous.
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.540]   Today, I could happily do nothing but sell life insurance.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.340]   And I think I would make infinitely more money
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.760]   selling life insurance
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.380]   than I would doing social security consulting.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.000]   And the life insurance business model
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.700]   is in so many ways a superior business model.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.240]   Because now you have much higher commission rates.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.980]   You sell $1,000 a year life insurance policy
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.600]   to an average, not exactly a well,
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.840]   $1,000 a year term life insurance policy.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.340]   That's $1,000 commission.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.440]   In other words, $900, $1,100,
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.160]   depending on what company you're dealing with.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.240]   Right, it's a significant commission.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.640]   Maybe some companies have lower first year commission rates,
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.480]   but you're dealing with $600 to $1,200
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.480]   of first year commission
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.080]   for selling a $1,000 term life insurance policy.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.280]   You could sell $1,000 term life insurance policies easily
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.200]   because they're just so necessary.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.560]   They're so valuable.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.520]   And there's so many people
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.120]   who don't have the proper term insurance that they need.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.240]   Disability insurance, health insurance,
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.600]   long-term care insurance.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.440]   All of these create significant upfront commissions
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.360]   that you can sell to more people.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.200]   And all of them create renewal income.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.840]   And renewal income is one of the most valuable things
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.440]   you can possibly cultivate.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.320]   Because in the social security seminar world or that world,
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.360]   you're always one-to-one,
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.920]   you're always selling your time for dollars,
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.280]   time for dollars, time for dollars.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.760]   And if you stop selling your time, the dollars stop.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.160]   But if you do something like build an insurance portfolio
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.860]   of life insurance sold,
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:02.080]   then you can always know what your renewal commissions are.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.600]   So you get into it a few years,
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.320]   and now you know I've got $50,000 of income
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.520]   coming in this year for my renewal commissions.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.120]   And I don't have to do much for that.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.640]   And the business gets easier,
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.080]   because now you do repeat sales,
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.760]   and it expands out,
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.680]   and you add other lines of product, et cetera.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.760]   And so I think that there's often this jump from people,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.960]   I watched this happen last week
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.320]   in a personal finance group online,
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.280]   where somebody's looking at the,
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.400]   somebody's thinking about going
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.480]   into the financial services business.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.480]   And they say, "Well, should I go
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.720]   "into the financial services business?"
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.240]   And everybody says, "Well, no, you're gonna sell your soul,
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.060]   "and you're just doing it for commission, et cetera."
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.880]   There are major ethical questions
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.840]   that you have to deal with in financial services.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.240]   No question.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.640]   I think they're major ethical questions in any business.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.580]   And I think that if the majority of people
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.580]   who wanna be consultants would just simply go
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.920]   into the traditional financial services business,
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.000]   I think the opportunities there are much, much bigger,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.960]   and the business model is proven.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.480]   And as best I can see,
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.320]   there's not a lot that's changed
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.440]   or is changing in the model.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.720]   So can you sell seminars online?
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.560]   You can.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.800]   But you can also sell a lot more life insurance
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.360]   than seminars, and it's just a much more stable business.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.840]   Because people can get coaching anywhere,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.880]   but if they're gonna get insurance,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.520]   they gotta go to an insurance agent.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.200]   And why shouldn't that insurance agent be you?
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.800]   So long answer to your question, Ben,
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.480]   but that's how I would think through the problem,
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.960]   and those are my responses.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.320]   Helpful thoughts, comments?
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.280]   - Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.800]   Certainly an in-depth look at things.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.540]   And yeah, to me, initial thoughts about it
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.340]   are just to be a coach and maybe help
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.740]   local community stuff.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.160]   I don't need to do this as a career or a job.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.140]   My current one is pretty good,
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.540]   and it's not gonna change, hopefully.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.780]   It'd be maybe church stuff, help folks in church and so on.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:54.700]   But you've certainly given me some more things
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.500]   to think about, and I appreciate your in-depth answer.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.700]   - Yeah, if I were gonna do that,
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.780]   I don't think I would charge for the time.
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.460]   If you're gonna give it away as a service,
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.880]   then I would just say give it away as a service.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.320]   And I think that people, there's no question
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.240]   that people who are in need,
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.200]   people who are in a difficult situation
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.360]   can benefit from having somebody that comes along
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.800]   and that says, "Hey, will you help me?"
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.400]   And they sit down and help.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.880]   There's so many people who,
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.020]   in a church group where somebody says,
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.300]   "Listen, why don't you come over to my house
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.120]   "and I'll help you make a budget?"
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.160]   That's super, super valuable.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.420]   And I don't wanna discount or depreciate
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.660]   the value of that work.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.700]   That's what we should do is help people
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.060]   when they're asking for help.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.620]   Although there may be many poor people who won't do anything,
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.100]   there are lots of poor people, there are poor people
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.900]   who will say, "Hey, I wanna change my life
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.860]   "and I need some help."
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.080]   My comments are mostly in the line of
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.700]   how do you build a business on it?
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:52.980]   And so if you wanna build a business on it,
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.860]   those are my comments.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.740]   All right, we had four callers jump on here,
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:57.660]   so I guess I'm gonna have to go quick.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.100]   If I'm gonna get everyone, I may not get everyone.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.120]   So we go now to Kentucky.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.340]   How can I serve you today?
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:07.200]   Kentucky.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.840]   All right, we'll come back to Kentucky.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.060]   We'll go to Denver, Colorado.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:13.900]   Denver, welcome to the show.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.920]   How can I serve you today?
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.460]   - Hi, Joshua.
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.280]   I'm actually in Texas now.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.520]   - All right, welcome to Texas then.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.600]   - Thank you.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.480]   So my question touches the last one in some ways,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.600]   but I'm kind of already headed down the path
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.340]   of traditional financial services.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.160]   So I really wanna know, and I appreciate your wisdom
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.320]   and your experience in that industry,
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.960]   but I really wanna try to get some guidance
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.080]   on what is the best next step for me.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.920]   So I'm currently involved in a career transition.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.400]   Been a paraplaner for a financial advisor
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.240]   for the last several months.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.140]   Prior to that, I was an engineer for 12 years.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:57.720]   I wanna take the next step to be an advisor.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.960]   Financial planning, I think that's the way
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.760]   that I wanna go into financial services.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.720]   And I've been looking for opportunities
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.400]   that could get me closer to that.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.280]   I've called a lot of RIAs.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.760]   I'm just looking for a junior advisor,
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.880]   service advisor type role.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.760]   I get a few bites there.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.960]   Those typically are the kind of role
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.040]   where I would be working under someone more experienced
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   and then splitting fees and commissions with the RIA.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.560]   I'm also in some early conversations
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.560]   with a very huge investment company
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.720]   who everybody knows because usually their 401(k)
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.240]   is with them.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.880]   And I see that as a potential option
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.320]   because great training there, a lot of volume,
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.920]   people just walk in the door.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.320]   And so I could learn a lot fast.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.720]   But my concern is that if I get to the point
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.800]   where I wanna have my own business,
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.700]   I'll have to leave and start all over when the time comes.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.360]   Do you have any thoughts for me there
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.240]   just as far as what the right path could be?
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.160]   - How old are you?
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.480]   - 33.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:21.360]   - So at 33 years old, you should have more self-awareness
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.920]   than younger men about kind of what you like to do,
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.880]   what you don't like to do, where you would be good,
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.480]   where you wouldn't be good, et cetera.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.000]   And I think that's important to notice that
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.080]   because your perspective, I'm convinced
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.640]   that there is a place in the financial services industry
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.440]   for almost any kind of personality type,
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.120]   for almost any kind of person.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.020]   But it often takes a little while to find it
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.920]   because different firms are structured
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.960]   in different directions.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.520]   And some firms work well with one personality type
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.560]   and some firms don't work well.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.720]   And so the first thing I would encourage you
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.040]   is don't see it as a bad thing
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.980]   if you'd wind up bouncing around the business a little bit.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.080]   Bouncing around a little bit is common.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.760]   And I think it's common for this reason
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.220]   is you have to find what kind of scenario do I like.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.920]   If you're very technical and you enjoy the knowledge
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.960]   of financial planning, you enjoyed working
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.020]   as a paraplanner, you can find room for that.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.920]   It's often, in my opinion,
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.560]   it's a much lower compensated skillset
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.640]   than the skillset of being a rainmaker,
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:30.060]   of being able to go out and find clients and bring them in.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.320]   But it's a very important skillset
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.160]   and it can work really, really well
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.520]   to buttress somebody's firm,
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.120]   but you've got to find the right solution.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.280]   And I don't know how to tell you how to do that.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.440]   Taking a job with a large firm
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.520]   where it's more of a salary type job,
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.840]   more of an employment type job can be wonderful.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.920]   And I think for many people, it's a much better fit
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.000]   than being out in the field making sales.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.320]   It gives you the opportunity
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:03.760]   to earn more income in the beginning.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.500]   It gives you an opportunity to not have to worry
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.960]   about chasing down leads,
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.480]   not have to worry about figuring out
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.040]   where am I gonna get new clients?
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.200]   How am I gonna advertise my services?
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.160]   Do I have to talk to my friends about investments, et cetera?
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:20.160]   It's a good situation for the right personality type.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.400]   I personally, there've been many days where I'm like,
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.760]   hey, that would be really good.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.220]   Get to talk about money, get paid a salary for it.
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.800]   But most days I would be frustrated
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.600]   because I would say I could be making quadruple the money
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.600]   if I would just build myself in a different skillset.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.720]   And so I think it's important to look at that.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.920]   Now, as I see it,
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.480]   there are a couple different things to look at.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.640]   There is, I used to divide this
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.080]   into basically three categories.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.240]   I used to divide this into number one, the salesman,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.480]   the guy who's going out, building relationships,
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.760]   prospecting, bringing people in to talk about money.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.120]   The technical planner, usually a back office,
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.480]   maybe what you were doing before.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.480]   Most firms at this point in time
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.200]   will try to hire somebody who's very technically competent
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.120]   and they'll keep that guy busy with a sales team
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.760]   of people out there bringing in clients.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.620]   And he's the guy who sits in the office.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.680]   He comes to the client meetings,
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.540]   explains the details of the financial plan,
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.120]   but he's not the relationship guy.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:21.960]   And then there's various
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.320]   administrative support functions as well.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.440]   That's how I used to do it.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.180]   I'm not sure if that still holds true.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:31.160]   There've been a lot of changes in the financial business
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.640]   since I left it in 2014.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.040]   And so I wanna caution you to look around
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.680]   and talk to people.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.560]   But I am convinced that if you're as young as you are,
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.280]   at 33, and if you really want to do it,
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.920]   you owe it to yourself to try to be
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:52.920]   a front end relationship builder, a front end salesman.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.920]   Because if you do that, and if you have that skill,
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.440]   and that's married with your technical
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.240]   financial planning knowledge, if you have that skill,
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.760]   that's where you're gonna make the most money
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.840]   and have the most freedom.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.760]   And you can have control over yourself and over your life.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:13.000]   To me, that's always been worth it.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.280]   Especially now, if I started today,
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.640]   when I started at 23, I was very insecure.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.040]   I was nervous, I was nervous to pick up the phone.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.100]   If I went back today into that business model,
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.320]   I could rebuild in two years what I did,
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.540]   what I previously, took me six years to build.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.320]   I could do it more in two years,
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.080]   just by being more mature and more confident in who I am,
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.760]   and in what I know, et cetera.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.520]   And I think that that's the case for many people.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.760]   Now, at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself,
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.280]   do I like, could I learn to pick up the phone?
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.560]   Could I learn to go and be someone
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.760]   who's building relationships and bringing in
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.100]   prospective clients and doing their financial plans
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:53.940]   for them?
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:58.280]   I love the-- - I think so.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.560]   - Yeah, so if so, then what I would say is that
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.100]   I would interview around with some firms
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.800]   where you're going to have an opportunity
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.960]   to be on a front-end scenario.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.800]   Now, I wanna be careful 'cause I try to keep the show
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.440]   fairly clean of companies and whatnot,
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.360]   'cause I'm just not involved in that.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.760]   But you owe it to yourself to interview around the business
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.900]   and look at some of the different models.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:23.000]   There are benefits and drawbacks to almost any model.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.500]   You could start your own RIA today, right?
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:30.120]   You could file the paperwork, you could write your ADV.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.540]   I've done it, you could do it,
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.920]   and you could start your firm.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.680]   You could start your firm and ally with a certain model.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.520]   Years ago, I had Alan Moore on the show
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.680]   and we talked about X, Y, P, and advisors.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.280]   That was right when Radical Personal Finance
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.120]   was when they were started.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.080]   They've grown massively, kind of supporting young,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.920]   primarily young, which you would still qualify,
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.280]   but young financial advisors who wanna set up
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.220]   their own independent fee-only financial planning firm.
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.240]   I think that's fine.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.120]   I think that's fair.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:05.260]   There are the big kind of traditional wire house names
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:07.620]   and you can get a start with many of them.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.340]   That will depend on your marketplace, right?
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.780]   If you start with one of the big wire house names,
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.820]   you're gonna have a certain number of AUM
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:17.940]   that you're expected to bring in.
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:19.420]   And if you don't hit it, you're gonna have trouble.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.300]   But if you can bring in that AUM,
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.180]   then you're gonna be in good shape.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.700]   I'm still in favor of the model that I started with,
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.000]   which was insurance.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   If I might, if I shut down Radical Personal Finance today,
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.240]   that's just how I always think, what would I do?
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.240]   Well, I would be frustrated with the idea
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.560]   that I couldn't create media.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.160]   I've seen the power of being able to create media.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.920]   And I would think very, very carefully
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.440]   about going ahead and starting my own independent RIA
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.600]   so that I could have control over media
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.000]   and I could take advantage of what I'm doing right now.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.600]   And I would probably go in that direction
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.320]   because I'm good at creating media.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.440]   But if I weren't 100% convinced
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.040]   that I was good in that direction,
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.920]   I would start a hybrid practice
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.820]   where I focused on selling insurance in the beginning
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.880]   and then investments and investment management
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.840]   on the backside and financial planning on the backside.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.520]   The reason is, here are the reasons why I would do that.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.000]   Number one, there are far more people out there
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.720]   who need more insurance than there are
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.480]   who want you to manage their money.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.440]   The vast majority of people are underinsured
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.120]   compared to what you would sit down as a planner
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.760]   and say that they should do.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.680]   And they need insurance.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.640]   And you can make a very viable business
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:42.960]   doing nothing more than selling term life insurance.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.300]   If you are a good financial planner
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.100]   and you're able to articulate the case
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.720]   for term life insurance, for disability insurance,
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.880]   and then a little bit of long-term care insurance
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.580]   here and there, that opens up a world to you
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:59.280]   where you can make plenty of money there
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.800]   with good insurance protection
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.680]   that's every bit iron tough, it just works.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.880]   If you add on whole life insurance
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.360]   or universal life insurance
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.840]   in the situations where it's appropriate,
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.320]   you can add a substantial amount of money
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.520]   to your annual commission revenue.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.220]   And the nice thing about life insurance revenue
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:22.000]   is that it all comes in up front, right?
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.160]   You have your first year commissions
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.280]   that are paid many times
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.520]   while the case is still in underwriting.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.260]   If it's been conditionally approved.
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:29.820]   So you can make it in the beginning.
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:32.560]   There's no reason why you can't make with nothing,
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.340]   starting with no salary, with nothing,
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.720]   if you understand the business,
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.160]   no reason why you can't make $100,000
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.560]   in your first year selling life insurance.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.040]   Now, that'll be 30,000 in the first six months
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.420]   and 70,000 in the second six months,
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.000]   but you can do $100,000
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.180]   in your first year selling life insurance.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:53.480]   It's really hard to do $100,000 of fees
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.240]   that are actually gonna be paid out to you
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.960]   across the grid with an RAA in the first year.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.200]   They may pay you a salary.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.060]   They may give you a $75,000 salary in the first year,
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.000]   but you can't get $100,000 across the grid
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.960]   in your first year with an RAA starting with no experience.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.440]   But you can do that in life insurance.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.840]   And the thing that's so awesome
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.640]   about a life insurance business is,
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.920]   and when I say life insurance,
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   I mean, again, life and health.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.760]   So life, disability, long-term care,
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.640]   maybe health insurance, although in this marketplace,
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.860]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.660]   But just life, disability, long-term care,
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.080]   the traditional life insurance,
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.600]   the products that life insurance companies sell.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.800]   You can build a broad base of clients.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.800]   And the sales process of selling life insurance
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.700]   is no different than the sales process
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.420]   of selling managed accounts.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:44.600]   But a lot more people will find it easier to say yes
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.340]   to life insurance than to say yes
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.820]   to moving a million dollars over to you.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:52.000]   Because it's just a simpler situation.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.760]   They're contracted with the insurance company,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.680]   not with you.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.520]   If you disappear, if you go up and pull up at night,
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.720]   they're gonna be annoyed if you do that.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.560]   And now they gotta figure out
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.900]   where they're gonna move their money.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.300]   But if you've got that in the beginning
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.540]   with life insurance,
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.280]   then it's not that big of a deal if you disappear,
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.440]   if you go out of the business.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.580]   And so you wanna build, so it works really well.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.120]   Now, the other thing that works really well
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.560]   being 33 years old is the life cycle.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.720]   So if you were to go out to most 33-year-old friends,
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.520]   and like it or not, most of your clients
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.220]   will match your age within a range.
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.800]   So most of your 33-year-old friends,
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:29.640]   if they're married, what do they need?
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.840]   They need life insurance, disability insurance.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.280]   Do they need investments?
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.160]   Yeah, but what should they be doing?
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.000]   Put money in their 401(k), put money in their Roth IRA.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.800]   Could you custodian their Roth IRA for them?
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.040]   Maybe, but it's really, it makes you no money.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.280]   It's not worth it,
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.400]   other than as just a relationship thing.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.680]   And so in the 33 years old,
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.840]   the life stage that many of your prospective clients are in
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.840]   is an insurance-heavy stage.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:59.060]   But what happens is as you build a broad client base,
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.600]   then those insurance clients
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.920]   naturally become investment clients.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.560]   So the insurance client who has
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.640]   four or five insurance policies with you
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.320]   naturally leaves one job and goes into another job.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.800]   And they're saying, "Hey, listen, man,
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.440]   "what should I do with my 401(k)?"
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.600]   And you explain, "Well, what should you do?"
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.640]   "Well, if you want, you could bring it over to me."
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.720]   And that's a natural thing in the life cycle
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.880]   where somebody brings over $200,000,
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.120]   somebody brings over $400,000, et cetera.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.680]   And so you can build the investment business
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.320]   and the life insurance business simultaneously.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.400]   And the thing that would frustrate me,
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:36.680]   I would not go into a fee-only model at this point in time.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.000]   That's big in the marketing speak.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.360]   Kitsis is a big fan of it,
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.400]   and he's like, "This has to be,
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.800]   "everyone's gotta be fee-only."
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.960]   I would not want to not sell life insurance
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.160]   and not earn commissions on life insurance.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.240]   Because I feel like with that as a tool,
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.560]   you can solve so many more people's problems.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.000]   And so if you're a competent financial planner,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.640]   if you're a good planner, and you understand tax,
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.000]   you understand estate, you understand insurance,
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.520]   you understand investments,
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.560]   then you can walk confidently into almost anybody's office
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.120]   knowing that 95% of the time,
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.600]   you'll be able to help them with something.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.800]   And most of the time, you'll be able to help them
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.000]   with something that also pays you.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.400]   And so it's really, really valuable.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.520]   So if you add to that the ability to do
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.600]   one-time financial plans or upfront financial plans
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.440]   for a package deal,
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.720]   if you add to that the ability to do hourly planning
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.560]   in some capacity as well,
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.840]   then you put this whole package together,
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.720]   in my opinion, that's a really compelling business model.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.840]   And when you go in that business model
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:35.200]   where you're willing to be the guy who's going out
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.800]   and prospecting for clients,
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.640]   you gain all the freedom in the world
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.200]   over your time, over your schedule,
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   over when you work, over when you don't work.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.440]   You gain massive levels of financial opportunity
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.080]   where it's not unreasonable for you
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.680]   to have a target of $300,000 five years in,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.080]   not in any way unreasonable for that to be your goal.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.880]   You could surpass it.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.160]   But if your targets are,
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.640]   hey, I'm gonna make 80,000 bucks my first year,
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.640]   300,000 bucks my fifth year, 750 by my 10th year,
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:11.600]   a million plus by my 15th,
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.040]   you try to, you strap those numbers into your life,
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.400]   your age, and all of a sudden now,
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.280]   the upfront work that's required,
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.640]   the massive infusion of effort that's required
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.600]   to build that kind of business is worth it now
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.000]   as compared to, yeah, I could go and get a salary
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.600]   working with a big retirement plan company for 100 grand,
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.160]   but this has a lot more opportunity
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.280]   and gives me total freedom of lifestyle.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.160]   So I love the business.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.520]   I think that it's a wonderful business.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.800]   I think that it's, I like it.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.320]   The only things I didn't like about it were,
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.920]   number one, I was stuck in one city, right?
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.360]   You gotta commit to a city.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.360]   You can't be bouncing all over the place.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.820]   You just kill yourself.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.260]   So you gotta like where you live
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.440]   and choose the market that you work in.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.520]   The other thing that I didn't like
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   was the repetitive nature of the conversations.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.120]   I got annoyed by having the same conversation
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.640]   and explaining, hey, here's how the term
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.920]   life insurance policy works again and again and again.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.520]   Here's how a whole life insurance policy works.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.160]   Here's why you need disability insurance.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.720]   And so for me, with my personality type,
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:19.720]   I craved new markets and new things to work in.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.880]   And you can do that, right?
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.560]   You can adjust your practice over time, and most people do.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.640]   But those were really the things that I didn't like.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.560]   And then the final thing that I struggled with
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.820]   in the beginning that I wouldn't struggle with now
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.520]   is I struggled with the fact that I was working
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:37.080]   with too many kind of just getting started people.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.000]   And it wasn't as exciting as working on big cases,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.160]   big estates, big portfolios.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.440]   And so that was primarily a function of my age
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.600]   and the fact that I didn't really know
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.880]   how to circulate in wealthy circles.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.840]   Today I would do better.
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.880]   But those were really the only things
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.200]   I didn't like about it.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.960]   I think it's a wonderful business.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.880]   - That's good, that really helps a lot.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.640]   One of the RIAs that I'm ongoing conversations with
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.640]   is they've introduced the same idea of
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.160]   be prepared to sell life insurance
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.560]   along with your financial planning work
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:15.700]   just as part of it and good supplemental income as well.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.000]   I didn't mention, but I've been a listener
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.920]   of yours for a while.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.640]   We do have a good cash cushion.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.920]   We have close to $200,000 in cash.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.560]   For the reason, if we needed a runway
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.000]   to be able to survive while building a business.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.920]   I just think that being so new to the industry
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.480]   that I would struggle doing my very own business
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.960]   from the start, which is why I've tried to partner
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:48.400]   with some of these other RIAs.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.520]   - Maybe you will struggle.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.680]   The majority of people do.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.880]   I don't know what any of the current statistics are,
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.160]   but when I used to be in the business,
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.320]   our numbers were that 80% of the people
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.600]   who started in the business
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.360]   wouldn't be there five years later.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.880]   A lot of people struggle.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.120]   A lot of people struggle.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:12.440]   So that struggle isn't necessarily a problem.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.080]   I have a very good friend of mine
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.000]   who I recruited to the business.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.360]   He was working in a sales job.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.560]   He was a recruiter for a college
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.120]   and I recruited him to the financial services business.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.240]   He came to my company.
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.680]   He started at my company.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.520]   He worked for a while.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.120]   He was very hardworking,
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.040]   but English was not his first language
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.240]   and he didn't have a wealthy natural market
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.200]   and he worked and worked and worked and failed
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.760]   and eventually he couldn't pass his securities exams.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:45.520]   He moved from my company to a wire house,
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.120]   worked there for six months, couldn't make it there.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.960]   Moved to, I think another,
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.360]   there was, I think, two companies in the interim.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:59.120]   The fourth company went to another insurance company,
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.720]   joined there as just a starting guy.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.200]   They saw his potential.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.280]   They coached him through
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.920]   and he was eventually able to pass his securities exams
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.160]   and then after he passed his securities exams,
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.880]   he wound up becoming a managing partner
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.440]   in that particular company
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.960]   and then he got recruited away to another company
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.080]   and now he is a managing director
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.560]   of his own office with this other company
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:26.040]   and it's an inspiring story
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.680]   because what I saw in that scenario
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.040]   was I saw a guy who had talent
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.800]   and a great personality, wonderful, very honest,
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.640]   very, just a great people guy, et cetera.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.800]   I helped recruit him but he failed at all the details
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.960]   but he didn't stop and he kept on going
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.840]   and at this point in time, he is in,
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.760]   he's what, 38 now, 37, 38 now, I think,
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.520]   something like that, and at this point in time,
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.800]   he is a managing director with a very large company,
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.880]   has tremendous support, has a tremendous income potential
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.960]   where within the next couple of years,
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.040]   he should be making seven figures every year
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:07.040]   for the rest of his life and he fought through it.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.360]   Now, I've also watched so many people come in
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.200]   and just simply not fight.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.080]   They don't, and they go out
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.240]   and sometimes they go out and they say,
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.160]   okay, this is just not for me
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.200]   and they wind up finding a situation
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.920]   where something else is.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.940]   A lot of people go into the business thinking,
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.160]   well, the core of this business
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.360]   is technically doing financial plans.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.280]   It's not, right, it's just not.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.320]   The financial planning that you do is very, very simple
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.680]   and so those people say,
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.200]   well, they wind up somewhere else, right?
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.320]   They wind up being an attorney
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.920]   and working in some advanced planning department
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.240]   or being a paraplanner supporting somebody, who is it?
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.200]   But if you've got the right expectations,
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.880]   it's a simple business
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.660]   and the thing I love about the business
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:47.520]   is that you don't have to maintain the products.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.920]   You can sell, you're selling insurance companies, right?
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.520]   Insurance policies at the beginning
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:55.400]   and so you'll be licensed with 15, 20,
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.720]   depending on 25 different insurance companies
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.680]   and so you've got all the insurance companies
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.960]   that are taking care of their business.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.900]   All you gotta do is take care of the clients
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.720]   and all of the companies that you'll go with,
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.200]   as long as they're not just a one-man shop,
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.120]   which I'm not saying you should ignore that, right?
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.000]   There are benefits of starting
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.760]   with a small, local, independent agency
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.120]   but they all have training, they all train you on it
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.940]   and so if you've got the cash cushion,
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.180]   the way I look at it is you would know a lot.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.400]   In any company that you join,
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.080]   you'll know a lot in six months
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.620]   and so at 33 years old,
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:30.140]   with a cash cushion to fall back on if you need it,
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.860]   I would go out and the first thing I would do
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.860]   is I would interview widely as you're doing.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:37.060]   Talk to an RIA, talk to an independent insurance agency,
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:39.060]   talk to a property and casualty company,
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.380]   go meet with the local, independent,
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.740]   Jones Brothers insurance agency,
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:48.460]   then go meet with the Allstate, the state farm,
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.620]   meet with them, talk to their recruiters.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:53.420]   Go and talk around the wire houses,
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:54.820]   meet with the wire houses,
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.940]   talk to the Edward Jones guy and find out,
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.820]   okay, if I built a practice with Edward Jones,
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.300]   what would that mean?
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.780]   What would it mean if I joined Merrill Lynch
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.860]   or what would it mean?
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.280]   Talk to the insurance companies, right?
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.380]   Talk to Northwestern Mutual, New York Life,
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.780]   talk to the local life insurance guy,
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.180]   talk to the guy who does this
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:15.700]   and if you go around, they're all wanting to recruit you.
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.060]   That's the benefit of the insurance business
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.100]   is that they're making their living on recruitment
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.640]   so they all wanna hear from you
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.220]   so go and interview with them
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:26.100]   and then find out what the opportunities are
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:29.060]   and then if one of them clicks with you,
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.780]   then try it for six months.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.660]   And in the financial business,
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:35.100]   trying something for six months won't,
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:39.240]   it's not such a black mark
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.500]   of being in the financial business.
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.980]   Rather, it actually gives you
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:45.860]   a tremendous amount of experience in the different options.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:50.300]   So I think at 33, money behind you so that you can make it,
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:51.980]   I think it's a wonderful thing for you to consider
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.740]   and could be very, very profitable.
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:58.240]   It's what I would do if I were in your shoes.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.780]   - That's really good stuff.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.600]   Thanks a lot, Joshua.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.520]   - My pleasure.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.100]   All right, we had several callers drop off
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.140]   so it looks like today we'll finish in Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:06.980]   Welcome to the show.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.900]   How can I serve you today?
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:10.000]   - Hey, Joshua, my name is Adam.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:10.840]   How are you?
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.660]   - I'm doing well, Adam.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.500]   Thank you for being here.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.580]   - Thank you.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:17.380]   So my question is about what I call
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:21.060]   kind of the middle of financial planning,
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:23.140]   meaning we're doing pretty well with,
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.020]   we've been aggressive with saving for retirement
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:25.980]   since the early age.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:29.540]   And then secondly, we kind of were aggressive
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:30.980]   with keeping our expenses low
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:34.020]   and putting away some cash such that we have
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.980]   what we're comfortable with, with emergency funds.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:41.180]   And then we both have jobs such that we can live off
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.820]   of one salary or the other.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.660]   Now looking up at age 40 and 41
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:49.560]   and seeing that it's possible that we could consider
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.380]   some sort of financial independence
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:53.420]   early retirement situation, maybe at,
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:58.660]   as early as 50, as late as 59 and a half.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.340]   So the two questions are,
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.300]   how do we approach health insurance
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.500]   if that were to be an option?
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:06.300]   And then the second question being,
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:10.060]   I sort of view each year of early retirement
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:13.500]   as a chunk of about $50,000 in today's dollars
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:16.020]   and trying to navigate whether the approach for that
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:21.020]   is funding a brokerage account with taxable income now
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.480]   or some sort of real estate or something like that.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.640]   Those are my kind of my two questions.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.200]   How do you fund each year of early retirement
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.280]   and sort of target that?
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.160]   And then how do you plan around health insurance?
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.120]   - How old are you?
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.780]   And what would be your target year for retirement?
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:40.640]   - We're 40 and 41 now.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.480]   Our youngest is 10 years old.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:45.080]   So in our minds, we sort of look at some point
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.460]   after he might be out of the college sphere.
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:52.460]   So it's probably the very earliest, 52, 53, maybe 55.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.400]   - And at the moment,
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.860]   your assets are primarily structured in mutual funds?
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.060]   - That's correct.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:02.140]   Yes, 401ks, Roth IRAs, some brokerage accounts, 529s,
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.940]   and then the rest would be in cash
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.380]   and some equity in the house.
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.380]   - Okay.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:10.420]   I answered this question on investment assets in detail
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.140]   on a recent Q&A show about two or three weeks back.
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:14.540]   So if you go back and look at the notes,
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:16.060]   you'll find that answer there
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.660]   when I had a similar caller who asked,
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:23.620]   how will I structure my income?
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.300]   And what you'll hear me say in that answer is it depends.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.140]   It's gonna depend on what you're doing
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.340]   and on what your interests are.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.280]   And I laid out for him several different scenarios.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.280]   And so what I would say is at the moment,
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:39.600]   you're too far away from retirement
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.180]   to be focused too much on that question.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:46.300]   There's a lot that could change in the next eight years.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.080]   So while you're not so far away,
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.180]   I would go back and listen to the question.
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:53.120]   I'm not running from the details,
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.480]   but the details are in that previous Q&A.
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.720]   And I go through it in very great detail.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.040]   But in short, it's gonna depend upon
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:05.180]   what your vision is of retirement.
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:08.380]   The short answer is you could just simply live
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:09.860]   on your portfolio.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.740]   What I think is the most likely answer for most people
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.420]   is you would generate some income
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:16.840]   from some of your activities,
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.820]   sideline consulting income,
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.860]   little bit of part-time work or something like that.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.540]   And then also you have to be clear on your lifestyle
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:27.780]   before you figure out what kind of investments
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.300]   are appropriate for you.
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.140]   So go and listen to that Q&A.
[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:33.500]   And then if you have additional questions,
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.740]   call in next week and we'll cover it in detail
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.140]   for your situation.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:39.140]   But I think that it's important for you
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:39.980]   to be thinking about,
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.860]   but I think that I wonder if,
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:44.460]   since you're already focusing heavily on mutual funds,
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:48.140]   then it's probably a little early for you to figure out,
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.980]   well, how do I deploy these mutual funds?
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.880]   Let's talk about health insurance though.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.140]   I think that, first of all,
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.160]   you're a US citizen living in the United States
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.060]   and planning to live in the United States, is that right?
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:58.900]   - That is correct.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:03.820]   - Okay, so I think that it's more likely than not
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.820]   that eight years from now,
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:08.900]   there will be some kind of socialized
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:13.140]   single-payer health program available in the United States.
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:16.100]   And that that is probably what you will roll into.
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.740]   I can't predict that,
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:21.540]   but I can't be sure of that, obviously,
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.900]   but I think that's probably the most likely outcome.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.820]   There is substantial, I don't see at this point in time,
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:34.780]   when the Republican Congress was elected in 2016,
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.340]   there was a Republican Congress
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.660]   and the Republican Congress was elected
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:41.820]   with the mandate from voters
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:44.740]   to repeal the Affordable Care Act,
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:50.260]   to overturn the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:53.820]   And when John McCain famously gave his thumbs down
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.200]   on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.060]   as far as I can tell, that was probably the death knell
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.880]   on any major return to a private party health insurance
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.320]   system in the United States.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.840]   Now, the Affordable Care Act has been in many ways,
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.580]   a nightmare for many people.
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:17.080]   Years ago, I thought that people would say,
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.800]   I had people say, man, this thing is not gonna work.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.880]   This must just be designed to fail
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.360]   so that we can usher in,
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.760]   pass the Affordable Care Act,
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:29.360]   then it'll usher in a path to single-payer healthcare.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.520]   And at the time I thought, that's crazy,
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.800]   that's a crazy conspiracy theory.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.120]   Right now, I'm not so sure.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:38.360]   I'm not so sure it was a crazy conspiracy theory
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.480]   because that certainly seems to be what's happening,
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.680]   is that we had the Affordable Care Act
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.720]   and then here we are however many years later,
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.400]   and now, former Vice President Joe Biden,
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.360]   the Democratic presidential candidate is running
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.440]   based upon, well, look, we're gonna have
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.760]   the Biden healthcare plan.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.760]   I thought we already had that.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.440]   I thought we had the Obama-Biden healthcare plan,
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.200]   but evidently things have changed.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.080]   And so at this point in time,
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.440]   I don't see or sense any significant will
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.160]   on behalf of Republican voters
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.240]   to repeal the Affordable Care Act,
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.720]   but there is a very strong press
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.880]   towards more and more government intervention in healthcare.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.440]   And right now, I don't know if anyone
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.000]   is happy with the system.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]   And so when you have an awful system
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.720]   where no one is happy,
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.760]   that means that some change is going to happen.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.120]   And I think that change is going to be in the direction
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.400]   of more and more government-run healthcare.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.520]   The models have been worked out in other countries.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.200]   That's the constant thing you hear is that,
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.360]   well, look, Canada has this
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.720]   and the United Kingdom has this, et cetera.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.920]   And so it's not like it's unheard of.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.240]   The United States is a little bit behind
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.280]   some of those countries in terms of social trends,
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.880]   but not very far behind.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:52.640]   And I don't think there's any philosophical argument
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.720]   against that kind of government-paid healthcare
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:00.280]   that is, I don't hear anybody making it.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.200]   The principled argument would be
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.640]   government shouldn't be involved in health insurance,
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.120]   but nobody's making that.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.080]   If they did make it,
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.080]   they would have to argue against Medicare.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.040]   But since Medicare has been in place for many decades
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.440]   and no politician will touch Medicare,
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.320]   at this point in time,
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.680]   I think it's very likely that within eight years
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.280]   that there would be a form of government health insurance
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.440]   available to you.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.680]   So if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't worry about it.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.520]   I would just watch it
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.720]   and I would say that that's probably what's gonna happen.
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.200]   And then again, there are other options.
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.360]   If you were two years away,
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.720]   I would give you a bunch of other options
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.760]   of things that could be discussed.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:37.040]   But since you're eight years away,
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.080]   I think that by then you can just simply enroll,
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:40.000]   you'll be able to simply enroll
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.600]   in some kind of government option
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:44.040]   and that will cover your health insurance needs
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.240]   without regard to your employment status.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.640]   - Okay, that makes sense.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.960]   I appreciate that.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:52.160]   - Cool, my pleasure.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.200]   All right, anything else?
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.960]   I got one more caller, but listen to that Q&A.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.120]   And then if you don't understand something
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.240]   about that, call in next week
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.040]   and we'll discuss more details of that.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.760]   - Sounds good, take care.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:01.720]   - Very good.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.080]   All right, Mark in California.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.920]   Mark, you made it back just in time.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.800]   I was about to finish up, but you snuck in.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.200]   So welcome to the show, sir.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.360]   - Thank you, Josh.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.160]   Thank you for taking my call.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.280]   I have a credit card question for you.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.800]   My wife and I, this year,
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:22.120]   we both applied for the same credit card
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:24.120]   and we were both denied.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.200]   And our letters were pretty similar
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:29.880]   in that they said, essentially,
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:32.400]   I think we have too many bank cards
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.400]   or we also have, maybe they're underutilized,
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:40.640]   like they're not being used enough.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.960]   So they're wondering why we need more credit.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.600]   And so we're just wondering what's the best approach
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.760]   to deal with, I guess, being able to be approved
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:53.600]   in the future.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.080]   - Good question.
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:55.920]   Okay, so the first--
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.200]   - Our credit scores are pretty good.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.040]   - Okay.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.080]   - Like 800.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.320]   - The first thing that you need to do
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.040]   is search that specific credit card
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.400]   that you got denied for
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.480]   and search in the credit card forums online
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.840]   and find out if other people are being denied
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:12.800]   for similar reasons.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.680]   Now, depending on the card and depending on the issuer,
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:18.680]   there may be some clear and obvious reasons
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.880]   or there may not be, right?
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.200]   A number of years ago,
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.240]   people were getting declined all over the place
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.160]   for Chase cards.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.560]   And then finally, Chase confirmed
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560]   that they had their 5/24 rule,
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:32.200]   which is just a flat rule that they were applying
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:35.680]   that said, hey, if you've opened five or more credit cards
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:38.040]   within the past 24 months, we're not giving you a card.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.360]   And so it wasn't, and this made a big deal
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.440]   in the credit card space
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.680]   because many people would routinely open five or more
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.520]   in the last 24 months.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.400]   Well, Chase decided they were gonna cap that.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.120]   And so first thing is search that specific card
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:55.120]   and see if there is an actual,
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:01.240]   see if there's something specific to that card
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.440]   or to that company that may relate to your case.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.200]   The second thing is definitely utilization is important.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.040]   And if you don't have proper utilization,
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.720]   then it's gonna matter.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.120]   And so one of the things that is very important
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.240]   is you should have on all of your cards,
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.920]   you should have something going to that card
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.740]   every month if possible.
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:26.360]   Now this can be difficult and you can't always do this,
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.980]   but you could of course use the cards at a personal,
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:34.000]   use the cards at a personal expense,
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]   swipe it for gas or groceries or whatever you've got
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.500]   and use all the cards.
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.600]   But if you have cards that you're not using regularly,
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:43.280]   you should have some kind of bill payment billed to that.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.460]   Over the last couple of years,
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:46.240]   I've lost several credit cards
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.360]   because I didn't do that properly.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.640]   And because I didn't use it, I didn't use the card,
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.840]   it was just sitting there as part of my portfolio.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.280]   The company sent me notices,
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:57.480]   I didn't get those notices because I was traveling
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.400]   and I didn't bother to check the mail.
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:02.360]   And so I go back and all of a sudden I try to use a card
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.460]   and find out, hey, this card is not active anymore.
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.640]   And I had I think three cards canceled
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:07.960]   over the last year and a half
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.420]   because I didn't have them all set up.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.800]   So going forward, my new plan is that
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.920]   every one of my credit cards needs some monthly payment,
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.280]   some monthly expense charged to it.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.280]   So I take any kind of personal expense,
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:28.120]   a bill of some kind that's gonna be automatically billed
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.960]   and bill it to each of my cards.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.160]   And then I still have the automatic payment system set up
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:37.600]   so that there is going to be properly a,
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.320]   so that it's gonna get paid off.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.620]   So that'll show some activity being reported
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:44.000]   on every card every month.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.680]   And then if your letter led you to indicate
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.080]   that they wanna see you using more of your credit,
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.920]   then I think you need to use more of your credit
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.600]   and use it across the cards.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:57.600]   So if your normal monthly spend is $3,000 a month,
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.980]   then don't just always do that on one card.
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:01.800]   You obviously need to balance the card
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.840]   that you're putting your spending on for a bonus
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:06.020]   and a signup bonus or whatever you're doing,
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:07.760]   but you should move that spend around
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:11.480]   so that your credit card portfolio looks more active.
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.840]   And then if they, there's benefits
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.380]   to holding a balance from time to time.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:17.360]   So if you're gonna buy something big ticket,
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:20.360]   then put it on a 0% card so that your credit profile
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.840]   shows that you're holding a balance from time to time
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:27.020]   with a 0% card so you're not incurring
[01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:28.100]   a bunch of interest charges.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:30.840]   But you gotta remember, the credit card company
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:33.560]   doesn't make any money if you don't hold any balances,
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:36.400]   if you don't use your cards and they just sit there.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.560]   So your 800 credit score isn't gonna say to them
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.760]   that this is a good customer for them
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.960]   if you don't hold any money.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.480]   They're in the business of lending money,
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.920]   so they wanna see you borrowing money.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.080]   So if that's what your letter indicates,
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:49.640]   then change the way that your credit profile looks
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:51.600]   so that it looks like you're an active user
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:54.200]   of the credit cards and an active borrower of money.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:59.040]   - Okay, thank you, appreciate that.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.120]   - Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:03.880]   And it's definitely something where you'll learn.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:05.760]   Here's the thing, the credit card business
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:07.000]   is always changing.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.000]   And so if you find that, hey, what I was doing before
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.320]   isn't working anymore, then you have to change
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.920]   what you're doing, and we're all in that space.
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:19.600]   So don't be scared to just simply admit it and move on.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.040]   All right, Marcus, you snuck in.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:22.560]   I had already said it was gonna be the last call,
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.760]   but you snuck in, so let's go fast.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.320]   What's your question, sir?
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.960]   Oh, Marcus disappeared right when I was needed.
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.760]   And with that, that brings us to the end of the show.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.480]   Thank you very much for being here.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.960]   A couple of closing comments as we go.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.640]   First of all, I hope you enjoy these Q&A shows.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:39.360]   I always love recording them for you.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.960]   And if you'd like to join me next week,
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.880]   go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.400]   Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.120]   or just search radical personal finance at Patreon,
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.600]   and you'll gain access to next week's call.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.880]   I mentioned this earlier, so I'll just quickly plug it
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.480]   that this last week, we went ahead and got set back up
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.920]   for more of a consulting business.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.480]   So I'm able to offer to you individual consulting before.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.840]   I haven't done any consulting work for the last six months,
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:07.320]   but here in the fourth quarter, I will be doing it.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.080]   I'm not sure how long I'm gonna do it.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:10.800]   I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it in the 2021,
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.300]   but here in Q4, for the remainder of the year,
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.340]   you can go ahead and book it.
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.440]   So if you would like to book a consultation with me,
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.740]   no need to email me now,
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:21.020]   which was previously the old system.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:24.440]   Now, just go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.920]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.080]   and you can book a consulting call with me.
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:33.600]   I didn't put a disclaimer on there,
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:36.240]   but I actually need to go and update those notes.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.840]   I have never had, I've had one call
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.360]   in all of the consulting calls that I've ever done
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.240]   where I told the guy, "Don't send me any money,"
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.800]   and where the guy didn't wanna send me any money
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.360]   'cause we got into a conflict.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.000]   Other than that, I have consulted with a lot of people,
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.040]   and I've never had somebody who said
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.400]   that they didn't get all the use of their money
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.560]   and from that call, and I stand behind what I do.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.920]   I have had tremendous outcomes
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:04.800]   from individual consulting calls with many, many people.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.760]   And so what I would recommend to you
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.740]   is if you have ever thought about talking
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.160]   to a financial advisor,
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.280]   I can't think of a better way that you can do it.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.720]   You can talk, of course, here on a Friday Q&A show.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:16.780]   That's obviously an option,
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:18.640]   but if you'd like to talk about something private,
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.340]   then I don't know of any solution
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:23.640]   that would be better for you than to book a consulting call.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.220]   I don't sell anything.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.760]   I don't have any products for sale.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:29.120]   I don't have any, I don't sell insurance.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.280]   I don't sell investments.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.920]   I don't sell anything except my advice.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:36.080]   And it's hard, trust me,
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.680]   it was hard to create that independence,
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.200]   but a lot of people do want that independence,
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.360]   and I think rightly so.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.360]   So if you wanna use me as a second opinion, that's great.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.920]   And then I would say this is that
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.080]   it's probably not the thing
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.600]   that's most commonly advertised
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.400]   when you talk about consulting work and whatnot,
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.520]   but it does matter,
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.520]   is that I don't know of a more private financial advisor
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.000]   than me.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.640]   We've talked a lot about financial privacy,
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:03.460]   and I've talked about how
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.600]   when you talk to financial advisors,
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.160]   you're giving up access to your information.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.840]   For the vast majority of situations, that's fine.
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.040]   But if you'd like to talk to probably
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.680]   the world's most private financial advisor, I'm your guy.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:16.420]   You can register with any name that you want.
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:18.680]   You can pay with any payment method that you want.
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:20.080]   I don't care.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.900]   I don't need to see anything
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:24.180]   about what your legally given name is,
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:25.520]   and I don't care at all.
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.340]   That's number one.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:27.680]   Number two is I don't keep any notes.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.160]   I write on a light yellow legal pad.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.040]   I show up to a meeting with a financial calculate
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.200]   and a yellow legal pad.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.520]   At the end of the day, my legal pages go into a shredder,
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.200]   and I don't keep any client notes.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.580]   I don't keep any client files.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:40.580]   It's just simply that.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.720]   So if you'd like to talk to a financial advisor
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.160]   and get a second opinion about something that you're doing
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:46.200]   or thinking about doing
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:48.360]   or talk about something that you're doing,
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.200]   there's no limit to the things that we've talked about.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.480]   I talk about offshore planning.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.160]   I talk about business creation.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.000]   I talk about marketing.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.400]   I talk about all the technical aspects
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:56.220]   of financial planning.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.520]   You can do that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.960]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:04.480]   if you would like to book a consulting call with me.
