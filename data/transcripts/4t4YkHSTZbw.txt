[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   Nat and I have goals when I play poker.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.680]   She always leaves me with the following.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.600]   Play well, check.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.760]   Have fun, check.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.780]   Do not eat late at night, never a check.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.840]   - Not a chance. - Never a check.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.720]   - As soon as we finish dinner within 20 minutes,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.140]   back at the poker table, Timoth's like,
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.120]   "May I have my Haagen-Dazs now?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.120]   May I have my second Haagen-Dazs now?
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.260]   Helmuth, you are buying the melt tonight.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.080]   Helmuth, fire up the cheeseburger melt."
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.600]   Did you see, Friedberg, you should have seen last week,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.400]   Helmuth at the dinner table,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.280]   Sean made some like incredible, I thought,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.480]   like fresh sorbet of some fruit or whatever.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.240]   He at the dinner table, ordered from DoorDash,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.360]   double stuffed Oreos, some Nutter Butters,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.640]   and some cherry beets. - Nutter Butters.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760]   - They arrived when we left dinner
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.640]   and got back to the poker room.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.880]   It was so disgusting.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.120]   And then the next day, my whole household, everybody,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.240]   Nat, the kids, they're like, "What are these things?"
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.760]   They were like holding up these Nutter Butters.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.600]   They were looking at them like,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.320]   "I've never seen a Nutter Butter."
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.720]   The best part about Phil Helmuth's DoorDash addiction
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.640]   is that like at least once a month,
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   Timoth will be like, "Somebody ordered like four entrees,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360]   like pastas and two desserts to my house
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.440]   and I didn't order it."
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.600]   And Phil's like, "Oh, that's me on the group chat.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000]   That's me."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.560]   'Cause he doesn't take the time
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.200]   to change his address back to his house.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.840]   And then you see the naked truth of what he's ordering.

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.200]   Breaking News Thursdays continues here
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160]   at the All In Podcast, episode 172.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.600]   But SBF was just sentenced with me again today on the pod.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.640]   Of course, the dictator chairman Chamath Palihapitiya,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.840]   sultan of science, David Freeberg,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.680]   and the Rain Man, yeah, David Sachs.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.320]   I'm Jason Kalankanis.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.800]   Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.880]   episode 172 of the All In Podcast, your favorite.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.480]   SBF, just sentenced 25 years.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.280]   - You're always over-hyping.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.120]   - Always, a hype man, it's always what I do.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.960]   - Over-deliver.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.520]   - Absolutely, I'm a hype man.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.280]   I'm like Flavor Flay of this organization.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.280]   SBF, Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX was found guilty,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.240]   as you know, a couple of months ago in November,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.160]   and he just got sentenced to 25 years.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.640]   In total, FTX customers lost $8 billion,
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.400]   investors lost $1.7 billion,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.880]   and lenders lost $1.3 billion.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   - Is that without parole?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   When is he eligible for parole, is that?
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.040]   - That is a good question.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.880]   Doesn't say what the parole could be.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.720]   The prosecutor said--
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.000]   - There's no possibility of parole in federal criminal cases.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.160]   - Yeah, so federal prosecutors thought 40 to 50 years,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.640]   so the judge went a little bit light, I guess,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.840]   and gave half.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.000]   In his sentencing, Judge Louis Kaplan said,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.880]   "SBF had lied throughout the trial and showed no remorse."
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.000]   Quote, "He knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.520]   "He regrets that he made a very bad bet
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.320]   "about the likelihood of getting caught,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.400]   "but he is not going to admit a thing, as is his right."
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.440]   In related news, FTX is also selling
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   the majority of its stake in Anthropic
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.160]   for $884 million to Mubadala,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.760]   one of the sovereign wealth funds from the UAE,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.960]   and other investors, including Jane Street,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.720]   where SBF worked for a hot minute,
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   the Ford Foundation, Fidelity, and some other investors.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.280]   From CNBC, lawyers representing the bankruptcy estate
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.000]   told the judge in Delaware last month
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.640]   that they expect to fully repay customers
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.000]   and creditors with legitimate claims in the FTX case.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.520]   That doesn't take into account equity holders,
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.440]   so it looks like that one investment
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.920]   could save a lot of people their deposits.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.360]   - I saw an analysis recently that showed
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.480]   that they were gonna be in a surplus,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.080]   so investors were gonna get money back
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.920]   and all the depositors were gonna get
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.560]   their full 100% back.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.960]   - Yeah, I don't know how much Bitcoin
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.440]   or other coins they owned,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.040]   but if they didn't sell that Bitcoin at 30 or 40
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.480]   and it's at 60 or 70 now,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.400]   yeah, that would be material, right?
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.840]   - The crazy thing is that SBF was not,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.440]   it turns out, a terrible investor.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.320]   He made a seed investment in Anthropic
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.000]   that's worth billions now.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.480]   He made a seed investment in Solana
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   that I think is worth billions now,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.760]   especially now that Solana's recovered.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.440]   I think that Solana was hard with the brush
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.000]   of being a SAM coin because SBF invested in it,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.160]   but as it turns out, as far as we know,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.000]   it's a completely legitimate developer project.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.640]   SAM was an investor, but not a participant.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.680]   And you look at the price of it,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.680]   it's now rallied to something
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.840]   like an $80 billion market cap.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.120]   The point being that a lot of the investments he made
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.160]   ended up being pretty good investments.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.360]   And FTX itself, the trading platform,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   as far as we know, was a functional, workable business.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.800]   I mean, it was a offshore crypto marketplace,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.680]   so I don't want to necessarily use the word legitimate,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.600]   but I think that it was, I think,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.160]   as good as any of these trading platforms.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.600]   So the crazy part of this is,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.960]   I'd say unlike the Madoff case,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.080]   where from the beginning with Madoff,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.680]   it was entirely a Ponzi scheme.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.520]   There was nothing of value there.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.120]   In this case, you had a, call it legitimate
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.440]   or semi-legitimate crypto platform
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   combined with some legitimate angel investments.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.000]   And so what I think went wrong here was Alameda,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.120]   that Sam decided to siphon off customer deposits
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.640]   to gamble with his hedge fund,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.800]   which was completely optional.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.760]   He didn't need to do that.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.800]   I mean, he already had a winning business
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.000]   and winning bets in his portfolio.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.240]   So this whole Alameda thing, he didn't need to get into.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.800]   And then of course, siphoning off customer deposits
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.520]   to spray around for political donations
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.600]   to feel like you're a big shot was also really stupid.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.840]   So this is the crazy thing I think about SBF
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.680]   is it was sort of like this manic,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   there was like a manic element to it.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.360]   There was a messianic element to it.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.400]   He wanted to take shortcuts.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.320]   He wanted to believe he was gonna save the world
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.920]   and then did all these criminal things in pursuit of that,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.000]   that he didn't really need to in order to be successful.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.880]   And that's why I think it's such a curious case
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.600]   is it's not, it wasn't full Madoff in a way
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.160]   because there were some legitimate elements to his portfolio.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.440]   - You're right about the messianic thing.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.400]   These guys were all drunk on this effective altruism concept
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.760]   that I think whatever crimes they committed
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.320]   by stealing the deposits and then going and investing them,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.640]   they saw themselves as Robin Hood.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.160]   We're gonna take these deposits,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.120]   we're gonna make a ton of money
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.360]   and then we're gonna give it all away.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.920]   Of course, they didn't have a CFO.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.800]   Nobody did diligence on these investments.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.560]   There were no controls in place.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.400]   And he was literally stealing his customers money to gamble.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.120]   - And I think actually one quote that I saw reported
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   from the judge was that if you steal customer's money,
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.680]   go to Vegas, gamble it, you're still guilty
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.760]   even if you can pay them back with the winnings.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.400]   But that suggests to me that actually the FTX trustee
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.120]   is on a path to repaying the 11 billion
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.960]   of customer deposits that were absconded with.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.800]   - I just found it.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.640]   - I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.480]   - It is true.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.280]   In early February, the trustee said
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.520]   they now expect 100% payment back to the depositors
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.680]   and all the accounts and all the excess
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.400]   will go to the shareholders in FTX,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.920]   all the preferred holders that invested in the stock.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.440]   I don't know what the total press stack was in FTX,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.720]   but it sounds like there's gonna be recovery there as well
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.800]   after all of the customer deposits are made whole.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.640]   - Wow.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.880]   - So this is my point is he didn't need to do this.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.360]   I mean, it was so insane.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   I mean, FTX, like I said, was a workable business.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.520]   He made workable seed bets,
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.360]   but then he went crazy with Alameda
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.440]   and the Robinhood stuff.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.200]   So it's just such an interesting case.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.280]   - By the way, Sax, Alameda is what he started with.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.480]   So he started a firm
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.320]   that was meant to arbitrage crypto markets
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.680]   because there's all these different markets
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.700]   that didn't connect around the world.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.400]   So the original concept was that he would set up a hedge fund
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.800]   like a Jane Street to arbitrage.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.920]   And so he would arbitrage crypto pairs
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.680]   using different exchanges around the world.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.880]   He set up all these different accounts
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.480]   and he would trade long one way, short the other way
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.160]   and make a spread.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   And then he made so much money on the hedge fund
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.200]   and he said, "Why don't we just do this all centrally?"
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.960]   And that's how he started setting up FTX
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.240]   was his own cryptocurrency exchange.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   So like the legacy was that Alameda
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.760]   was there from the beginning
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.920]   and the arbitrage across these illiquid,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.000]   no transparency type markets
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.560]   was really the core driving principle
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.000]   when he started all this work.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.800]   The crypto exchange came later.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.640]   And so it was like he always had this orientation
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.680]   that he was trying to arb everything.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.520]   And I think I told you guys this
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.880]   when I saw that video on YouTube
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.320]   right after he got arrested
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.400]   and then they took it down off of YouTube.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.720]   It was like an hour long video showing him trading
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.240]   and doing his day job in the office.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.680]   It reminded me of like a mouse in a maze,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.480]   like chronic, like everything was like arb,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.160]   like he was finding little arbs he could make everywhere,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.000]   nonstop.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.840]   - But they weren't great at it.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.960]   They lost a ton of money.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.640]   And then he puts this dingbat in charge of Alameda
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.280]   who proceeds to lose billions of dollars.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.440]   I mean, the whole thing was so stupid.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   - I mean, it's gonna be such a great movie.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.320]   I can't wait for the movie.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.800]   - I think one of the craziest parts of this
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.560]   is he had co-founders in FTX
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.320]   who weren't part of Alameda
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.920]   and they just let him do this.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.800]   Why would they do that?
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.120]   I mean, their own stakes in FTX minus Alameda
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   could have been worth many millions of dollars,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.720]   hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions of dollars.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.440]   - And the truth is in business,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.880]   you can do all kinds of criminal and crazy things
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.200]   until you get caught.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.600]   And these folks were doing insane, crazy things
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   that the system is based on trust
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.040]   and people can break that trust.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.720]   We saw it, remember with what was a Fulltail Poker,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.360]   they were also taking the customer accounts
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.760]   and gambling those dollars.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.840]   They literally mixed the operations budget
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.480]   and the customer deposits at Fulltail Poker.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.600]   - I think part of the rationale, if I remember right,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.840]   I read the Michael Lewis book on this
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.400]   and part of the rationale SBF gave to Michael Lewis
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.800]   was that Alameda was supposed to be a market maker,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.240]   liquidity provider to the exchange.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.040]   So they were playing an active role on the exchange
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.200]   of making trades available to create the market.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.400]   And that was a key aspect of getting the market moving
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   was that they had this well-capitalized market maker
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.440]   and they knew how to actively trade on a platform
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.760]   and they just built their own platform
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.040]   and then they were able to attract with more liquidity,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.360]   more participants onto their exchange.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.240]   And that was a key aspect of the business model.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.840]   - Yeah, but that could have kickstarted it,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.200]   but like five minutes into it,
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.560]   you could probably turn that off.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.120]   I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.840]   Like they didn't need to do that
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.480]   once you get to a certain point.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.800]   - Also, these people were all on speed.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   So there's that.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.480]   - It contributed to the mania.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   - Yeah, I think like they were hopped up on speed
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.120]   and they felt that they were gods
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.240]   and that stocks go up, coins go up.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.440]   They can do anything they want.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.320]   They can hang out with celebrities.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.200]   They just got diluted and they were super entitled.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.600]   I mean, this is a level of entitlement
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.800]   and criminal behavior that we rarely see.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.680]   Doesn't matter if their tokens went up.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.480]   - When I had my one and only interaction with SPF,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.880]   which was over a Zoom, I asked for a model
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.560]   and this arrogant ding-dong that worked for him
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.160]   sent me like a five line Excel spreadsheet.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.560]   And I thought, this is the worst example
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.240]   of arrogance and hubris I've ever seen.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.720]   - I had one interaction with SPF.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.560]   - Uh-oh.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.480]   - Do you want to hear it?
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.360]   - I got a little bit of a tiff with him.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.040]   So it was at a tech conference.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.400]   This was a few years ago.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.240]   This is when he was absolutely at his peak.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.680]   Everybody wanted to talk to him.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.960]   He was sort of holding court.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.480]   He had a bunch of lackeys around him.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.600]   And this is like a pretty exclusive tech conference.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.240]   I'm not gonna tar their name
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.760]   by mentioning them in this context.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.600]   But so a friend of mine said,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.000]   "You want to go over and meet with SPF?"
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360]   And so I said, "Sure, whatever."
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.160]   So we go sit down and I started asking him
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.600]   about this ballot initiative
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.960]   that he was funding in California
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.400]   to raise our taxes to fund a pandemic prevention center.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.000]   And it later turned out
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.280]   that his brother was gonna run this thing.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.200]   And so I said to him, "You don't even live in California.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.120]   "What are you doing funding a ballot initiative
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.640]   "here in my state where I live?
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.280]   "You live in the Bahamas or whatever,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.400]   "in order to fund this boondoggle,
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.520]   "which by the way is looking in the rear view mirror.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   "We don't need it.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.000]   "Like COVID's over.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.160]   "And even if we did need a pandemic prevention center,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.120]   "the federal government should do it,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.880]   "not California taxpayers."
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.960]   And he starts getting very animated defense this thing.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.880]   We end up, we sort of get into an argument.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.520]   And so I kind of ended it by saying,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.320]   "Well, listen, I'm gonna, just to let you know,
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.760]   "like I'm gonna publicly oppose this vigorously."
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.800]   And 'cause I just wanted to let him know,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.120]   like I'm gonna call you out for this.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.280]   - Standing up for the little guy, David Sachs.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.520]   David Sachs, come in here.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.720]   Standing up for his state.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.760]   - So when I got back from that conference,
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.400]   I actually talked about it on this pod.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.160]   I talked about that ballot initiative in California.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.080]   - Yeah, I remember.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.920]   - And that was the, that was the origin story of that.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.760]   - They capitulated, right?
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.600]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.680]   Yeah, like a month later,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.280]   they dropped that thing 'cause it was too much heat.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.480]   But little did we know
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.680]   that they were enmeshed in all this criminality
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.880]   and they were absconding with all this money.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.360]   - What is Sam Bankman-Freed's brother's name?
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.120]   Bam Bankman-Freed?
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.680]   - Was it like Gabe or something?
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.560]   - Oh, Gabe, nice.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.320]   - I had one interaction with him at some,
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.160]   at a annual general meeting,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.840]   I got asked to interview him.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.480]   And it was like a private affair,
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.680]   a couple of months before this all blew up.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.480]   And he's dressed like a slob.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.880]   You know, like literally doesn't look like he showered.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.800]   Clothes don't fit.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.920]   He's wearing flip-flops and shorts.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.600]   He's kind of like the shtick.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.720]   And he's a billionaire, blah, blah, blah.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   And I start talking to him and his leg is shaking.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.640]   Like-
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.880]   - Breastless leg syndrome.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.240]   - I mean, but no, it's,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.400]   he's got his hand on it and he's trying to control it.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.000]   - Did he have restless leg syndrome?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.080]   - It's bouncing.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.240]   I kid you not, like a hundred times a minute.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.320]   It was disturbing.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.040]   And so I'm wondering if this guy's got a panic attack
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.520]   or what's going on.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.440]   And I kind of like toned down my crypto skepticism questions
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.920]   because I felt so bad for him
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   that I thought he was having a panic attack.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.240]   And then I realized this guy's hopped up on (beep) speed.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.120]   And he's got so much of Adderall or whatever.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.040]   These kids were taking some patches
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.160]   that you wear to release this stuff.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.960]   I am convinced that these guys were taking a level of speed.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.560]   - Unbelievable.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.040]   - That would kill an elephant.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.800]   - Like Vietnam War level.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.840]   - Yeah, like these guys were out there.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.080]   I mean, he was, I mean, patches.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.360]   These guys were wearing patches and he was shaking them.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.480]   - Was it like this?
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.640]   - No.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.480]   - Oh.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.160]   - Did Hitler have that?
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.000]   - He was apparently a totally addicted to drugs.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.960]   - Oh right, Hitler was also on speed.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.080]   That looks like he's on amphetamines there.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.560]   It did look like that actually.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.840]   If I'm being honest,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.040]   it was kind of almost exactly like that.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.320]   Oh my God, where is that?
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.760]   For people who don't know,
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.120]   the Third Reich was on speed.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.440]   There's like many, many stories about this.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.480]   Yes, Sax?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.720]   That they were hopped up on speed?
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.560]   - I believe so.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.280]   I'm not sure, but I believe so.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.640]   I think entire books have been written
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.400]   about drug use by the Third Reich,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.320]   but I haven't delved into it.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.920]   - Yeah, no, no.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.160]   I've listened to a couple of podcasts about it, in fact.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.840]   And so it must be true.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.760]   I've listened to some podcasts.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.040]   All right, moving on in the-
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.640]   - If it was on MSNBC, it must be true.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.320]   - Or Fox, or Fox.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   Or if it was Beep the Great,
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.240]   your anonymous friend on Twitter, it must be true.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.280]   All right, Trump just made $5 billion
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.040]   on paper with his memes back.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.640]   Trump's social network has finally de-SPAC'd.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.720]   It's now publicly traded.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.760]   You can go buy Donald Trump's SPAC at DJT,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.000]   is the ticker symbol.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.040]   They are on pace for a whopping $4.5 million in revenue
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.680]   on a $60 million loss.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.200]   They're growing like 3x year over year.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.080]   And the company is not disclosing any user metrics.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.320]   This quote from one of their recent filings is next.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.480]   "At this juncture in its development, TMTG,"
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.680]   the Trump Media and Technology Group,
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.920]   "believes that adhering to traditional KPIs,
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.520]   "such as signups, average revenue per user,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.800]   "ad impressions, and pricing, or active user accounts,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.560]   "including monthly and daily active users,
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.760]   "could potentially divert its focus
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.200]   "from strategic evaluation with respect
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.560]   "to the progress and growth of its business."
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.080]   So they're not tracking people-
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.480]   - Isn't that the business?
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.720]   - It's so laughable, I can barely get through it.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.200]   - That's crazy, they said that?
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.120]   - Literally, they said it.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.600]   It's a quote from their SEC filing.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.440]   - Wow.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.280]   - "According to similar web estimates,
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.600]   "Truth Social had about 5 million visits last month.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.160]   "As of Thursday morning, it's worth about $8.5 billion."
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.520]   Same as Reddit, or close to 2,000 times top-line revenue.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.840]   Company had about $300 million in cash after the merger.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.360]   By comparison, Reddit has $800 million in revenue.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   Their market cap's $8.4 billion,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.800]   or about 10 times revenue.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.200]   So it should be about five, six, seven times revenue
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   would be more realistic according to basic media comps.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   Reddit had 2 billion visits last month,
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.720]   with 73 million daily active users.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.640]   That's pretty significant.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.560]   The SPAC took a long time to close.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   There was an SEC investigation
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.880]   into three men allegedly making 23 million,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   buying, then dumping shares of DWAC
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.640]   after the merger was announced.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.000]   They all faced at least five fraud and conspiracy charges.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.440]   Of course, this is what happened before it was de-SPAC.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.120]   And so, what do you think, Chama?
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.840]   Thoughts on this meme SPAC, or SPAC?
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.280]   - I just think we should be really clear,
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.000]   because you're just floating
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.440]   this insider trading thing out there
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.480]   as part of the introduction, which is a huge allegation.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   And we have to be really clear,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.040]   that is related to a few investors
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.600]   and not to the company itself.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.080]   And the company SPAC was approved by the SEC.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.920]   So I just think we have to be clear about that.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.240]   - Here's the SEC chart.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.360]   Yeah, just to be super clear.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.320]   SEC charges former DWAC board member
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.360]   and others for insider trading, DWAC.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.520]   - I just don't think this is the story.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.360]   This is just not the story.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.480]   - Well, no, this is the reason it was delayed.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.760]   So just to be clear,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.520]   this whole thing's been delayed
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.000]   for a couple of years because of this.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.840]   - Okay, fine.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.680]   So it was delayed.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.720]   The SEC approved it.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.080]   The company is now trading.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.840]   - Yeah, what do you think of the valuation?
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.640]   - And that's the real topic, isn't it?
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.680]   - Here's what I'll say.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.640]   I think that this is a really important watershed moment,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   and it reminds me of 1997.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.880]   Nick, throw this little image up.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.960]   In 1997, David Bowie issued
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.000]   what was then famously called the Bowie Bond.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.520]   It was $55 million that yielded 7.5%,
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.320]   which is about 80 bips above the 10-year at the time.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.480]   These were 10-year bonds.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.320]   - That's awesome.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   I didn't know that.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.120]   - The bond payments were linked to 20 albums
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.560]   that Bowie had released before 1990.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.880]   And so these are like 280 songs.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.600]   And what he basically said was like,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.360]   "Listen, folks, you're essentially buying a piece of me,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.640]   and in this case, my past work,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.720]   and I'm gonna take this $55 million up front,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.040]   and you're gonna get paid this interest
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.880]   based on the royalties that I generate
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.160]   off that historic library for a 10-year period.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.800]   We think you're gonna get paid the 55 million
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.560]   plus the 7.5% a year,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.920]   and then I'm gonna take back the rights.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.000]   And if I default, if these bonds default,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.480]   you will own the songs."
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.520]   And it turned out that it was an incredible bet.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.440]   The people that bought it, I think it was Prudential,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.200]   which was an insurance, I think it's an insurance company,
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.360]   they got paid.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.800]   The bonds did not default.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   In 2007, Bowie took back the ownership of that catalog,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.960]   of that back catalog,
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.600]   but instead what he had was 55 million up front,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.520]   which allowed him to go and buy
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.560]   all kinds of other parts of his catalog
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.760]   that he didn't otherwise own.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.840]   So why is this interesting?
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.480]   This was the first example, I think,
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.720]   of people monetizing themselves,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.680]   their name and their likeness.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.440]   In this case, it was done via debt.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.840]   I actually think when you look today,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.120]   what's happening is a more sophisticated version
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   of that movement, but at much larger scale.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.440]   I mean, we were all joking
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.560]   that there was a bunch of meme coins that launched,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.800]   not with any of our support, by the way,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   but with our names, with all these other
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.400]   quasi-famous people's names,
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   those things went up and were worth
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.200]   millions of dollars of value.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.920]   And I think what this Donald J. Trump,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.720]   the DJT company, what it represents,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.960]   is effectively a trading coin,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.360]   a baseball card, if you will,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.080]   a trading card via a stock
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.280]   on the value of Donald Trump's enterprise value,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.640]   his name, his recognition, and his likeness.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.680]   So this, I think, is the modern
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.960]   instantiation of the Bowie bond.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.680]   And what's incredible is you can see,
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.440]   Bowie, 30 or 40 years ago,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.720]   he could have generated $55 million
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.680]   in inflation-adjusted dollars.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.840]   That's about $100 billion in today's dollars.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.760]   Trump, three and a half, four billion.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.720]   I think it sits on top of this idea
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.200]   that these very famous people,
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.680]   the Kim Kardashians of the world,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.840]   the Donald Trumps of the world,
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.040]   the Mr. Beasts of the world,
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.840]   can eventually take companies public.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   And when you take a company public,
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.200]   you have to remember, Jason,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.920]   there's the revenue and the profits, right?
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.480]   But if you look at the balance sheet of a company,
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.840]   there is always a line item called goodwill.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.560]   And goodwill is what people use to separate
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.880]   the assets and the liabilities
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.080]   and whatever's left over
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.320]   to generate the shareholder equity.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.800]   So in this case, Donald Trump,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.760]   the GJT company's balance sheet
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.840]   will show a ginormous entry in goodwill.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.680]   And that is the value of his name.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.960]   Coca-Cola has such a goodwill line item,
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.160]   PepsiCo does, Gatorade does, Nike does,
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.640]   and this company does.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.480]   And I think there's gonna be a lot of other companies
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.720]   that will go public
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.360]   that effectively generate a huge goodwill line item
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.480]   that represents the name brand value
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.160]   of the person associated with it.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.200]   - So you're a buyer?
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.040]   - I'm not saying that.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.440]   I'm just saying that there is a lot of people
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.920]   that will be buyers
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.640]   that essentially will buy this as a Donald Trump,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.720]   a directional bet on the value of his brand.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.520]   And I'm also predicting that many other individuals
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.840]   will go public and have enterprise values
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.160]   that are levered in the same way as DJT.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.040]   And that is a modern version of the boy bond from '97.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.680]   - Freeberg, your thoughts on the Chamat's argument
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.000]   that this is a proxy
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.700]   for the value of Donald J. Trump's brand?
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.760]   - I think that's certainly one reason
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.640]   why people are buying the stock and driving the price up.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.400]   And another one is probably a vote
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.200]   against traditional media,
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.680]   that there is a contingent of folks
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.000]   who are basically voting with their dollars
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.240]   and saying we want an alternative
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.720]   to traditional media and traditional publishing platforms
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.320]   that have censorship that we don't agree with
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.760]   or have editorialization that we don't agree with.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.640]   And that this investment, I think,
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.440]   represents a way for them to vote
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.280]   and say, I don't want the old way, I want a new way.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.720]   And while this may or may not be the new way that succeeds,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.040]   it may or may not be a great business,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.520]   and it may or may not even have
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.480]   much viewership or usefulness,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.600]   it's a mechanism by which people can put some money down
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.760]   and say, I'm voting on an alternative,
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.000]   I wanna see an alternative.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.880]   So I do think that there's a flashpoint indication
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.280]   that arises from this
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.740]   that's more than just the memeing aspect of it,
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.320]   which is certainly fun, everyone crowds into a stock,
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.400]   stock price goes up, it's kind of like to the moon,
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.320]   and so on.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.680]   I think there's also this element
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.780]   of demand for alternative media.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.320]   There's demand for a different type of publishing platform.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.080]   And so I think that that's what this most represents to me
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.560]   from what the market is telling us perspective.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.880]   - I think there's one other thing going on here,
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   which is that this represents a populist reaction
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.620]   to the lawfare against Donald Trump,
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.120]   that I think Trump supporters want to support him
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   against all of these lawsuits
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.960]   and this persecution that he's been facing.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.360]   And I think one proof of this
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.400]   is if you turn the dial over to MSNBC,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   they've been losing their minds all week over this,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.720]   because they thought they had finally gotten the man,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.760]   there was this $450 million judgment in New York
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.720]   that he was fined for supposedly inflating the value
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.160]   of assets against which he got loans,
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.760]   even though the bank did its own independent appraisal
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.600]   of the properties,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.680]   and even though the banks fully got paid back
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.100]   and said they wanted to keep doing business with him.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.680]   So they thought they had finally gotten DJT,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.520]   and he was gonna have to pay
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.280]   hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.300]   And then lo and behold, the spat comes along
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.900]   and he makes millions and millions of dollars.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.020]   Now, that's not locked in yet.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.580]   We're still in this lockup period where for six months,
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.480]   there's a very small float.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.540]   And it's probably the case that once there's more shares
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.440]   on a liquid market,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.040]   we'll find out what the real valuation is.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.840]   So let's call the valuation we're seeing today
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.160]   based on a very small float,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.200]   let's call this more of a preliminary number,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.880]   and Trump can't sell yet.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.680]   But presumably after six months when the lockup comes off,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.920]   he'll be able to sell.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.160]   So look, I think fundamentally what's going on here
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.120]   is this is political.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.280]   Trump's enemies are angry about this spat
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.400]   because they see that it gives him a lifeline.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.680]   And I think Trump supporters
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.560]   are deliberately buying the stock to support their guy
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.880]   and to say that this lawfare against Trump
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.040]   that basically seeks to imprison the man
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.600]   or bank up the man instead of simply run against him
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.640]   is a new low in American political discourse.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.240]   And I think there's millions of people who agree with that.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.080]   And some of them are willing to buy the stock
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.720]   as a protest vote.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.600]   - I agree 100% with the protest vote.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.280]   He had what, 60, 70 million people vote for him.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.280]   He got 74%, 74 million rather, 46.8% to Biden's 81 million.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.160]   But 2% of those people want to buy the stock,
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.800]   it's a million and a half people.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.600]   And that's exactly what's happening here.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.360]   They don't care if they lose the money.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.840]   Actual value of this company with 5 million in revenue,
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.680]   4 million in yearly revenue.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.760]   I mean, if you really want it to be absolutely insane
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.360]   and give it 100X valuation, it's worth 400 million.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.160]   And so then if whatever goodwill Donald Trump's likeness is,
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.720]   maybe that's another 500 million,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.680]   but you'll lose a large amount of money,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.880]   I predict if you buy this.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.840]   And if you're buying it as a protest vote,
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.680]   sure, go for it.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.120]   - Why don't you, Jay Kyle,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.720]   why don't you short it as a J trade?
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.960]   - I never shorted a stock and I think--
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.160]   - Remember Gabe Plotkin?
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.680]   - No, who's this?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.080]   - Oh, remember from Melvin Capital?
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.920]   He thought he could--
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.400]   - He blew up his fund shorting GameStop.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.760]   - He thought he could outsmart all the apes.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.880]   - Yeah, I mean, that's exactly why I wouldn't do it.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.720]   I've never shorted.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.120]   I think that, you know, you get these Trump voters
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.360]   and it starts going up because of the small float,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.880]   which is what's happening now.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.720]   They might send this thing to $80 billion, you know,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.120]   who knows what is possible with the short float
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.760]   and a motivated, you know, million, 2 million people.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.720]   - You guys are bringing up something else as well,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   which is we've shifted from fundamental based stock trading
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.520]   being the overwhelming driver
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.480]   to there's a lot of like very speculative
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.880]   day-over-day activity that you can't control anymore.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.720]   And I think it's part and parcel of what's happening
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.200]   in other markets in America as well.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.480]   So when you look at sort of like what happened in 2016
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.960]   where the Supreme Court said
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.280]   each state can regulate sports gambling,
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.040]   all forms of like online gamesmanship and betting
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.800]   just started to skyrocket.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.040]   It could be casinos, lotteries, sports betting.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.880]   It didn't matter,
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.920]   but everything just caught a massive ginormous bid.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.760]   And when you look at the products
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.920]   that service the retail market,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.640]   they've also become increasingly gamified.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.200]   Robinhood is probably the best example
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.440]   of having built an incredibly good business
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.720]   by making things more like a game.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.080]   And then recently adding fuel to the fire
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.800]   are things like zero day options, which are just like,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.560]   and there was a big article in the Wall Street Journal
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.120]   where like one of the reporters, she became addicted to it.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.040]   And like the Wall Street Journal gave her,
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   I wanna say like a few thousand bucks,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.600]   but she had to disgorge the profits.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.160]   And she got like a 2000% return or something
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.200]   specking zero day options via Robinhood.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.680]   So the point is that on top of the whole
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.200]   movement to sort of allow individuals
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.920]   to monetize their own name and likeness
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.440]   via the stock market, which we just talked about,
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.280]   the second movement is that a lot of these things
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.080]   are becoming less financialized and more gamified.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.040]   And so you just have many more participants.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   And so to your point, you can have a GameStop moment
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.520]   in any of these things.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.000]   You can have these zero day options,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.600]   run the stock to the moon.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.120]   I would be, I would tread very lightly here.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.960]   - Yeah, and just another warning,
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   you know, the stock market bases things ultimately
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.760]   on like earnings and profits.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.400]   And so when we look at this as a proxy
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.720]   and Mr. Beast would have the same issue
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.760]   or Martha Stewart, you have a key man,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.800]   key individual risk here,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.320]   i.e. this person goes to jail, they die, whatever,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.760]   which Martha Stewart always had on her businesses.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.160]   And then what is included in this is key.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.320]   So if he does another TV show and it becomes a hit again,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.440]   is that included in this?
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.280]   No.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.160]   If he has another building
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.520]   or his buildings included in this?
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.360]   No.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.200]   The golf course is included?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.040]   No.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.920]   What's included in this, included in this deal
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.080]   when you buy DJT is apparently just a really--
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.280]   - No, you're right, Big Cal. - Fakaka crazy,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.160]   you know, social network that nobody uses.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.080]   So just be clear what you're buying.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.920]   - No, you're right.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.240]   The more sophisticated version
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.000]   of this trading card analogy would be
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   if Donald Trump contributed his brand licensing revenue
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   in perpetuity to the asset.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.800]   And then it really is a longitudinal forward bet
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.520]   on the Trump name.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.360]   - Yeah.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.480]   - And that's sort of more like if Virgin,
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.160]   like if Richard Branson took the Virgin hold co-public.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.000]   - Yes.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.560]   - That's effectively what that is as well.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.600]   Like, you know, Branson over 40 or 50 years
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.520]   has built an incredible business.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.720]   I think the stat that I heard when I got to know him
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.200]   was he's created 20 businesses
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.960]   worth at least a billion dollars or more.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.720]   Over his lifetime. - With the Virgin brand.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.600]   - With the Virgin brand.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.200]   And the Virgin brand is a licensing model
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   where he holds that right and he will license it to you
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.920]   for a share of the revenue.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.280]   That's independent of anything else
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.040]   that he may do with these businesses.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.680]   And so if he took that Virgin hold co-public,
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.720]   then what you're buying is a longitudinal discount
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.040]   of cashflow on the value of Virgin.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.160]   And to your point, if Trump contributed
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.440]   that name and likeness licensing capability into this,
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.840]   by the way, he could also still do that.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.760]   So to the extent that this business saw a contraction
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.160]   and maybe the truth social thing
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.960]   didn't end up being that valuable,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.600]   but the other aspects of the media business
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.960]   he could create by basically saying,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.040]   okay, look, this will get a share
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.080]   of my licensing revenue for my name,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.840]   would effectively be a proxy to do that.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:54.000]   So he's got a lot of outs here to maintain this market value.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.320]   And then on top of that, to your point,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.160]   there's 70 million odd people who would want to support him
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.400]   in one way, shape or form.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   - I would not go anywhere near shorting it,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.760]   given his fan base is incredibly likely
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.160]   to keep buying these shares.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.680]   And if you want to know the actual value
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.600]   of this business today, I'm an expert at this.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.320]   It's $100 million, it's $200 million.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.200]   It's not anywhere close to this.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.080]   - Put your money where your mouth is.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.560]   - No, no, we just explained it.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.880]   When you have a small float like this
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.120]   and a rabid group of people who are gambling,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.240]   you will get your face ripped off.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.920]   - You'll get plucked in. - It's absolute stupidness.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.760]   What's that?
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.920]   - You'll get plucked in.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.360]   (both laughing)
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.720]   - Yeah, I mean, it's disastrous.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   I mean, what did they say?
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.000]   We can be stupid longer than-
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   - We can be retarded longer than you can be solvent.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.920]   (both laughing)
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.760]   - The Redditors. - I mean,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.880]   it's such a great line.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.920]   I mean, but you can gamble like this on stocks,
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.080]   yet you cannot invest in private companies.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.960]   I don't get the legal system in America.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.080]   Be careful out there, folks.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.240]   You will lose a large portion of money,
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.760]   is my prediction, if you buy the stock.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.440]   But feel free if you want to gamble.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.280]   - Look, I think this is all part
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.080]   of the ongoing backlash to lawfare.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.520]   - Yeah.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.560]   - Joe Biden instructed his Justice Department
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.520]   to prosecute Trump.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.800]   In my view, it's utterly unprecedented in American history
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.880]   for one president to try and prosecute,
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.120]   imprison, and bankrupt his main opponent
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.240]   in the political election.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.400]   And there are millions of Americans
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.440]   who are absolutely disgusted by this.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.240]   I think it's a new low in American politics,
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   and God bless all the people buying these shares
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.160]   to support Trump.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.520]   This is a protest vote.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.920]   I don't know whether they're gonna make money or lose money.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.240]   Like I said, I don't think you can justify the valuation
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.400]   based on fundamentals,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.080]   but you can sure as hell justify it based on payback.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.560]   - Yeah, I mean, if you want to give your money
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.080]   to a billionaire, buy the stock, absolutely.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.920]   Feel free.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   I think probably, I agree with you,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.640]   like maybe two of the six lawsuits are a bit weak.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.520]   I think the three or four other ones,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.720]   you know, he committed the crimes
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.920]   and he's just paying the price.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.240]   But you know, we can agree to disagree on this pod.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.560]   Intelligent people do.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.680]   Speaking of intelligent people,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.720]   RFK Jr. just picked up his running mate.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.520]   This is a little bit crazy,
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.440]   and I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts on it.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.560]   He chose a 38-year-old Bay Area lawyer,
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.920]   Nicole Shanahan as his VP.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.200]   RFK explained why he chose her.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.800]   She knows big tech very well,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   how they use AI to exploit the public,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.320]   how they censor and surveil Americans,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.800]   push certain agendas.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.840]   She understands the health consequences
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.360]   of toxins in our air, soil, and food.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.080]   And he wanted a younger person
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.120]   to represent millennials and Gen Z.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.920]   He says younger generations feel like
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.320]   nobody represents them in Washington.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.080]   He also wanted an athlete in good shape
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.560]   to inspire Americans to live healthier lives.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.600]   And Shanahan donated $4 million
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.720]   in support of RFK Jr.'s Super Bowl ad
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.120]   that ran earlier this year.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.520]   Sax, what do you think of this pick?
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.720]   - Well, this pick does not excite me.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   I'll be frank.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.120]   Since I'm gonna say something critical,
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.320]   I want me to start by saying something positive
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   'cause I really, you know, I love Bobby Kennedy.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.400]   I mean, I think that he represents
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.480]   a number of really great issues that I agree with.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.400]   I mean, first of all,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.720]   he's been the most articulate critic of the Ukraine war,
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.840]   understands it deeply,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.920]   and has explained it extremely well.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.200]   He stood up for sealing the border.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.440]   He went down there, showed that it's out of control.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.720]   Completely agree.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.680]   He was a vocal critic of Fauci and lockdowns,
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.000]   was completely right about COVID.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.960]   He supports civil liberties and free speech.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.600]   So, you know, I wanna say like Bobby Kennedy is great.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.720]   The issue I have with this pick
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.640]   is that she doesn't represent any of those issues.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.560]   She has a completely different issue matrix.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.440]   And I watched her speech.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.520]   And just to say something positive about her,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.320]   I mean, I like her enthusiasm.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.200]   I think she's 38 and it's nice to have someone
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.320]   running for political office
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.240]   who's not in their 70s or 80s.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.360]   And I think she's genuine.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.960]   I actually think she's saying what she really believes.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.480]   And that's really nice and refreshing.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.640]   But again, if you go back to the issues themselves,
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.800]   she brought up three issues.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.040]   Number one is,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.960]   she says she wants to make Americans healthy again.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.280]   It's the focus on chronic disease.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.840]   I'm not saying she's wrong about that.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.240]   That's just not my issue.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.160]   Number two, she brought up criminal justice reform.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   This one concerns me.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.360]   Apparently she donated to Gascon, who's a Soros DA,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.280]   who helped destroy San Francisco
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.040]   and then failed upward to LA.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.080]   So apparently she's a Gascon supporter.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.480]   That does not fill me with confidence.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   That is a, quite frankly, luxury, liberal belief
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.240]   in this decarceration idea.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.520]   So I'm not excited about that.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.600]   Her third issue was climate and environment related,
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.840]   but in a very specific way,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.280]   she went after big agriculture.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.080]   She said, "We can no longer support
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.240]   extractive corporate agriculture."
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.120]   I'm gonna let Freeberg speak to that one.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.320]   I can't really say whether she's right or wrong,
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.760]   but that's just not one of my issues.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.280]   So listen, at the end of the day,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   I feel like this pick accentuates and underlines
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.000]   the issues in Bobby's platform
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.880]   that appeal to the left, frankly, to liberals.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.400]   And look, I think Bobby's candidacy
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.800]   is a complex candidacy that brings together
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.200]   people from both left and right.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.240]   But again, this pick does not speak to me.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.480]   It speaks to the more liberal parts of his coalition.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.880]   - Does it increase his chances?
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   And who would have been the person
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.200]   who would have increased his chances most?
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.040]   Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.600]   - Well, the person who would have been amazing
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.560]   would have been Tulsi Gabbard, okay?
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.720]   If he had chosen Tulsi-
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.560]   - Slammed him.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.120]   - That would have blown the doors off.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.960]   - Slammed him.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.920]   - Yeah, I mean, and Tulsi's been saying Chamath publicly
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.400]   that she would be proud to serve with Trump
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.280]   and it's seeming likely that she's got a shot at that, yeah?
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.800]   Being the VP for Trump?
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.920]   - I'm not gonna comment on that.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.760]   - Okay.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.040]   - Let me just say something else.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.120]   I think Tulsi Gabbard is really impressive.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.600]   I think she's independent
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.000]   and I think she really stands firmly on her own two feet
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.920]   in a way that I find inspiring.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.240]   I, like Sax, have many, many positive thoughts
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.080]   about Bobby Kennedy.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.080]   I think he is, he was really a breath of fresh air,
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.380]   Jason, in this election cycle
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.640]   because he was able to say the unsayable things
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.800]   and made those things more easy to be said by others
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.840]   and I think that there's a really important role in that
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.520]   and I think he deserves a lot of credit for that
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.240]   and then the fact that he said things
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.020]   that were so unconventional and not mainstream
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.560]   that are now mainstream views,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.800]   I think says a lot to the fact
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.000]   that he was pretty grounded in first principles
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.480]   thinking on those topics
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.240]   and I think that having those kinds of people in office
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.000]   are really good for America.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.940]   All of that said, I do agree with David
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:11.140]   that I think the pick was meant to be more
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.420]   about covering his left flank
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.280]   and I found that an odd calculation
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.160]   and I wonder whether it wouldn't have been easier
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.980]   to cover the right flank
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.720]   and there are different folks
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.480]   that could have been in the mix to do that
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.040]   and so I think that it was a calculation though
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.840]   and I think it's about, he has a core set of issues,
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.760]   it's about whether he appeals more to this side
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.400]   or to this side in order to get the totality of the votes
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.720]   that he think is possible.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.400]   Second, he was under a little bit of a time constraint
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.800]   because some of these states need the VP candidate named
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.600]   and he's under a shot clock that the other two are not.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.440]   So, I mean, I wish Bobby the best
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.720]   because I think some combination of Bobby doing well
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:05.600]   and some upheaval between the Democrats and the Republicans
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.880]   is really the only chance we have
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.440]   of having a credible third party.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.080]   Well, let's see now what happens.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.320]   By the way, we should just say like,
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.360]   Joe Lieberman passed away
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.080]   which is really unfortunate.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.960]   He was a really independent thinker as well.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.380]   Let's see what No Labels really does here.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.480]   There's a little bit of chaos over at No Labels, I think,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.160]   but so there's a lot of moving parts.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   So, it was clearly calculus.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.920]   I don't totally understand what that formula was though.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.000]   - Just to build on something Jamal said,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.040]   there's a report by Colin Rugg
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.920]   that the DNC realizes what Jamal said
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.640]   about this covering Bobby's left flank
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.680]   rather than his right flank.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.600]   And apparently they're in somewhat of a panic about this.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.080]   And I think what you're gonna see
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.320]   is that lawyers from the DNC and the Biden campaign
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.160]   are gonna fight tooth and nail
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.800]   to keep this ticket off the ballot,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.760]   at least in the major contested states,
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.280]   like the five or six states
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.360]   where the presidency will be decided in 2024.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.600]   And of course, they'll be saying
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.200]   they're doing this to save democracy.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.880]   But you're gonna see, I think,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.680]   a full court press by DNC lawyers
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.240]   to keep the Kennedy-Shanahan ticket off the ballot.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   - Yeah, this seems really like it's gonna damage Biden,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.840]   which was my original prediction.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.960]   And that reason why a lot of the right wing
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.800]   were supporting RFK was because they wanted,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.240]   they saw this as a clear path
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.240]   to take away a couple of points from Biden.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   And it seems like that's what's happening.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.400]   - First part of what you said is 100% right.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.000]   I'm not sure that a bunch of Republicans
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.480]   are gonna get organized, Jekyll,
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.640]   to vote for RFK in that way.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.880]   - Oh, no, I don't think they're gonna do that.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.440]   I think they supported him publicly
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.880]   in order to build him up as a centrist candidate,
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.240]   knowing that it would take away from Biden.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.720]   So I just think on a strategic political basis,
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.560]   all these Republicans-
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.600]   - They didn't do that for Marianne Williamson.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.440]   Why not?
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.680]   - Yeah, no, she's not electable.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.280]   Yeah, no, it's 'cause she's not electable.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.120]   I mean, she's like- - By the way-
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.320]   - Into crystals and not like a viable candidate.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.960]   It's pretty clear she's not viable.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.840]   - Why can't you just accept that people on the right
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.800]   like the issues that Bobby spoke to?
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.640]   Isn't that the simplest explanation for-
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.400]   - Yeah, no, I don't, 'cause I think that they're partisans
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   and they just wanna win.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.640]   So I don't think it has anything to do
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.480]   with what you were saying,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.960]   which would be like authentically liking
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.440]   and connecting with what he's saying.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.280]   I don't think it was that.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.360]   I think it's a strategic plan to try to pull Biden votes.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.440]   And I think Republicans are smart for doing that.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.280]   - You think Bobby's a plant?
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.320]   You think he's a plant?
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.840]   - I think their support for him is for nefarious reasons.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.160]   They're supporting him to take votes away from Biden.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.200]   And here it is.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.000]   We're all agreeing that this is gonna take votes away
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.840]   from Biden.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.400]   So I think it's a very clever strategy on the GOP's part.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.960]   - Well, hold on, just to add one point to that.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.120]   Remember that when Bobby entered the race,
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.280]   he did so as a Democrat.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.400]   He did so challenging Joe Biden
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.120]   for the nomination of the Democratic Party.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.720]   How did the Democratic Party react?
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.640]   They kept him off the ballot.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.180]   They wouldn't give him a fair shot.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.640]   That's why he went independent.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.840]   So he did not have to be this sort of,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.160]   well, you're kind of implying like a fly
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.080]   in the ointment type third-party candidate.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.000]   He tried to be the Democratic candidate.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.400]   They wouldn't let him compete.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.240]   If they had let him compete in a fair way,
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.800]   maybe he would have stayed a Democrat.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.320]   - I would have loved to have a massive
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.660]   competitive field of Democrats.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.880]   I think the Democrats are screwing this up big time.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.560]   I think this could be the most,
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.000]   I think you could peel off a couple of percentage points.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.760]   Yeah, in those four states.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.600]   - I think you're right.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.800]   - I think it's more than that.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.000]   So, I mean, I think it's more than that.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.640]   - So we all agree that's what's happening here.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.400]   But then we're just disagreeing on tactics.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.240]   - I think this is where--
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.000]   - We agree it's taking points away, yeah.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.280]   - I think we agree about that.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.180]   But what I'm saying is that this is where we've ended up.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.280]   I don't think it was constructed to be this way.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.240]   - Huh, interesting.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.480]   Freeberg, your thoughts on this candidate
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.600]   specifically around her love of organic food
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.200]   and wanting to take on the pesticides, toxic food,
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.080]   and the industrial food complex.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.840]   - I remain steadfast in my commitment
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.760]   to there being only one major issue facing this country,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.880]   and that is the federal debt and the deficit.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.320]   We are increasing the federal debt
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.640]   by a trillion dollars every hundred days.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.480]   That number is not slowing down.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.440]   The current budget proposal from the Biden administration
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.360]   calls for over $7.2 trillion to be spent next year.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.400]   That makes the US federal government
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.560]   roughly one third of our country's GDP.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.040]   The outrageousness of the condition
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:34.040]   that the US is in right now makes it so insane to me
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.760]   that we are talking about any other topic
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.560]   like big agriculture or whatever other nonsense
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.800]   was being spattered about as important topics
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.240]   to this particular person.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   If every voting citizen of the United States
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   does not recognize the severity
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.680]   of the deficit and debt problem
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.600]   that the federal government faces,
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.480]   you are wasting your vote.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.880]   And no candidate is speaking
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.760]   to what is clearly the biggest issue of our time,
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.440]   and we need to address this issue headlong.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.720]   So I don't care about this person
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.840]   or anyone else who's running for office
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.200]   that is talking about stuff
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.800]   that we cannot actually address
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.760]   and problems we cannot actually solve
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.520]   if we don't get our fiscal affairs in order.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.720]   That's my point of view.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.760]   - Got it, and respect for that.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   Can anybody win the presidency on a,
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.120]   hey, we're gonna balance the budget,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.240]   we're gonna cut spending platform?
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.400]   - Nope.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.520]   - So they can't win, and it's an existential issue.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.880]   - That's why I look, I mean,
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.120]   I'll keep shouting into the abyss.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.960]   - I hope, yeah.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.800]   - That a few people hear it
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.360]   and that at some point it becomes a topic
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.600]   that folks do begin to focus on.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.600]   I think that the necessity of raising tax rates,
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.480]   the necessity ultimately of cutting entitlement programs,
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.800]   the necessary inflation that will arise
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.280]   because of the condition
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.440]   of the federal government's debt level,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.960]   because we're gonna have to keep printing money.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.280]   These are the sorts of things that are like a boiling pot
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.240]   that one day folks will wake up and say,
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.280]   well, what the heck happened?
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.360]   Everything got mismanaged.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.880]   And it's not a Democrat problem.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.520]   It's not a Republican problem.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.200]   It's a fundamental problem
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.360]   of people voting themselves all the money
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.440]   and people getting voted into office by saying,
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.400]   I'm gonna do more than is being done today.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.800]   And that costs money.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   And no one actually addresses the rampant misuse of funds,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.000]   the lack of accountability in spending,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.840]   and the fact that we have an incredible amount
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.320]   of negative ROI spending,
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.480]   and the fact that we've effectively created an economy
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.960]   that's fundamentally dependent on federal spending.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.280]   And I'll go through some statistics
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.680]   when we talk about Biden's budget later in the show,
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.000]   but I think that the significance is just overlooked
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.320]   by all of these candidates.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.120]   And we're not really talking about the thing that matters.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.600]   - All right, so let's break down
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.400]   Biden's proposed budget of 2025.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.560]   Proposed budget was 7.3 trillion for fiscal 2025.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.520]   That starts in October of 2024.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.160]   It's up 18% from 2023.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.680]   Projected deficit, 1.78 trillion,
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.080]   which is similar to the deficits we ran in '23 and '24.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.960]   The budget projects an average deficit
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.840]   of 1.6 trillion per year over the next decade.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.240]   National debt, as Freeberg was alluding to, is insane.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.760]   It's at 34.5 trillion.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.720]   But we made some charts here to go through all of this.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.760]   Let's pull up the first chart.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.960]   And this is comparing Biden's proposed budget in 2025
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.640]   with budgets from 2005 and 2015.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.560]   Defense spending has actually grown pretty modestly
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.640]   during that time, but entitlements, interest payments,
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   and non-defense spending have jumped significantly.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.320]   US will owe 965 billion in interest on its debt next year.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.600]   That's 65 billion more than the pro's defense budget.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.720]   And in 2026, the US will surpass 1 trillion
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.840]   on interest owed on its debt.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.440]   And we'll talk about that more in a minute,
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   but let's start here with this first chart.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.920]   Anything jump out to you, Chamath, here
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.800]   that's notable and worth discussing?
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.720]   - All the areas that we need to cut,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.640]   we can't even have a conversation about,
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.080]   so they'll never get cut and they'll keep growing.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.320]   So I think that we probably need to figure out
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.960]   what the alternatives are.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.840]   So if you can't have a conversation about expenses,
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.160]   the only logical place is to have a conversation
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.720]   about revenues and what that means
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.920]   for the government is in taxation.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.600]   And so I don't know, Jason, what we do here.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   There could be a couple of saving graces.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.960]   So there are some things happening,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.080]   for example, on the Medicare side
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.960]   that could be profoundly disruptive.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.360]   They are, now, again, I'm just gonna put this out there
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.920]   as it's happening, I don't know if it's good or bad,
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.000]   but they are looking at reimbursing things like Wigovi
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.680]   and Ozempic and whatnot.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.320]   If you look at the underlying costs
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.400]   of those kinds of chronic diseases,
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.480]   diabetes, heart disease, et cetera,
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   and you put a large swath of the American population
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.040]   on those drugs, the reimbursement value of those drugs
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.760]   versus the cost of actually the chronic care management
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.960]   would save you many hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.720]   So that's something.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.120]   Second is on the defense side,
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.600]   there's a large portion of that budget
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.640]   that's migrating away from traditional tactical warfare
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.400]   to things that are unmanned vehicles
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.520]   and cyber and whatnot.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.120]   That could save two or $300 billion there.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.160]   So there are places where you could save
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.880]   500 billion to a trillion dollars.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.120]   But I think it's gonna be a almost impossible conversation
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.400]   and it'll happen by accident.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.320]   So then the only forced conversation
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.160]   that I think we are going to have as a society
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.640]   is around taxation.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.800]   And that's really bad for a lot of people
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.240]   that don't believe that's the path to generating growth.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.600]   - One of the challenges is that there are,
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.920]   and we should reference these in the show notes, Nick,
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.560]   but there are well-researched economic studies
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.480]   that show that when a government
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.400]   tries to increase the taxation level
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.360]   north of 20% of GDP of that economy,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.600]   that you actually see GDP growth go negative,
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   that there's a certain natural equilibrium
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.560]   on which you can tax the system.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.760]   Beyond that level, investment dollars go down
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.240]   and growth begins to shrink.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.520]   And that's what triggers the spiraling problem
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.320]   'cause then the government spending needs to go up
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.640]   to continue to grow and support growth in the economy.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   And it creates this inevitable spiraling.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.480]   - Would you call this the Atlas Shrug?
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.920]   The Atlas Shrug effect is investment goes down.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   - There's a Fred chart showing percent of GDP
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.760]   that's federal tax receipts
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.200]   and then percent of GDP that's spending.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.040]   - Exactly.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.440]   - And then the gap is your deficit, okay?
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.280]   And Freeberg's right that I think
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.640]   in the absolute best economy,
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   or best years of the best economy,
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.040]   so it's like the best year of the Reagan boom
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.720]   and the best year of the Clinton boom
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.480]   when we had the government surplus,
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.400]   I think the government was extracting
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.120]   just shy of 20% of GDP.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.480]   And in the '70s when marginal tax rates were at 70%,
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.240]   so before the Reagan tax cuts,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.840]   we were actually extracting a lower percentage of GDP.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.000]   So there's only so much blood you can get from a stone.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.200]   If you raise tax rates on a marginal basis high enough,
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.520]   the economy performs worse
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.920]   and you actually end up collecting less
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.360]   or people spend a lot more money on lawyers and accountants
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.240]   to basically figure out more structuring schemes
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.320]   to avoid paying taxes.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.400]   So the years in which we've got the highest percentage
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   of revenue out of the economy are in good economic years
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.760]   where we've had reasonable levels of taxation
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.080]   as opposed to the highest levels of taxation.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.600]   And so the problem is with the spending.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.640]   I mean, we used to be able to keep spending
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:03.280]   to somewhere between, I'd say in the best years of,
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.720]   the years of the Clinton surplus,
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:09.120]   I think spending as a percent of GDP was like 18.8%.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.520]   It's around 20% of GDP goes to federal spending.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.600]   That was normal.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.720]   But then the spending got out of control during COVID
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.960]   and it went up to like 25, 30% of GDP
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.240]   went to federal spending.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   It's starting to come down,
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.880]   but it's still way too big a number.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.920]   Anyway, my point is that a starting point
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.960]   for dealing with next year's budget is free spending,
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.640]   just free spending.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.560]   You know, the 18% increase is not a good idea.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.320]   If we wanna get this problem under control,
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.840]   freeze the spending, we can talk about taxation,
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.440]   but you're only gonna get so much blood from the stone.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.280]   - And increased spending is stimulatory.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.520]   And so it works well in an election year.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.040]   I would say we took two major crises
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.320]   and we had crisis level spending,
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.920]   and then we normalized that spending
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.520]   and allowed it to carry forward,
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.360]   starting with the '08 financial crisis
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.360]   with our monetary policy,
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.200]   and then being accelerated with COVID
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.640]   and our fiscal policy.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.600]   I'll give you guys,
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.480]   I did some back of the envelope math.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.560]   I'm sure there are economists
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.600]   who have done a better job of this than I.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.520]   There are directly 3 million Americans
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.800]   that are directly employed by the federal government.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.280]   There's 167 million workers in the US.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.800]   So 3 million are directly employed
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.120]   by the federal government.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   If you take the rest of the federal spending
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.280]   that flows into the economy,
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   it's about three and a half trillion a year,
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.080]   and assume 30% of that capital
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.240]   goes to equity holders and businesses
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   that own businesses that benefit from that spending,
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.920]   and the rest flows through to labor,
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.040]   that's about 13% of GDP flowing through to labor.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.120]   And assuming average annual income,
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.480]   that's another roughly 45, 50 million people
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.720]   that are directly benefiting,
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.320]   that are directly earning income
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.800]   because of federal spending.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.880]   There's another 50 million people in the US
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.480]   that rely on social security.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.160]   And here's another important statistic.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.600]   There's somewhere between 12 and 20 million people
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   in the US that pay more than 50% tax rate today.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.480]   So those people are effectively working
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.840]   for the federal government
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.320]   because half of their income goes back to the government.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.560]   So when you add this all up,
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.280]   there's over 100, 120 million people in the US
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   that are directly working for or getting paid
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.560]   by the federal government in the US.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.280]   That is such a significant percentage of our economy.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.600]   That is such a significant dependency
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.880]   on individual income on a federal government.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.400]   I don't wanna use the term socialism,
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.520]   but the ability for US labor to earn
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.200]   is so largely dependent and largely driven
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.960]   by federal spending at this point.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.400]   It becomes this critical linchpin
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:44.000]   to enabling progression economically,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.760]   to enabling the labor force to continue to participate,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.600]   that the federal government is now the primary customer
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.800]   or employer of most of the labor force
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.160]   in the United States today.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.440]   That is a deeply and profoundly different circumstance
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.800]   than what I think the founding fathers envisioned
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.480]   when the federal government was supposed to be
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:07.120]   this lightweight overseeing organization
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.200]   of a federated republic of states.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.040]   And unfortunately, I think we find ourselves
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.920]   in a condition, as Jamal points out,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.400]   that's very hard to get out of.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.800]   This is gonna require a dedicated multi-decade effort
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.600]   to create a slow unwinding from this deep dependency
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.440]   that our labor force has on federal spending.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.200]   And I'm just like so shocked
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.920]   that this isn't the critical problem of our day
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.160]   that we're not all spending time on.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.800]   Folks have pointed out that this only goes one way
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.920]   at this point.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.160]   - Hey, Nick, can you bring up that first Fred chart?
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.640]   This is federal receipts as percent of GDP,
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.000]   and it goes all the way back to World War II.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.760]   To Freeberg's point, we've never gone above 20%.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.600]   Look at that.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.960]   And we've had tax rates as high as 90%.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.920]   I'm saying top marginal tax rates as high as 90%,
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.280]   I think, after World War II,
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.120]   'cause we're trying to get out of the deficit
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.880]   that was created by the war spending.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.600]   - You can't get above 20.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.920]   - The economy shrinks.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:04.200]   - No, but hold on, I gave you this OECD report.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   It says that since 2000, we've been in the mid-20s.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.360]   And the OECD average is 34 in terms of tax to GDP.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.160]   - Tax to GDP, this includes state and local then, right?
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.440]   - Probably, yeah.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.640]   - Yeah, I just showed federal.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.680]   - I think this probably includes state and local.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.720]   Which, by the way, is a whole nother Bollywood,
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.040]   'cause I didn't include those numbers
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.240]   in my employment statistics.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.880]   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.440]   that about 20.2 million Americans are employed
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.280]   by local and state governments,
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.360]   directly employed by local and state governments.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.880]   So again, when you add this all up,
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.000]   the majority of the U.S. labor force
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.600]   is employed by the government,
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   or is a beneficiary of the government
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   as the primary customer,
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.840]   or is supported by government entitlement programs.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.760]   - If you go back to that Fred chart for a second,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.080]   I mean, if you basically acknowledge the point
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.240]   that 20% is the ceiling on how much we can extract
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   from an economy based on 80 years of data, okay,
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.120]   with all sorts of differing tax schemes,
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.360]   then I think what we should say is
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:14.760]   that federal spending will be capped at 20% of GDP.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.600]   - Yeah.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.440]   - We should, you see what I'm saying?
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.120]   Like, if we can't go above 20% on receipts.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.320]   - Always, that's it, that's it.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.160]   - Cap federal spending at 20%.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.560]   - That should be a constitutional amendment.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.400]   - Right.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.240]   - That's it.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.920]   - And then on the revenue side,
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.720]   we should say, what is the best tax code
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:33.360]   to achieve that 18, 19, 20%?
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.960]   Because what we do right now is we just say,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.920]   well, just tax the rich.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.600]   But what we've seen is we've been taxing the rich
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.480]   as high as 90% in the past,
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.200]   and you didn't get more revenue.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.120]   So we should be much more scientific about saying,
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.760]   well, given that our target is, let's say 20%,
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.560]   what's the best way to do that?
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.240]   And no one really has that conversation.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.000]   - No, none of the conversations have to do with data
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.520]   or building a bulletproof system.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.240]   The same thing we could say about immigration,
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.440]   where we try to talk about the numbers here
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.600]   of what's a reasonable number of people
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.240]   and tying that to an actual number,
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.000]   and it's pretty obvious,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.360]   we should have one immigration policy
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.840]   when we have 5% unemployment and a different one
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.240]   if we had, God forbid, 15 or 20% unemployment.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.080]   - Rick, can we just stay on budget for a second?
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   - It could be tied to the unemployment rate.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.800]   - The fundamental structural problem I'm highlighting
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.880]   is that we've created an economy
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.000]   that is so deeply dependent on federal spending,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.480]   that the federal spending levels are what support
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.680]   so many employed and so many companies in the US.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.080]   - You're answering your own question.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.480]   That's why I can't stop.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.320]   - Right.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.480]   - I don't think the real economy
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.640]   that creates all the innovation and all the value
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.680]   and all the good-paying jobs,
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.000]   I think that is separate
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.840]   from what the government does.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:49.680]   - That's the deflationary economy.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.520]   That's the true market-based deflationary economy.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.600]   The problem is once we've layered in
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.480]   all of these layers of dependency from federal dollars
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.320]   flowing into businesses or into people's pockets,
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.360]   it's very difficult to back out of that.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.560]   - I don't call that dependency.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.000]   I call that special interests.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.240]   I think there's a lot of special interests
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.760]   who are basically looting the federal government
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.840]   and taking all this money
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.000]   and then they turn around and use some of it
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.960]   to donate back to the politicians
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.680]   and lobby for more spending.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.040]   So what you're calling dependency
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.520]   is really more special interests,
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.440]   meaning that I don't think we need
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.640]   to have this level of spending
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.360]   in order to have a successful economy.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.520]   I think it makes our economy less successful.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.360]   - Yeah.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.520]   - It's still stimulatory.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.440]   'Cause Zach, remember Mitch McConnell,
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.480]   when they were talking about supporting Ukraine,
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.320]   his primary argument, as you remember,
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.560]   was that all of these dollars
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   are gonna go into defense contractors' pockets,
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.320]   which is gonna go to employees' pockets,
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.080]   which is gonna stimulate our economy.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.360]   That's the fundamental thinking kind of.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.680]   - But that doesn't create value.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.520]   That doesn't create value. - I know,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.840]   but that's the thinking behind it, right?
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.440]   I mean, that's the political system that--
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.440]   - Okay, let me just walk through this real quick.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.960]   If the government prints a bunch of money
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.640]   and hands it to people as STEMI checks,
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.040]   we all understand that creates no economic value,
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.200]   it just creates inflation.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.880]   Okay, now, if the government does the same thing,
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.800]   but instead of a STEMI check,
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.960]   pays people to dig holes and fill them back up,
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.960]   that's the exact same thing.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.160]   No economic value, just inflation.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.600]   Now, let's say the government pays people
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   to create bombs that create holes in other countries,
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.920]   exact same thing.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.280]   No economic value for the country,
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.920]   it just creates inflation here.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.760]   Why is that?
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.080]   Because the only thing that creates economic value
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.440]   in the United States is the production of goods
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.720]   and services that people can actually consume
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.920]   and use and that they want.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.880]   And so federal spending on basically make work projects
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.960]   or things that people don't really want
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.320]   or they don't use, or even worse,
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.840]   bombs that get dropped on poor people in other countries,
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.720]   none of that creates any value.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.880]   But I don't think it's a real economic dependency.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.840]   I think it is just a special interest
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.040]   that keeps lobbying for all this stuff.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.800]   - But Saj, what about housing and healthcare and education?
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.760]   'Cause those are the three biggest line items
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.800]   and it's been inflationary across all three
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.880]   of those line items in the US economy.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.120]   The federal government has stepped in
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.160]   to provide broader access to housing,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.640]   broader access to healthcare,
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.280]   and broader access to education.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.360]   And in the process--
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.920]   - That's why the price goes up.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.880]   You know, there's that famous chart showing
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.040]   inflation by category and all the categories
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.640]   where the federal government provides subsidies,
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.920]   the prices have gone up.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.760]   And all the categories--
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.720]   - Education, healthcare.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.560]   - Yeah. - And housing.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.400]   - And housing.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.000]   - The more the government tries to subsidize it,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.360]   the more the providers realize,
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.080]   "Wait a second, we can charge whatever we want
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.920]   "because the government's paying."
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.760]   - That's correct, that's correct.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.440]   There's one customer and they'll always pay.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.280]   - Yeah. - There's one customer.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.640]   - So that's gotta be completely reformed.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.000]   - Yeah, here's a chart of all employees in government.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   And I think this FRED chart includes
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.120]   all employees in government,
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.680]   which would include state and local.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.800]   And as you can see, we're--
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.640]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.320]   It's 20 million local and state, three million federal.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.720]   And then the math I was highlighting
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.600]   was just my back of the envelope math
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.360]   where there's 50 million people
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.320]   that are on social security in the US.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.840]   Plus, if you do the math on how government spending
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.800]   flows into employees' pockets,
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.440]   it's about another 45, 50 million people
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.480]   that benefit from federal spending in the US.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.880]   We're already kind of at a point
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.960]   of maximal dependency, if you will.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.240]   - Yeah, I mean, if you look at this chart,
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.960]   we have had 20,000 people working in government
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.520]   since the late '90s. - 20 million.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.480]   - Yeah, 20 million since the late '90s.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.960]   It's now hitting a peak.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.200]   And the question is, how far up does it go from here?
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.240]   It's 23.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.160]   Obviously, the country is growing as well each year.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.720]   So as a percentage, we don't have the percentage,
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.040]   but as a percentage of Americans,
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.920]   it hasn't grown that dramatically.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.520]   But it certainly feels like this could keep going
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.560]   in the wrong direction.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.640]   - The one thing to keep in mind from all the doomsdaying,
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.600]   I would just offer you two data points.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.960]   The first is that our debt to GDP,
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.040]   either historically but also in relation to other countries,
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.880]   is still relatively reasonable.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.440]   And what that basically shows is we have a lot more debt
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.320]   that we can't issue,
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.400]   which means that there's a lot more deficits to run.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.480]   Not saying that it's right.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.320]   - Yeah, before the great financial crisis,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   it was running at 50, 60% our debt as a percentage of GDP.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.920]   And to your point, Shamaf, it's now at 1.2.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.040]   It's 120%.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.000]   Other countries have much higher.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.040]   So we have a lot more to run.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.400]   Yeah, so Nick, if you want to just throw that up.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.920]   So it means that the countries on the right haven't failed.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.440]   They haven't done great necessarily,
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.360]   but they haven't failed
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.240]   in the way that we would define failure.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.360]   And it's not as if the countries on the left are crushing it
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.760]   the way that we would define crushing it.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.920]   And so it's not clear that there's a real correlation
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.880]   between debt to GDP and the performance
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.800]   over large longitudinal periods of times as a country.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.360]   That's the first thing I'll say.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.200]   The second thing is,
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.480]   if you actually look at all of these countries,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.560]   the thing to keep in mind
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.720]   is where our population's growing and shrinking.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.800]   Because at a very basic level,
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.600]   Jekyll, you mentioned this earlier,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.280]   but when countries are shrinking,
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.800]   there's no fundamental ability to grow GDP.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.320]   And you're just debating how much it shrinks.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.520]   And the interesting thing about the United States
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   is we are the only Western country
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.480]   that is forecasted to grow at reasonable rates
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.880]   above our replacement population.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.360]   And so by the end of this century,
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.840]   we'll be around 400, 400 odd million individuals,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.080]   and other countries will have been cut in half.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.280]   And so again, there's some positive news as well.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.960]   Now, to your earlier point,
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.640]   the problem is politicians will use this
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.240]   as a reason to continue spending
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.880]   because they won't be forced to.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.920]   And that's not a great thing,
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.560]   but this is probably why the status quo
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.160]   will go on for a very long time.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.920]   - So grab the bag, get your bag.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.840]   Figure out what your thing is.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.680]   - I don't know, man.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.520]   I just want people, like voters to,
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.320]   people to just understand. - They're not going to.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.680]   - Yeah. - They're not going to.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.280]   Get your bag, like everybody else is.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.320]   - The problem we have is if,
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.960]   okay, Nick, can you pull up the Fred spending chart?
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.720]   - We've talked about this a few times.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.520]   - Well, okay, so if you look there,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.320]   there was a huge spike because of COVID,
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   because of all that COVID stimulus
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.480]   that was airdropped to the economy.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.280]   I think we're now down to about 22% for 2023,
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.960]   but that's a big number.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.920]   We talked about how the absolute max
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.360]   you can extract is 20%.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.400]   So what they should do is just freeze spending
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.520]   until the federal net outlays as a percent of GDP
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.200]   is down to 20%.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.400]   That would be the simplest thing.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.000]   - Such an easy solution.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.760]   What's great about it is it takes out the politicians
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.520]   making this partisan.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.800]   Hey, there is a logical amount of taxation we can do
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:48.640]   before we freeze up the productivity of the country,
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.200]   which if you talk to anybody, when taxes get high,
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.920]   people just start getting, protecting their wealth.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.000]   I think you alluded to that with strategies
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.360]   as opposed to investing.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.200]   - The hard part of it is that,
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.760]   I mean, look, I think we should do it,
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.280]   20% cap and freeze spending until we get there.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.080]   The hard part is that our interest expense keeps growing
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.000]   because as our debt rolls onto more expensive,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.440]   higher interest bonds,
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.520]   then our interest expense is increasing.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.360]   Just a few years ago,
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.920]   our interest expense was only 300 billion a year.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.400]   Now it's over a trillion a year.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.440]   And that's just going to keep growing and growing.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.720]   And then the other thing that's going to grow
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.600]   is all the entitlements related to demographics.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.960]   So the country's demographics are getting worse.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.440]   And so the entitlement expenses are going to go up.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.800]   So even holding it to 20%,
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.480]   if we could get there, it's going to take some work.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.280]   - I don't know if you read Larry Fink's letter
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.120]   from BlackRock.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.760]   It was really good and he talked about-
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.240]   - You mean his 2030 business plan, Jacob?
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.120]   - Basically, yeah.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.160]   It's his way of extracting value from it.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.880]   But he did make some salient points in it
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.120]   as opposed to just him talking his book
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.200]   of why you should do your retirement savings
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.240]   with BlackRock is a fair point.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.880]   But just getting the, what age do people retire at?
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.880]   That discussion we need to have,
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.080]   and we're not having that as a country.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.520]   And then what percentage of benefits do people get
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.000]   at different, how do we incentivize people
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.600]   to stay in the workforce?
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.080]   - Well, at a minimum, don't you agree
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.360]   we should just allow people to opt out of social security
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.640]   and in a simple way of saying, I don't need it.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.560]   And I'll take care of myself,
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.440]   use these proceeds for somebody else that could use it,
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.520]   that who has a better need for it.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.320]   - Yeah, I mean, and then getting people
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.400]   to participate in the 401ks at an earlier age
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.000]   and defaulting those to on as a defaulting them to off.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.520]   There's a lot of small behavioral things we could do
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.360]   in this country to get people saving earlier.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.640]   - Wow.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.200]   - I saw that Robinhood was running a scheme
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.280]   where if you moved your Roth IRA,
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.320]   they gave you 3% cash back.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.120]   And I thought, is there an upper bound limit
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.600]   on how much you could move over?
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.440]   'Cause I wonder if I could just-
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.680]   - I think you have to keep your money in there
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.320]   for five years.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.160]   - But that's okay.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.560]   I'm just wondering like, will they really write
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.120]   like a hundred million dollar check
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.800]   if you move like a five million dollar Roth over?
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.280]   - Robinhood just sent me something.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.800]   So we had a portfolio company called X1,
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.480]   which was making a new like credit card and credit card app.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480]   It was like, awesome.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.160]   I don't know if you guys used it.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.880]   Anyway, they got acquired by Robinhood.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.160]   And so the guys here just sent me
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.240]   their new Robinhood gold card here.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.200]   - Gold card, yeah.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.880]   - This thing is the heaviest card here.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.960]   Just listen to it drop.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.880]   Hold on.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.720]   Let me get a towel.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.560]   - Don't cut yourself.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.680]   - Don't cut your towel off.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.840]   (laughing)
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.800]   - Apparently it's got $1,100 worth of gold in it.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.160]   - I have one company myself
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.600]   and I'm proud to say I've sold no shares of my Robinhood.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.400]   I keep all my Robinhood shares.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.040]   If I move my Roth IRA,
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.040]   they'll have to give me the whole building.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.680]   - They'll give you a gold-plated building?
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.320]   - Actually, they sent it to me in a Louis Vuitton,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.840]   with a Louis Vuitton wallet.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.400]   This is like unbelievable.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.360]   Yes, it's got-
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.960]   - And look, they got a $50,000 ad on it.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.480]   - They got a $50,000 ad on the clothing.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.320]   - Look at this.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.680]   You got like a little LV wallet there.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.520]   - Oh, I like it.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.360]   - There you have it, folks.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   Send a Louis Vuitton wallet,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.360]   get a free $50,000 ad on the pod.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.160]   Sign up now for your Robinhood gold.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.960]   - Yeah.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.800]   - But what is it, a credit card?
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.640]   - Yes, a credit card.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.480]   - It's a credit card.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.300]   - Yeah.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.140]   - Their whole plan was always to-
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:15.980]   - This is hype.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.440]   - Provide the full suite of services.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.880]   Do you guys carry credit cards and money?
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.000]   Do you have any money?
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.880]   - I keep forgetting my wallet,
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.360]   but I always carry money.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.280]   - You have money?
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.120]   - I always carry money.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.360]   - You know, like to tip people or something?
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.520]   - Always have some cash-ish.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.320]   Never, you always gotta have a couple hundy,
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   just in case.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.400]   It's a really bad habit.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.280]   You gotta keep a couple hundy in the bag.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.400]   - You put the hundred on the outside,
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.840]   J. Cal, and there's a bunch of ones.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.800]   (laughing)
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.200]   - No, we don't do that.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.640]   You get caught doing that in Brooklyn,
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.480]   you get your ass in-
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.600]   - Got the brazol on the outside.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.200]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.640]   What we do is we get rid of the ones,
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.720]   the fives and the tens.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.560]   You just get rid of those.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.120]   You don't even keep them in circulation.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.800]   That's the best line.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.080]   I get cash when I go to Vegas,
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.200]   but that's it.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.600]   - The best line ever was,
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.640]   woman comes up to Sammy Davis Jr.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.480]   and she says,
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.480]   "Hey, can you break this whatever amount of money?"
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:14.040]   And he just pulls out a hundy and gives her a hundred.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.600]   And she says, "No, no, can you make change?"
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.760]   He says, "That is change, baby.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.600]   That is change."
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.840]   And that's when he considered change was the hundy.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.360]   - There's a story out of Jeju,
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.320]   so you know Triton poker?
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.440]   - Yes.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440]   - Okay, I'm not gonna say who it is,
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.720]   but there's a guy that was playing the high stakes cash game
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.560]   and apparently,
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.000]   so he lost like 8 million bucks, okay?
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.960]   He tipped out 450K and 25K chips to like the staff
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.520]   and like the person giving him a massage and stuff.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.000]   So it apparently became a free for all
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.120]   trying to get into this game where everybody was like,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.160]   "Are we pulling tips?
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.000]   Are we pulling tips?"
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.120]   And they were like, "No, we're not pulling tips."
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.280]   Just flags.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.800]   He was tipping off flags.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.640]   - Wow.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.320]   - That is incredibly, incredibly generous.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.000]   - All right, science corner, rapid fire.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.840]   You wanted to get to cocoa.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.040]   Here we are.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.440]   We're at cocoa.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.280]   Freeberg?
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.480]   You have the floor.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.720]   - You guys asked about cocoa.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.520]   You wanna pull up the commodity price chart on cocoa?
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.360]   Look at that.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.200]   - Okay.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.040]   This is not cocaine.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:17.880]   This is cocoa.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.720]   This is chocolate.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.760]   Precursor to chocolate.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.600]   Not cocaine.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.440]   - This is chocolate.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.880]   As you guys can see from this chart,
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.320]   cocoa has moved in price from about 2,000 bucks a ton,
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.760]   which is where it normally trades at,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.000]   to $10,000 a ton.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   70% of cocoa is grown in West Africa,
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.520]   in Ghana and Ivory Coast.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.400]   And in that area,
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.160]   they've been severely hit by this El Nino weather year
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.840]   that we're just kind of coming out of.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.440]   So here's all the cocoa production.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.040]   73% of it's in Africa,
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.440]   mostly in Ghana and Ivory Coast.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.280]   That's where most of the world's cocoa beans are produced.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.040]   Cocoa is grown from the cacao tree,
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.320]   which is about 10 feet tall.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   These bean pods,
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.160]   you take them down,
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.400]   you roast the beans,
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.240]   crush it,
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.080]   you make cocoa.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.080]   When you eat a Hershey's bar,
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:03.920]   for example,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.320]   11% of that bar is ground up cocoa powder.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.960]   So cocoa is like the critical ingredient
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.520]   in all the chocolate products we consume.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.040]   So we had this massive El Nino event last year.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.320]   So here you can see sea surface temperatures.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.400]   So in Q4 of last year,
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.760]   El Nino spiked like crazy.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.200]   And that caused a lot of rainfall
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.920]   to hit the West Coast of Africa.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.040]   And as a result,
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.080]   this fungus was spread in cocoa trees.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.880]   There's a fungus called black pod disease.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.360]   And this fungus spreads when rainfall hits the ground
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.200]   and it splashes up,
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.400]   gets in the tree.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.920]   And then the tree has really bad yield
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.640]   and the cocoa production goes down.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.920]   So now if you look at the cocoa production out of Ghana,
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.040]   you can see that we've seen like 50% rough decline
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.080]   in cocoa production
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.640]   on the final bar chart.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.680]   So that's the effect.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.120]   So when that happened,
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.480]   basically everyone started to corner in the market.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.960]   So all the buyers of cocoa went in
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.040]   and started buying cocoa like crazy.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.960]   And then all the short sellers got squeezed
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.440]   'cause there's typically a pretty good balance
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.240]   on the short and long side in the market.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.600]   So then the short sellers got squeezed
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.000]   and it caused this big parabolic jump in price.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.560]   And that's where we're at today.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.080]   The chocolate companies,
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.360]   again, 11% of chocolate that you're buying at the store
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.480]   is made from this cocoa powder.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.880]   They're talking about cutting the size
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.840]   of their chocolate bars,
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.120]   raising prices,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.600]   and starting to use other ingredients.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.880]   So you'll start to see that happen in the shelves
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.400]   in the next couple of months.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.360]   But this is the big news
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.560]   in the commodity markets right now
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.160]   is this parabolic spike in cocoa prices.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.400]   And consumers will get hit with high prices
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.760]   and smaller chocolate bars.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.320]   - Isn't there a scene in trading places?
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.880]   - Yeah, the OJ futures.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.200]   - Yeah, OJ futures.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.800]   - That's right, they squeeze the orange market.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.640]   That's right.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.440]   That's basically what's happening in cocoa.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.720]   So there was a bad weather event,
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.440]   yields dropped by 50%.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.240]   So we got half the production.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.560]   And then all the traders came in
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.920]   and they squeezed the short side of the market
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.000]   and price spiked.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.640]   So that's kind of what's going on.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.280]   - If I had a dollar for the number of times
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.400]   a fungus has ruined a good time, man.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.000]   (laughing)
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   - Well, you know, it's interesting.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   I was looking at this and I was worried
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.440]   about chocolate prices.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.480]   - Wait, here it comes.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.000]   - I was really worried about chocolate prices,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.360]   specifically on Amazon right now
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.160]   and these edible anuses,
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.840]   your anus prices have gone up somehow.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.840]   So these chocolate, your anus prices are skyrocketing
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.320]   in real time.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.920]   - How did you find this?
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.040]   - I just typed in your anus,
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.680]   I typed in Freeberg's Uranus and chocolate
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.520]   and this came up.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.120]   It was the number one result.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.360]   So we know what...
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.320]   There it is, Uranus.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.840]   Chocolate prices are going up.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.440]   - I know what I'm getting you guys for Christmas this year.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.160]   - You noticed it was price in euros, not dollars.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.720]   - Yeah, it's not a valid winner.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.520]   - It was coming from Belgium.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.720]   I guess they got some serious kink going on over there.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.280]   - Yes, if you want a chocolate Uranus,
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   it's there for you.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.600]   But I just was like, Google search, chocolate Uranus.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.160]   And yeah, I don't recommend you make that search
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.040]   if you're listening to the pod.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.520]   - Well, when I heard there was a spike in Coke prices,
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.200]   it made me think of this.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.440]   (laughing)
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.080]   - Say hello to my little friend.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.760]   - I went to the last time...
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.280]   When's the last time you watched
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.600]   Scarface beginning to end?
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.440]   Not like just caught a couple of scenes.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.760]   - During COVID, I watched it, yeah.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.800]   - It holds up, yeah?
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.320]   - Yeah.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.720]   I mean, man, it is...
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.120]   By the way, I saw Dune 2.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.440]   Chamath, have you seen it?
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   - No, no, don't say anything
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.880]   'cause I need to wait till it comes to streaming.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.360]   Okay, I loved it.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.880]   - I'm going back to see it again.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.040]   I'm going to see it at IMAX this time.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:37.880]   - So you were with me?
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.760]   - I didn't hate it.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.160]   I just think it's overrated.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.000]   Like Spielberg said,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.680]   it was like one of the greatest moments of his life.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.080]   - It is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:44.920]   I thought...
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.400]   - No, it's completely overrated.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.520]   I'm not saying it's bad.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.960]   It's just not...
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.000]   - Scale of one to 10.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.920]   Give it a number.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.360]   - I will do anything to have this guy do Dune 3.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.960]   He's talking about whether or not he should do it.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.080]   He's like, I'm only going to do it
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.360]   if it's going to be better than Dune 2.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.080]   - You know, he's Canadian, Denis Villeneuve.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.360]   - Canadian guy, yeah.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.480]   - He did Sicario.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.680]   - Sicario and The Arrival.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.360]   Like he's honestly one of the top three directors of our time.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.840]   - Who's that, Villeneuve?
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.680]   - Denis Villeneuve?
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.440]   - No, Denis Villeneuve.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.280]   - Villeneuve.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.120]   - Villeneuve.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:12.960]   - Villeneuve.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.520]   - Villeneuve?
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.360]   - I don't know.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.640]   The hero in that movie is like the soy boy type.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.080]   I mean, I don't really believe that he's leading an army.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:21.920]   - Soy boy.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.720]   - That's not credible.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.760]   - You know the story I read a lot about,
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.000]   you know, these were all like short stories
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.600]   published in magazines by Frank Herbert.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.480]   - Serialized.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.320]   They were serialized.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.200]   - And he was really into drugs.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.920]   He was really into mushrooms.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.000]   And so the spice came around from the mushrooms.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.840]   - Makes sense.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.040]   - It was written in 1965.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.200]   There was this idea that we needed to move
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.560]   towards zero population growth
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.360]   'cause the population spike on Earth
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.960]   was gonna cause resource constraints
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.160]   and we were all gonna die, if you guys remember this.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.960]   And so there was this big movement.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.760]   It's what launched the hippie movement.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.440]   - Did they not have math back in 1965?
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.840]   - Yeah, they really did think this
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.120]   and that there wasn't gonna be improvements in productivity.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.280]   So there were limited resources.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.160]   The world was gonna run out of land.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.400]   And the ecology or the environmentalist movement
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.360]   kind of sprung out of this effort.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.080]   So a lot of what he wrote about was the ecology
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.040]   and the connection between the fungus and taking mushrooms
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.240]   and better understanding the world around you.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.800]   So, so much of this was rooted in a hippie movement, Sax,
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.880]   to your point, when he wrote these original short stories.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.320]   - Did they ever explain what the spice is in Dune?
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.560]   - No, and it was tied to mushrooms.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.840]   - They never explained why people want spice.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.280]   - When Frank Herbert was interviewed later,
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.960]   he talked about how it was meant to be about
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.320]   fungus is the greater of life and this greater of life.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.680]   And he wanted spice to be representative of mushrooms,
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.600]   of fungus, psilocybin.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.120]   And it was like, it opens your mind
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.960]   and you get more connected with nature and all this stuff.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.440]   So it was rooted in that,
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.120]   but they never really get into details on it in the book.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.600]   - So this film to you, Freeberg, is a 10 out of 10.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.920]   - Nine out of 10.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.680]   - Okay, I was gonna give it an eight and a half out of 10.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.600]   - I think the first half was slower.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.400]   I'd say like the second, I mean, like,
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.560]   Chamath, I'm not ruining anything.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.880]   - I really like Zendaya.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.120]   I think she's super cool.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560]   - I agree with you, Sax.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.600]   I'm not a huge Timothée Chalamet fan.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.440]   I think he's too skinny for me.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.280]   - Is it his name?
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.040]   Is it the name or is it the whole package?
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.080]   - No, I grew up in Canada with a lot of French people.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:16.920]   So I'm cool with that.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.160]   I don't like, he's just too skinny.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.440]   Like do a couple pushups or something.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.600]   - It's the vibes in general.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.680]   What do you give it, Sax?
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.880]   - I give it an eight and a half.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.720]   I won't give it a nine.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.560]   I'll give it an eight and a half.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560]   - What do you give it, Sax?
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.400]   Give it a number.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.640]   - I'll give it a six and a half.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.480]   - Six and a half.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.760]   Now, if it had a proper lead,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.480]   who was more than 120 pounds.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.320]   - Sax, who is a good-
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.160]   - What would you give it?
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.720]   - Yeah, who's a good lead for you, Sax,
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.840]   where you would have given it a nine?
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840]   Exactly the same.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.960]   Everything is the same.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.520]   - Jake Gyllenhaal? - Without a soy boy.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.560]   - Oh, Jake Gyllenhaal?
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.680]   Is that more of a Sax nine?
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.360]   - Like ultimate fighting body, Jake Gyllenhaal?
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.120]   - Yes, I mean, who, Tom Cruise?
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.400]   - Ryan Gosling?
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.840]   - Ryan Gosling. - Ryan Gosling.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.680]   - What do you think, Sax?
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.440]   What movie is a 10 out of 10 for you?
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.280]   - I don't know.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.240]   You need like a young Russell Crowe or something.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.080]   - Right.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:06.920]   - Don't you?
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.960]   - But have you seen the original "Dune"?
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.320]   That guy, if you think that this guy was-
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.840]   - Kyle MacLachlan.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.680]   - Oh my God, that guy.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.880]   - In a David Lynch movie.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.720]   - Yeah, the David Lynch movie.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.000]   - That was good, actually.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.200]   - Yeah, it was a little,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.840]   I mean, it was similarly, it was like a soft protagonist.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.440]   - What is a nine out of 10 for you, Sax?
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.880]   - Yeah, what's a 10 out of 10 for you, Sax?
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   - "Gladiator," "Goodfellas," "Casino," "Sicario."
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.840]   - "Casino" is incredible.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:32.680]   - "Sicario" too. - "Sicario" is incredible.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.920]   - Yeah, all those are good.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:34.760]   All those are good.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.120]   - Yeah, those are all great. - We have the same taste.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.480]   - I might give this a seven.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.960]   I mean, I gotta see it again.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.200]   Maybe I'll revise it up to a seven,
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.040]   but it's not more than a seven in my book.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.200]   - Isn't there like a "Sicario 3" coming out?
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.040]   - I hope so.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.720]   "Sicario 1" and "Sicario 2" are so rewatchable.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.920]   Those are like the ultimate rewatchable.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.640]   - "Sicario 1" was unbelievable.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.480]   - Unbelievable.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.880]   "Sicario 2" does it for me.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.520]   - That scene with Emily Blunt at the border
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.280]   where you hear the noise of like, what are those locusts?
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.120]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.280]   - You know, oh my God.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.920]   - No, no, when they're in traffic and the cars are parked.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.760]   - Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.960]   - Yeah, that scene is like, I'm gonna go over it again.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.840]   - That scene to me is like the Bane scene in "Dark Knight."
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.680]   - Yeah.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.000]   - And also when he's at the dinner table of the drug lord.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.840]   - Yeah.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.040]   - Intense. - Oh my God, that scene is.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:19.880]   - Intense.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.880]   - I think that film has probably the best cadence
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.200]   of any modern film.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.560]   Like the way he kept pacing that film
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.040]   did not turn off for one second.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.880]   You were hooked from beginning to end
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.720]   and you could watch it a million times.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.560]   - Beginning to end.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.120]   - It's like "Godfather" was also like that.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.840]   - The pacing in "Dune II" is terrible.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.480]   I mean, he spends all this time in the wilderness
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.320]   and then the.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.040]   (men shouting indistinctly)
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:40.880]   Oh, you haven't seen it yet?
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.700]   Then why are we talking about it?
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.540]   - No.
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:43.360]   - 'Cause we're trying to troll him.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.200]   - I'm waiting for it to come to streaming.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.120]   - We had this whole conversation last time.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.920]   - Does anyone else think that "Arrival"
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.600]   is like one of the best films of our generation?
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.040]   - No.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.240]   - I mean, it's good, but it's not.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.080]   - I think it's good.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:54.900]   - Great.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.160]   - It's like such a mind-blowing film.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.420]   - Oh, socks, you know, maybe like a young buff Matt Damon.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.480]   - No?
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.600]   Matt Damon, no?
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.920]   - I don't really see him in the role.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.560]   - Okay, how about, what's that guy's name?
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.480]   Adam Driver.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.160]   - Yeah.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:14.980]   - Young Adam Driver.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.000]   - Oh, yeah, Adam Driver would work, yeah.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:17.840]   - He could do it.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.680]   - He would, yeah.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.440]   - That's kind of like a Kyle MacLachlan type pick.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.280]   You know, he's a little.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.320]   - Little offbeat. - Little emo.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.560]   - Yeah.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.600]   - But not so skinny.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.680]   - Yeah, I mean, the idea that he's gonna win
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.560]   all these fights and he weighs 120 pounds wet
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.880]   out of the showers makes no sense, like.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.160]   - Yeah, Zendaya kicks his ass.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.640]   - Zendaya does?
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.840]   - Doesn't she kick his ass?
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.320]   - Basically, yeah, I mean, let's not give it a period.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.720]   No, that scene with, best opening scene of the film.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.880]   What do you got, Sax?
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.840]   What's your best, most intense scene?
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.720]   - Of any film, any opening scene?
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.960]   - Most intense.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.960]   I mean, the Joker bank heist scene is incredible.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.800]   - That's good.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.120]   - I can't even say what was in the shaft
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.480]   of "There Will Be Blood."
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.200]   - Absolutely, climbing out of there with a broken leg, ooh.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.720]   - Oh my God, that sets the tone.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.960]   That's who he is as a person.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.880]   That's everything.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   - That's your spirit animal.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.720]   - That's it, that's it.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.400]   - You're bitter and angry and you have a competition.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.920]   - I have a competition in me.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.520]   - I don't like to see others succeed.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.080]   I'm David Friedberg, I'd like to see the world burn.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.800]   - Strike, strike, strike.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.000]   - Actually, it's true.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.040]   - It's accurate, it's really accurate.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.600]   - It's your favorite movie.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.360]   - It's true, for a reason.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.560]   - Yeah, you admit it.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   - Own it, own it.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.400]   - Just own it.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.920]   - I drink your milkshake.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.080]   - Keep the lie alive.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.240]   - I do have a competition in me, yeah.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.480]   - It's funny, the only opening scene of a movie
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.320]   that I really remember is "Reservoir Dogs."
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.120]   You know, when you talk about an opening scene
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.200]   that's memorable.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.040]   - Pulp Fiction?
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.240]   - Well, no, what was the opening scene?
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.480]   Oh yeah, the opening scene in "Pulp Fiction"
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.240]   is pretty good too, where they're robbing the diner.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.760]   - Yeah, the diner, it's like you're hooked
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.400]   on the dialogue right at the beginning.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.240]   - Yeah.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.080]   Yeah, probably some Tarantino movie.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.200]   - There was nothing like that, right?
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.800]   When that came out, you're like, "What is this?"
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.640]   And then you're just like--
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.880]   - Actually, the opening scene of "Goodfellas"
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.760]   is really good, where the guy's kicking the trunk
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.240]   from the inside, they think he's dead.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.520]   - Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.360]   - Yeah.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.000]   - Saving private Ryan.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.320]   - Also, I'd say "Heat."
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.160]   - Pretty great.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.720]   - Jamal, if you wanna go see it at IMAX,
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.560]   I'll go with "Heat."
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.920]   - I'm not on that list, J.K.O.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.000]   - "Heat," amazing.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.840]   - Yeah.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.520]   - I mean, "Heat" is definitely top 10.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.880]   They're coming out with "Heat 2," by the way.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.480]   They wrote a book, and then that's coming out.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.200]   I can't wait for "Heat 2" and "Gladiator 2."
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.840]   Where do you go to see the IMAX?
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.920]   - Oh, they have a good one in the city in San Francisco.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.160]   - The Metreon, it's a 70 millimeter--
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.000]   - That's too close.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.600]   - It's a 70 millimeter IMAX.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.560]   - It's ginormous.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.040]   And they're doing the full print at that theater of "Dune 2."
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:53.000]   So it's like, he shot the thing in 70 millimeter IMAX.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:53.840]   - I saw it in a small IMAX.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840]   - Extremely expensive.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.040]   - Absurdly expensive.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:57.880]   - Absurdly.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.240]   He spent like $190 million on this film.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.080]   - It's fantastic.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.360]   Everybody go see "Dune 2."
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.920]   - Sax, what films do you have coming out?
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.840]   Anything interesting?
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.000]   - You're producing anything?
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.240]   - What's in the production line?
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.840]   - You bought the rights, right, to something?
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   - We released "Dollyland" earlier this year
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.760]   with Ben Kingsley playing Dolly.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.600]   - Yeah, congrats.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.320]   - And actually, Elon just posted a long reminiscence
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.120]   about how he made "Thank You for Smoking,"
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.200]   which was kind of cool.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.040]   Did you guys see that?
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:22.880]   - Nice.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.720]   - No, I didn't see it.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.560]   - No, I didn't either.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.680]   - Someone tweeted like, "Hey, did you know
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.680]   "that Elon Musk and Peter Thiel
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.920]   "and Max Levchin and David Sax produced this movie,
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.560]   "Thank You for Smoking?"
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.760]   'Cause it's been almost 20 years.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.920]   - I remember.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.760]   - People don't know about it.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.120]   So anyway, someone tweeted it and Elon responded.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.760]   There's a really crazy story behind it.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.840]   And they were like, "Oh, tell us."
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.600]   And he wrote up a long tweet explaining
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.680]   how he got the rights.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.360]   And his memory was actually really good.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.680]   I was impressed that he remembered
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.680]   all of these details from 20 years ago.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.440]   - Yeah.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.160]   And he tweeted back like, "Look, if Jason Reitman's
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.920]   "up for the sequel, let's do it."
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.880]   - (laughs) Reitman's doing pretty good.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:58.720]   He's doing okay.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.240]   All right, everybody, for the Rain Man, David Sax,
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.880]   Chamath Palihapiti, the German dictator,
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.920]   the sultan of science,
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.080]   I'm the world's greatest moderator, blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:10.920]   We'll see you.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.240]   Oh, and by the way, if you're listening to this,
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.280]   go ahead and check out "All In" podcast
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.160]   on YouTube and subscribe.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.360]   When we hit a million subscribers,
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.920]   which we're well on our way to, halfway there, I think,
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.320]   we're going to throw a million subscriber party.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.920]   And so, yeah, subscribe and you might get an invite.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.400]   And we're going to try to have as many people
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.160]   at the million subscriber party as possible.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.000]   When we hit, I think, 600,000,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.800]   we're going to do a live Q&A on the channel.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:41.320]   So really cool milestones coming up for the pod.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.400]   And we'll see you all next time.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.240]   Bye-bye.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.080]   - Bye-bye.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:45.920]   Love you, guys.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.760]   - And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.600]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.440]   - Love you, Wes.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.800]   - I'm the queen of quinoa.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.640]   ♪ I'm going all in ♪
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.840]   ♪ What, what, your winner's line ♪
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.480]   ♪ What, what, your winner's line ♪
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.800]   - Besties are gone.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.120]   (laughing)
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.240]   - That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.480]   (laughing)
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.960]   - We should all just get a room
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.560]   and just have one big huge orgy
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.760]   'cause they're all just useless.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.240]   It's like this like sexual tension
