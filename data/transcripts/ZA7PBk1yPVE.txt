[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.760]   Today we have an email from an anonymous listener.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.560]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.620]   All throughout the Bible we see angels speaking to believers.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.740]   They speak sometimes in person and often in dreams.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.460]   In that light, the worship pastor at my church recently mentioned to others that he had regular
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.980]   talks with one angel.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.980]   I don't see that dynamic so evident in scripture of ongoing conversations between believers
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.580]   and angels themselves.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.520]   It tends to be more of a monologue, mostly.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.160]   Someone else in my church suggested the worship pastor is likely speaking to a demon.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.600]   In APJ 1618, you address the ministry and purpose of angels today, but not how the angels
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.400]   interact with believers today.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.480]   Do they?
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.800]   Are angels involved in our daily lives to this degree?
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.800]   Should we expect to hear from an angel, and would it even be possible to have an ongoing
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.520]   dialogue with an angel himself?
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.400]   And could a believer claiming to talk with angels actually be talking to a demon?"
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.160]   Yes, it is possible that a person who claims to be talking to an angel may be talking to
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160]   a demon.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:28.360]   The reason I say that is because the apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 11.14, "Even
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.200]   Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.420]   In other words, it's part of Satan's very nature that he's deceptive and would love
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.360]   to distract the saints at best and delude them and destroy them at worst by drawing
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.120]   off their focus from Christ to angels.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.440]   It is also possible that a person who claims to be conversing with angels is simply conversing
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   with images or voices in his own head that are not in fact either demons or angels.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.400]   But my main concern with persons who claim to be conversing with an angel is not primarily
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.380]   that they are experiencing demons or hallucinations, but that they are being drawn away from Christ
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.820]   and his provision of all that we need in our communication with God and are getting help
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.520]   from God.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:40.980]   So let me give four reasons from Scriptures why I think pursuing conversations with angels
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.880]   is a mistake.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.940]   Number one, the Old Testament gives repeated warnings against turning away from the revelation
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:00.000]   of God revealed in Scripture through his appointed prophets to alternative means of communication
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.800]   with the supernatural.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:10.940]   For example, Deuteronomy 18.10, "There shall not be found among you anyone who practices
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:22.000]   divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens or is a sorcerer or a charmer or a medium
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.160]   or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.200]   abomination to the Lord."
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.800]   Now I know that angels are not listed in that group, but the question we should be asking
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:52.120]   is this, why is God so resistant to our seeking means of communication with the supernatural
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.840]   other than himself and his appointed means of discerning his will and his ways and his
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.800]   character through his Word, by his Spirit?
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.360]   The question is not simply whether that list in Deuteronomy is exhaustive.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.840]   The question is, why is it even there?
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.440]   And there seem to be at least two answers in the Old Testament context for why it's
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   there.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.960]   One, seeking to communicate with the supernatural in these ways puts us in the category of pagan
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.880]   nations who are constantly groping around for some medium by which they can find absolute
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.240]   truth so as to make life worth living.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.400]   This is considered an abomination by God because of how badly it reflects upon God and his
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.120]   having revealed himself to Israel in his appointed ways, which is the other reason why these
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.280]   mediums are considered an abomination.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.600]   They don't just put us in the category of pagan nations, but they give the impression
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.280]   that God's not real, or that he's begrudging in telling us what we need, or that he's
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.120]   insufficient in himself to provide the truth we need to live by.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.280]   So I would say that there is good indication in the Bible that we should be very, very
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:23.320]   cautious about seeking out ways of communicating with the supernatural that give the impression
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.880]   that God and his provision of Christ and prayer and his Word and Spirit are inadequate.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.080]   Here's number two.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.880]   I would point out that in all the epistles of the New Testament, which give us guidance
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.600]   for how the church is to live, there are no instances of ordinary Christians or apostles
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.160]   conversing with angels.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.280]   I know that doesn't amount to a prohibition, but it certainly does amount to a caution
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:05.240]   and to an indication that such conversations are not essential for maturity in Christ.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.760]   Indeed, they may be a sign of immaturity because it takes a certain measure of maturity to
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.240]   benefit fully from the beautiful paths of communication God has providedâ€”in his Word,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.040]   in prayer, by his Spirit.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.760]   Third, listen to Colossians 2, 18 and 19.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:36.040]   Let no one disqualify you insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:44.760]   about visions, puffed up without reason by a sensuous mind, not holding fast to the head
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.800]   from whom the whole body nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.880]   grows with the growth that is from God.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.640]   Now, I can imagine that one person might respond to this text and say, "Nobody's talking,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   Piper, about worshipping angels, just conversing with them."
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   Well, right.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.800]   I know that.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.420]   But here's the point of the text.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.080]   When people begin to crave visions and to communicate with angels, something has gone
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:23.060]   wrong with the way they are holding fast to the head, Jesus Christ, and his all-sufficiency
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.280]   in nourishing the body of Christ, holding the body of Christ together, growing the body
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.640]   of Christ.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:38.680]   Paul is concerned not simply with people who are worshipping angels, but they're replacing
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   Jesus as the head, esteeming angels more significant than the paths of nourishment and strength
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.360]   and help and encouragement that God has appointed through the head, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.840]   Now, the fourth pointer away from conversations with angels towards God simply builds on what
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:11.760]   I just said in number three, namely, that God has provided such a precious and sure
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:21.520]   and solid pathway to mercy and grace and help that it is an insult to him to act as though
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.240]   we need paths into the supernatural besides what he has taught in his Word.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:34.360]   And I'm thinking here especially of Hebrews 4, 15 and 16, which go like this.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.480]   "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   Son of God.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.280]   Let's hold fast to our confession, for we do not have a high priest who is unable to
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.960]   sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.360]   yet without sin.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.200]   Let us therefore," and that therefore means in view of this amazing high priest that we
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.340]   have, in view of his amazing capacities to sympathize with us, "therefore with confidence
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:15.040]   draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.680]   of need."
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   Now what the writer to the Hebrews is laboring to do here is help us feel the wonder and
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:33.240]   the solidity and the sufficiency of the way God has made mercy and grace available to
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:42.560]   us, namely, at the throne of grace, this God's throne, not angelic intermediaries.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.080]   Through the finished work of the great high priest, Jesus Christ, in prayer, by faith,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.640]   with the help of God's Spirit.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:10:01.620]   So for those reasons, I would strongly discourage anyone from seeking to communicate with angels,
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:10.340]   and I would regard the claim that one does such a thing to be a mark not of maturity
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:20.320]   but of immaturity in thinking that something more glorious, more satisfying, more amazing,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:28.560]   more helpful could be found through angel conversations than through the glory of God's
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.360]   Word and prayer by the Spirit in the fellowship of God's church.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   So good.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.180]   The word "the majesty of Christ" in the Word applies here and touches on several related
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.180]   topics too.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.300]   It helps explain why Scripture forbids conversations with angels, of course, but also why the Bible
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:55.940]   forbids seances and necromancy and the use of mediums and fortune tellers and palm readers,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.180]   not to mention why we don't need the next best-selling book from someone who claims
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.340]   to have died and gone to heaven before returning to earth to write a book to tell us all about
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.340]   it.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.540]   You can find out more on all of these themes, these sort of packaged themes represented
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.620]   in this episode today, episode 1744 is this episode.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:21.380]   You can also see in the archive APJs 302 and 1052, and you can find APJs 302 and 1052 in
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:29.020]   the APJ archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.220]   We have another missions-themed episode coming up on Wednesday looking at how our joy in
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.460]   delighting God relates to how we serve the nations with the gospel.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.540]   Super important connections here.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.780]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.500]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
