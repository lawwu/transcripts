[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.880]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.440]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.560]   all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.280]   on my journey to optimize and upgrade my own life.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.720]   Now, a good portion of the emails I get from you all
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.920]   are about how to best use all the points and miles
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.720]   you've racked up for travel.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.000]   And while I've covered parts of that
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600]   in at least a dozen episodes,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.400]   I felt like it's time to have an episode
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.480]   solely focused on booking or travel.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.900]   So for the last few months, I've been trying to track down
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.120]   someone who is truly world-class at this, and I did.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.440]   So today, I'm joined by Tiffany Funk,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.560]   who knows this game in and out.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.400]   For the past decade, she's produced, written for,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.040]   and been the managing editor of One Mile at a Time,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.600]   the largest independently-owned travel and loyalty blog,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   and she also ran operations
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.080]   at one of the top award-booking services,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.920]   Points Pros, for nine years.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.140]   Then, she took all that experience to co-found Point Me,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.360]   one of, if not the best award-searching product out there.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760]   So today, we're gonna break down the why, when, and how
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.320]   to search for award travel,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.400]   talk about some of the philosophy
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.280]   about how to think about travel
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.880]   with your points and with your miles.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.840]   We're gonna get tactical,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080]   so you can confidently put your points and miles to good use.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.120]   I'm also gonna try to get a few travel hacks
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.060]   and tips from Tiffany,
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.380]   because after visiting 80-plus countries,
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.080]   I'm sure she has plenty.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080]   So let's get started after this.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.760]   Tiffany, welcome to the show.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.000]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.760]   - Of course, thank you.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   - Before we actually talk about the process
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.680]   of booking award travel,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.560]   I just wanna talk about why people should even think
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.880]   about award flights.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.160]   I know I get a lot of people that always email me in
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.920]   and say, "Wouldn't it just be easier
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.320]   "if I just redeem all these points for cashback
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   "or book in the travel portal?"
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.660]   And I know you've thought about this more than anyone.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.400]   How do you think about that trade-off?
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.980]   - Yeah, that's actually really interesting,
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.660]   because my answer three years ago would've been different,
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.360]   and I actually think as we talk today,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.920]   there's going to be a lot of things where I will say,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.540]   "My answer three years ago would've been different,
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.700]   "but for right now, this."
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700]   In general, everyone has points, though,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.020]   and no one knows how to use them.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.000]   And I think there's an intimidation factor,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.240]   and people just think, "Okay, it's hard,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   "but the portal is easy."
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.600]   So I think it's worth knowing what the options are
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.120]   and how to explore your alternatives,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.880]   and just do that comparative shopping,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.580]   even if you do ultimately end up booking through the portal
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.460]   because the nonstop flight isn't available
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.840]   using a traditional miles and points award,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   or you decide that actually for this trip,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.080]   the economy is fine, and so the value is better
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   through the portal just because of the way
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.120]   the economics have changed in the past couple of years.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.320]   But ultimately, there is tremendous value to be had
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.960]   by leveraging these loyalty programs and their partners
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.040]   and what we refer to as distressed inventory.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.620]   The goal of an airline executive
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.960]   who works in loyalty management
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.720]   would be to take all 150 of those seats on a 737
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   and sell every single seat on the plane
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.880]   for the maximum amount
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.520]   that each passenger was willing to pay.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.600]   So that might be a $49 WebSaver special,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   it might be a 65,000 mile redemption,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.060]   but at the end of the day, if the seat goes out empty,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.000]   no one gets anything.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.680]   So because of that, there's this very complicated interaction
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.740]   between the airline, their alliance partners,
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.560]   other partners, where everyone is collaborating
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.960]   in the background to make these seats available
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   in different inventory buckets,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.360]   and that's where the magic of miles and points comes in
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.680]   because there's frequently opportunities to use points
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.400]   that you didn't even know you had or had access to,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.080]   but they're one of 25 partners that your credit card
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   or your hotel points can transfer to.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.800]   You can move them to that program,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.000]   you can get a seat on the same flight
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.240]   you were going to purchase otherwise,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.840]   and you're spending a fraction of the points
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   that you would have.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.880]   - Is there a kind of rule of thumb fraction
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.520]   where using points by transferring them to partners
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.560]   can be two to three times as valuable?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.720]   One of the scariest things is if you Google online,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.080]   you'll find someone who writes a post about,
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.620]   I got 25 cents per point booking this crazy thing.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.400]   I don't wanna set the bar there,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.520]   but is there a place where you're like,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.360]   look, even this feels like a win?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.200]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.820]   On average, over the time we've been doing this,
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.600]   I typically find that people who are transferring
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.440]   their points to a program and redeeming
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   through the loyalty program charts and those methods,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.920]   they're getting six to 12 times the value
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   of someone who redeemed through their credit card portal.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.680]   And I like to make that comparison
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.560]   because when people talk about the value
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.440]   they got for flights, it's frequently not reality-based.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.520]   - And what do you mean by that?
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.280]   - Because ultimately, and this gets into
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.000]   the economics classes that maybe it's been a while
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.960]   since anyone's taken, the ultimate value of a thing
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.440]   is only what you or a comparative consumer
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.160]   is willing to pay for it.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   So that flight from Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.800]   is only worth $25,000 if you were ready, willing,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   prepared, and able to purchase a $25,000 flight to Abu Dhabi
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.500]   and I don't have anyone in my life for whom that's true.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.640]   So you can't really say, okay, I traded in
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.160]   my 70,000 advantage miles for this $25,000 flight
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.200]   because those 70,000 points are not worth $25,000.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.280]   You would not have paid $25,000, right?
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.120]   What you would have paid might have been $4,000.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.660]   You know, if it was a special occasion or something,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.840]   even still, I don't know a lot of people
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.600]   who are buying $4,000 flights to Abu Dhabi.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.080]   So I like to base it off of what you would have paid
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.200]   booking through the credit card portal
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   because you would probably, if you were in
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.080]   the credit card portal, seen that price
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.520]   for that flight to Abu Dhabi and been like,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.920]   I'm not spending that many hundreds of thousands of points,
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.800]   but 70,000 points is a bargain.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.640]   - Yes.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.460]   - And sort of looking at it that way
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.960]   and framing it a little bit more practically.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.520]   - And are there types of travelers for whom
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.920]   that huge multiple is not as valuable,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.200]   whether it's people flying economy
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.120]   versus splurging for business,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.680]   only flying domestic, international?
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.900]   - So it used to be that the best value for your points
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.720]   was very consistently international premium cabins,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.240]   where you were going to get tremendous outsized value
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.920]   if you were booking, especially a partner,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.260]   and booking the front of the plane
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.520]   versus if you were trying to use your points domestically.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.160]   There's so many occasions where I'd see somebody be like,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.840]   oh, I booked tickets from Phoenix to Orlando
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.120]   and they were 50,000 per person each way,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.040]   but it was first class.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.800]   I'm like, oh my gosh, you're paying first class
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.840]   on a terrible, terrible product.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.940]   There's nothing first about a Dallas
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.000]   to Orlando experience regardless.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.560]   And 50,000 points per person,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.280]   that would have been enough for you to go to Europe.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   But I've tempered that a bit as I've matured in the space.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.360]   Some people just really want to go to Orlando
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   and so that's the best value of their points.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.660]   There's no value for them in Paris.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.500]   It is what it is.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.000]   And I don't wanna be disparaging of other people's
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.100]   travel plans and dreams and things like that.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.740]   The other thing is that the combination of dynamic pricing
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.800]   and the huge change in airline routing and capacity
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.320]   that we've seen since COVID began,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.840]   means that domestic awards
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.720]   can actually be a phenomenal value.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.400]   Your flights are very full, they're very limited.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.760]   And again, everyone is playing the same game
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.920]   of not having seats go out empty.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.960]   So there are frequently times
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.900]   where I've seen domestic flights
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.420]   where if you go to buy them last minute,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.580]   they're setting them at 450, $600 for an economy flight,
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.520]   but you can get them for 7,500 miles.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.640]   That's a great use of your points,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.840]   no matter how you slice it.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.760]   - And is that domestic economy or business?
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.520]   If domestic economy can be a good deal
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.440]   and international business could be a good deal,
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.700]   it seems like there's probably something good
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.860]   along the whole spectrum.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.780]   Is there any gap where you're like,
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.660]   "Whoa, if you're interested in this, not a good fit."
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.220]   - Yeah, so I generally would say
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.820]   that domestic first or business is still not a good deal,
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.900]   for the most part when using points.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.540]   And that has gotten worse since COVID
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.300]   because we don't have a lot of people
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.540]   traveling for business anymore.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.900]   So the cadence of inventory is different.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.480]   There's a lot of leisure travelers though,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.440]   and there's a lot of people
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.020]   who haven't traveled for a few years,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.580]   and so they're willing to just buy up
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.400]   and pay the extra $100 when they're booking their ticket
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.560]   to have domestic first.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.320]   And that sort of becomes the thing,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.420]   is the buy-up price might not be very high.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.820]   It might be 100 or $150,
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.380]   but the award price is probably at least double of economy.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   And maybe that's fine
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.200]   if you're going from 7,500 miles to 15,000 miles,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.760]   but if you're going from 25,000 miles to 50,000 miles,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.400]   that's just a huge premium for a recliner.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.100]   - First off, like you said, it's a recliner.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.820]   There are very few other than San Francisco, LA to New York,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.060]   very few of the routes domestically
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.620]   have a quality business class product.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.460]   Internationally, you said maybe it's 100, 200, $300 buy-up.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.660]   I kind of always had this mantra of like,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.140]   I'm never gonna pay for business class.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.980]   That'd be crazy.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.540]   I've had times where I've looked and it's like $100 more.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.020]   And it's like, wow, we have kids, we're traveling with bags.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.660]   The bag fee's $30.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.420]   - Exactly, just adding that up by itself.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.780]   It's like, okay, this actually makes sense.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.700]   - But internationally, whenever I look,
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.540]   it still seems to be like three to five times
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.540]   more expensive to buy a business class ticket
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.580]   than it does a coach ticket.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.500]   So that's where I think you can get another bulk of value.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.220]   Does anything change now pre-pandemic?
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.260]   It was me and my wife, just the two of us.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.580]   Now it's me and my wife, two kids and an au pair.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.940]   - So everything has changed.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.420]   - Everything has changed in more ways than one.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.980]   But when it comes to travel,
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.820]   if you're playing a game trying to look for five seats,
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.860]   I wanna get in, by the way,
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.980]   to the actual meat of this conversation,
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.380]   which is how do you do this?
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.820]   But someone emailed me the other day and said,
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.740]   well, we have four kids.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.620]   We're looking for flights with six of us.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.060]   Like what kind of expectations should someone like that have
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.300]   because I think looking for one seat
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.060]   is so much easier than looking for four,
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.300]   at least in my experience.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.420]   And if it's more than--
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.180]   - So many things are different when you're single
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.260]   than when you have a family.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.740]   And this is actually one of the things
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.420]   that has long bothered me about the miles and points space,
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.740]   and especially a lot of the influencers
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.500]   are pretty consistently younger people
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.700]   with not a lot of ties.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.020]   And they come from a pretty high socioeconomic status.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.940]   We're guilty of this.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.860]   Ben and I, at one mile at a time,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.220]   so much of when we were doing our things,
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.020]   we had partners, but we had a lot of flexibility.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.660]   We were both digital nomads.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.700]   So it's very easy to be like,
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.340]   yeah, Buenos Aires for the weekend, why not?
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.540]   Once you have other responsibilities
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.820]   and other people in your life, things change, right?
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.660]   So I'm very sensitive to people who have kids.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.620]   I will say in your case,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.100]   it's much easier when they're the size that they are
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.060]   and you don't have school schedules to contend with.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.860]   Once you get into school schedules,
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.180]   I think the expectation needs to be adjusted
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.580]   on the earning side of the equation.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.420]   For your listener who has the family of six now,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.180]   and if they know that they're going to be traveling
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.940]   over comparatively peak dates,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.700]   you're either going to be going over spring break
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.300]   and everyone in your area has spring break at the same time,
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.140]   or you're going to be going
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.380]   like when school gets out or things like that,
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.820]   like that's just the natural cadence of family travel.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.180]   You need to solve that ahead of time
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.460]   and earn more points either in a specific program
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.220]   or that can be transferred to a specific program
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.260]   from a variety of sources.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.580]   And we can talk about some of those
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.580]   because ultimately for a price,
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.940]   these airlines are willing to accommodate
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.620]   any lack of flexibility that you have.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.740]   You just need to prepare for that early
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.740]   and just know that like your awards might cost you more
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.100]   in terms of points, you could quantify,
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.900]   okay, what is the cost of a connection?
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.900]   What is the cost of mid-con red eye with toddlers, right?
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.500]   There's huge costs that aren't the points cost
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.340]   for doing that.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.900]   But if you can stack up a bunch of points
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.100]   in flexible programs, Capital One and Chase
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.940]   and even Built Now,
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.780]   and then transfer those points to Flying Blue,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.900]   like Flying Blue will absolutely have six seats for you
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.820]   from California to Europe during peak dates.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.180]   You're going to pay some fuel surcharges,
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.180]   but you can know that and you can plan for it
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.580]   and you can budget around it
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.020]   and you can still get a tremendous redemption.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.980]   It's just different than what a tremendous redemption
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.820]   might've looked like when you were unencumbered.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.180]   - We're looking at a trip in February
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.660]   to Belize, which it's so crazy because it's not that far.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.860]   It's like just a tiny bit further than Cancun,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.180]   but getting there is like 10 times more complicated
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.660]   because there's no direct flights.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.500]   So we were like, man,
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.760]   it's going to cost us like 70, 80, 90,000 miles to get there,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.820]   which in our mind seems crazy for such a short trip.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.560]   But the week that my daughter doesn't have preschool
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.140]   is the week that all the schools are out in February.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.980]   - Exactly.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.620]   - And the flights are like $1,500, $2,000.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.700]   If you don't want to fly to Dallas
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.820]   and sit at the airport for seven hours
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.020]   and then get in at 11 p.m. and leave at 5 a.m.,
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.900]   it's actually still a good value to use the points.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.440]   It's just a lot more points than it would have been
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.260]   if I was like, oh sure, I'll take the red eye on Wednesday
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.740]   and I'll hang out at an airport for five hours.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.780]   It's just a different calculus.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.540]   So my takeaway has been the value is still there.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.760]   It's just more points.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.460]   And now that it's more points because of the flexibility,
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.960]   the desire to not change planes as much or long layover,
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.420]   you just need more points.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.300]   - Right, but I will also say that there is a benefit
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.780]   in thinking outside of the box with family travel.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.100]   Any trip that you would take within North America,
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.300]   including upper or Central America and things like that,
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.260]   Belize is a perfect example, is going to be expensive
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.780]   because a lot of people think that it's close and it's easy.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.580]   If you were to look instead those same dates
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.900]   and look at going to Thailand,
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.060]   I would wager that your travel time is not much longer.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.800]   You would spend far fewer points.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.860]   You're still getting to beach.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.180]   You're getting vastly better food
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.460]   than anything Belize has to offer.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.380]   And you might be surprised, right?
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.220]   It might be something to think about.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.420]   And I know a lot of parents,
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.820]   especially newer parents are hesitant.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.900]   They're like, "Oh my gosh, it's a long flight."
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.820]   Okay, but is it?
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.100]   It's probably the same travel day.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.940]   I did this.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.980]   I'll actually send you some pictures, Chris,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.100]   'cause they're adorable.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.700]   We took my sister's family and her kids.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.340]   We went to Thailand for a couple of weeks over Christmas
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.340]   and all in, everything done,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.100]   we spent about $2,000 per person for 10 days,
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.280]   including the value of the points.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.620]   And granted, I had the points to spend
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.620]   and not everybody has points to do seven people
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.940]   in international first class.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.540]   Again, you can plan for that.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.380]   And it was great.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.420]   My nephew was seven at the time,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.800]   which is a very precarious age for travel
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.740]   because they can't sit still, right?
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.220]   And they're very busy, but he was great.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.860]   And he loved the flight.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.980]   He laid down in the bed.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.300]   It was fantastic.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.460]   We worked through the jet lag
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.000]   and we didn't have to spend 12 hours in DFW,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.140]   which we would have had to do
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.860]   and did the next year when they went to Costa Rica.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.980]   - In this case, the family has decided
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.980]   this is the family trip.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.980]   So there's a little bit less flexibility.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.180]   - Yeah, so you didn't get a vote.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.620]   That's the other thing about being a parent, right?
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.540]   Is your vote share diminishes tremendously as you.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.780]   - But we're gonna start planning more family trips
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.120]   for our extended family.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.660]   This is an extended family trip where we're like,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.020]   hey, this is the plan this year.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.900]   This is where we're going.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.260]   Let us know if you need help booking it.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.600]   But I think we can agree.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.300]   Getting your points and transferring them
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.980]   can be a lot of value.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.940]   There's almost 30 different airlines.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.460]   You can transfer to amongst
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.780]   all these flexible points programs.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.880]   I went this morning, I was like, okay,
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.180]   if you sum up Amex and Built and Chase
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.900]   and Capital One and Citi, there's 30 airlines.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.560]   And if you look and include their partners,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.860]   it's almost double that.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.660]   Where does someone start to think about this?
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.340]   And I know you guys have a product to do this.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.280]   So I wanna cover both with and without tools.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.580]   But if someone's like, all right,
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.160]   I've saved up the few hundred thousand points
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.500]   I need to take a family on a trip anywhere in the world.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.140]   But like, what do I do?
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.360]   The Amex probably has like more than a dozen places
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.940]   you could transfer those points to.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.900]   How do you think about that if you're someone new to this?
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.380]   Okay, so the very old school way.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.980]   So I would actually take it back a step
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.900]   and I would think about this before deciding
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.140]   whether I'm going to get an Amex card
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.100]   or a Chase card or whatever other card.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.780]   Because while they do have a lot of partners
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.680]   and there's a lot of leverage,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.300]   there are some unique situations
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.780]   where you can't get Amex points to United
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.780]   and you can't get Chase points to American Airlines.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.600]   And because of how airline inventory management
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.040]   has evolved in the past few years,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   there may be times where you do need points
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.020]   with that domestic carrier
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.920]   because they are making space available
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.360]   only to members of their program.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.000]   So if you were talking before we started recording,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.660]   you mentioned French Polynesia.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.000]   So if you know that you wanna go from San Francisco
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   to Papeete and the only carrier that has a points program
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.180]   that flies in nonstop is United,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.460]   that's a trip where I would probably look at paying cash
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.540]   for the flights because they can actually
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.100]   be pretty reasonable in comparison
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.940]   and because they are considered South Pacific,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.900]   the award prices are bonkers.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.400]   But if you know you're going to want to use miles,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.060]   you know you're going to need United miles in that case
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.460]   because they're not gonna make space available
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.660]   to their partners very, very rarely.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.860]   So you probably, in that case,
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.780]   wanna get the Chase card versus the Amex card.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.500]   So that's my setting the table for that.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.860]   Otherwise, what I like to do,
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.540]   if we're doing the old school way,
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.520]   I like to go to Wikipedia and look at the destination
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.900]   that you're going to and literally put in CDG
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.140]   for Charles de Gaulle Airport Wiki
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.540]   and go through and look and see like,
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.020]   who are the airlines that fly there
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.500]   and where do those airlines fly to?
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.860]   This is the most manual way possible that you can do it,
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.780]   but I think it's really helpful 'cause you can look at it
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.300]   and you can be like, oh, okay,
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.500]   I didn't know that Air France flew there
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.740]   from Salt Lake City or whatever.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.900]   I actually don't have the Wikipedia page open
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.740]   for the Paris Airport, so I hope that's still true.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.940]   But you can look at that and if you cross-reference that
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.940]   to then the list of partners for your credit card,
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.180]   you can see like, okay, does Air France fly in blue?
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.540]   Oh, they are a partner of my program.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.340]   Okay, so that's a good place to start.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.780]   That's sort of the baseline.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.660]   You could go from there.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.220]   When you get into the more advanced ways, it's like,
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.780]   okay, well, what other programs are partners of Air France
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.500]   and is there an arbitrage opportunity
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.780]   by moving my points to some other SkyTeam carrier
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.580]   or some non-Alliance carrier
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.540]   and looking at their award charts?
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.680]   And at this point in time,
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.060]   you should have 30 to 70 browser tabs open
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.380]   and that's how you know you're doing it right.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.700]   - I wanna go back to this example of maybe it's better
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.460]   to have points in the domestic program.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.140]   So I will say, I got lucky.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.660]   We were flying last minute and it was actually cheaper
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.660]   to book through Air Canada's aero plan
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.980]   for the flights to Papiete.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.260]   - Right, but you were booking last minute,
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.700]   which is not how most people plan their trips to Tahiti.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.540]   - Totally.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.780]   - That's sort of that give and take, right?
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.780]   If you were like, oh, maybe we can go to Tahiti
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.040]   or maybe we'll go to somewhere else.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.880]   - Yeah.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.000]   - Then that's fine, but.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.240]   - Are there programs in general where you're like,
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.100]   okay, Flying Blue, I think is a great example
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.220]   because they're a partner of most flexible point programs.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.580]   They have pretty reasonable award prices.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.260]   Is there a, okay, I wanna go on a common route.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.220]   I wanna go from New York to London.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.920]   There's probably a quick version of,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.420]   I would say like maybe it's check Air France,
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.140]   check United or Air Canada and check British Airways.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.820]   And like start there, maybe you find something great
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.460]   before you get to the 60 browser tabs.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.840]   - Well, you said if somebody was brand new
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.860]   and wanted to know, right?
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.340]   So like they don't necessarily know where to look.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.920]   So if you're going New York to London,
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.820]   I would look first at Virgin Atlantic.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.300]   And I would also look at the travel time
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.180]   for New York to London.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.300]   I've been on a New York London flight
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.200]   that ended up clocking in at three hours and 45 minutes.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.520]   I don't need business class for three hours and 45 minutes.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   That's something to consider too.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.380]   And Virgin Atlantic will frequently have nylon
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.860]   for like 10,000 points in economy.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.540]   And that's an incredible bargain.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.740]   It can be a four hour flight.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.140]   We think of like, oh, it's international.
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.400]   But when you're already in New York, it's not that far.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.900]   But again, I think if you were looking
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.100]   at the Heathrow Airport Wikipedia page,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.620]   you would have been like, oh, Virgin Atlantic
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.720]   and they're a partner of all of my credit cards.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.560]   I can look there.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.660]   So it's the same method.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.500]   You don't have to memorize these things.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.700]   - I just didn't know if you had like a,
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.620]   before you get to 60, here's three or four to start with
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.660]   to see if you find something good.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.980]   - I think it depends where you're going.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.620]   People always want me to say like,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.080]   well, this is the best program.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.620]   And this is the best partner, so we should go.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.540]   But it really depends.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.860]   And as we see this trend where loyalty programs
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.180]   are making more and more inventory available
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.460]   exclusively to members of their own program,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.020]   it's better to keep your points flexible
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.620]   than necessarily go all in on that one program.
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.460]   Because what if you can't book something
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.900]   with their partners that you would have expected
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.740]   to be able to book?
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   Like back in the day where we moved maybe a billion points
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.380]   from membership rewards to AeroPlan
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.060]   to book Lufthansa First Class when it was a 16 seat cabin
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.580]   with no fuel surcharges through AeroPlan.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.660]   And like, it didn't even matter.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.100]   Frequently I would tell people, no problem, there's space.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.580]   And then I would go and actually look
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.420]   to see if there was space.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.260]   Because there was always space.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.860]   There were 16 seats in the First Class cabin.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:27.820]   Of course there was space.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.600]   - And to be clear, these were client points.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.580]   You didn't actually have a billion points yourself.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.320]   - Correct, these are other people's key points.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.700]   Yeah, and so things evolve and they change.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.220]   One of the great evolutions in the miles and points space
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.380]   in the recent comparative years
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.820]   from when I've been in the game
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.660]   has been the advent of these flexible points.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.660]   So you don't have to commit to a single program early on.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.980]   - It's funny, I always use the United card as the example.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.620]   People are like, oh, I live in the Bay Area
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.940]   so I have this United card.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.140]   And I'm like, well, even just a chase card
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.620]   might actually earn you more United points
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.260]   than the United card itself.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.840]   And then those points actually could go
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.500]   to a bunch of other airlines
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.940]   and you don't have to decide until you're planning the trip.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.500]   - Exactly, if you live in the Bay Area,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.540]   you should have the United card
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.900]   and you should not spend on it
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.540]   unless you are purchasing tickets on United.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.140]   You need the baggage benefit because you're flying economy.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.340]   In that case, it makes sense
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.120]   because getting triple points from another card
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.780]   doesn't offset the $150 that you would pay in baggage fees.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.620]   But yeah, don't use it at the grocery store, please.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.820]   - Or maybe even for buying United flights.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.380]   - Does United still have that limitation
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.700]   where you only get the baggage benefit on your credit card
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.180]   if you purchased the flight using a United credit card?
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.860]   - That is a question I don't know the answer to.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.540]   - Yeah, I don't know it off the top of my head anymore,
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.600]   but it used to be the case.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.460]   And so that was then my exception of like,
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.200]   this is the time when you would use that United card.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.160]   Otherwise, for the Delta and American cards,
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.260]   have them if you check bags, but don't use them.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.540]   - It's funny, I used to be in the like,
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.880]   why would you ever check bags camp?
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.580]   And it's like, oh, because maybe you have children.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.220]   - Now you have kids, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.340]   - Hi again, it's Chris's wife, Amy.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.100]   Do I need to keep saying that?
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.480]   Anyway, Thanksgiving is always a time
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.780]   where I reflect on the things I'm grateful for
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.820]   and think about ways I can give to others,
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.380]   which is why I'm so excited
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.260]   to partner with Daffy for this episode.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.180]   Daffy is a not-for-profit community
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.060]   built around a new modern way to give,
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.420]   and they're on a mission to help people
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.860]   be more generous more often.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.820]   I love Daffy, and we do all of our giving through their app
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.360]   because they make it so easy
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.860]   to make tax-deductible contributions
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.300]   and donate to any of the more
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.820]   than 1.5 million nonprofits in the US.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.740]   One of the nonprofits I've supported this year is Xero,
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.500]   the end of prostate cancer,
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.060]   which is an important cause for me
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.740]   because of the impact it's had on my family.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.000]   And giving to their organization from the Daffy app
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.300]   is so fast and so easy.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.820]   So go to allthehacks.com/daffy to start giving today.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.300]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.060]   you can get a free $25
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.340]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.340]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.700]   - So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.300]   which is actually true almost every day,
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.660]   and that's thanks to Viore,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.540]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.740]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.600]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.980]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all,
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.740]   and it's so freaking comfortable,
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.540]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.740]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.620]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.860]   unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.640]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.440]   And it's not just for men.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.260]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.900]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.360]   I think I have three pairs,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.420]   and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.500]   I've ever owned.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.380]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.820]   whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.320]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.240]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.300]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.780]   in your happiness, and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.580]   they are offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.420]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.620]   So, you should definitely check them out
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.780]   at allthehacks.com/viore,
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.620]   or in the link in the show notes.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i,
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.900]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.340]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.820]   - You mentioned the flexibility was probably the reason
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.200]   I found such a good deal.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.380]   If someone's thinking right now,
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.780]   "Oh, I wanna take a trip,"
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.380]   do they wanna start looking right at one year out?
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.260]   Is there a sweet spot that you've seen
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.280]   of when someone should start actually looking
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.620]   for a trip they're planning,
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.660]   if they know long enough in advance
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.540]   that they could search any time?
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.740]   - If you know that you're traveling someplace
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.740]   a year from now, look and book right now.
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.820]   You can always cancel it.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.580]   You can always change it.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.180]   Award tickets are super flexible.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.380]   There's frequently not even a penalty.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.260]   It depends on the program, of course.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.640]   But it's so easy to change or cancel them,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.520]   and you're not going to necessarily find something better.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.160]   It used to be that within 10 days of departure,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.780]   we'd see a lot more award space.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.980]   Again, the goal is for seats to not go out empty.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.980]   But with COVID and the social commitment
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.740]   to not having non-vaccine precautions,
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.700]   the reality of that is flight attendants
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.020]   and pilots are getting sick, and they're not at work.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:33.020]   And so if you are managing operations for an airline,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.860]   you used to comfortably be able to say,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.020]   "Okay, 10 days out, this is probably
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.860]   "what our flight loads are going to look like.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.060]   "These are the seats that are going to have occupants."
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.400]   And then we feel good about it.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.520]   And inventory management could say,
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.660]   "Great, we're gonna release these seats into inventory.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.860]   "We'll let partners book them.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.980]   "Maybe we'll have a last-minute sale."
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.900]   There was some degrees of confidence.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.160]   Now, we're seeing that inventory get held
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.740]   until sometimes two hours before departure,
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.560]   because on any given day, if you have one flight
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.080]   get canceled between San Francisco and Minneapolis,
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.740]   you now have 150 passengers
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:04.780]   that you have to do something with.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.300]   So if you don't have a crew,
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.460]   you have to accommodate those passengers.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.580]   And so we're just not seeing
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.420]   the near-term inventory dumps that we used to see.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.340]   That could get better.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.820]   So if you're booking a year out, you might get lucky.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.500]   And within 10 days or three days,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.380]   you might see a better itinerary.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.500]   You might see a nonstop.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.060]   You might see a nicer product.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.620]   And you can change to that.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.080]   But in the current environment,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.340]   if you see something, I would book it.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.300]   - Okay.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   What about flexibility with where you go?
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.940]   This is a question that I know you've gotten
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.780]   and I've gotten a lot.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.640]   It's like, "I just wanna take a trip
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.960]   "that lets me get a great use of my miles
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.940]   "and go somewhere in Asia next year."
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.580]   And I know from using basically
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.020]   any search tool on the internet,
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.620]   Google Flights is probably the closest,
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.580]   but it certainly doesn't have
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.600]   any miles and points component.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.540]   But just to be like, "Okay, from San Francisco in July
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.740]   "or next year, where could I go that's cheap?"
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.580]   Is there a points and miles equivalent?
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.440]   Or what do you tell people
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.580]   that have a little bit more flexibility
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.940]   but don't wanna run 1,000 searches?
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.940]   - In general, I think that the best use of points
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.980]   is always going to be something
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.660]   that provides you with a great experience.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.820]   But when you're very flexible with destinations,
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.500]   I actually don't think starting with Google Flights
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.620]   is a bad option.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.540]   Just to sort of see what the routings look like
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.400]   and the timings and to sort of get a sense
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.220]   of what the carriers are that are operating those routes.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.340]   As long as you know that that doesn't match over
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.620]   to award availability or even award routing rules.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.300]   There are things that you can do with miles
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.700]   that you can't do with money and vice versa.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.720]   - Can you give us some examples?
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.580]   - There's a lot of nuance to fair combinability.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.460]   So if you're in California and you wanna go to Sydney,
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.240]   obviously there's the direct flights
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.980]   that are going to be expensive.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.980]   Qantas or American or Delta or United
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.020]   now has nice seats going to Australia.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.660]   But you could also route via the Middle East.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.660]   And you could do something like from California
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.940]   into Doha and fly Qatar's Q Suites
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.180]   and then go first class from Doha to Sydney.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.740]   And you can't really book that with money
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.220]   because it's not a legal routing when using money.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.020]   Qatar might sell it to you as part of a round trip,
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.980]   but then there's different partners and things like that.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.460]   But if you call Advantage and you say,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.100]   okay, I need to book two awards, but I want them
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.560]   on one ticket, they can book that for you.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.140]   And it's business class in Q Suites on the long haul.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.660]   So you get that nice flat bed.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.740]   If you're traveling with a family,
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.620]   there's a suite that can basically be for four.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.480]   It's a lovely experience.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.260]   You can go to the museum and enjoy Doha
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.460]   and then go on to Sydney and it's like 100,000 miles.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.340]   And that's a great value.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.800]   It's a really extended trip.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.460]   It's a fun routing that you wouldn't necessarily do.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.620]   And it's frequently fewer points
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.420]   than doing like an LA-Sydney direct.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   Because carriers charge a premium for that
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.700]   in both miles and money
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.420]   because they know that that's what people want to do.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.940]   - So you can be flexible with routing
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.460]   and sometimes points and miles lets you do that.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.100]   What about just destinations?
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.780]   Like if someone said, I kind of want to go to Asia
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.740]   or I kind of want to go to Europe,
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.180]   I'm not sure where I want to go.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.640]   Is there an argument to be made of just like searching
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.940]   the major hubs to try to find something there first
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.900]   to see where it might be easiest to get to or?
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   - Yeah, no, I think that's a perfect example.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.500]   In general, it still makes sense to search hub to hub
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.300]   and just to get a concept of things.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.140]   Let's talk about Europe
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.740]   because Asia is very complicated with COVID still.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.940]   But we can go back to Asia.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.020]   The thing that I think we don't think about
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.960]   because travel within the US is really unpleasant.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.620]   Travel within Europe isn't necessarily unpleasant
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.140]   and there are a lot of low cost carriers,
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.000]   there's a lot of trains,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.940]   there's a lot of ways to get around.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.420]   So if you really want to go to Amalfi,
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.940]   you don't need to look at tickets to Naples.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.940]   You can look at tickets to Munich
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.700]   and then there's a bajillion ways per day
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.420]   to get from Munich to Naples that you can't use points for,
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.940]   but it might be like a $45 ticket.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   So I think looking at a major hub in Europe
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.860]   as a starting point that you wouldn't mind
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.380]   spending a night in if you needed to or a day
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.360]   is a great place to get started with that.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.580]   For people starting in the US,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.340]   I think it's important to recognize
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.300]   that the closer you get to the ocean you're going to cross,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.460]   the more flight options you will have.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.300]   So if you're in Miami and you're trying to go to Tokyo,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.260]   good luck, you're not going to find seats.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.020]   There is a Korean Air flight,
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.660]   or there used to be from Miami to Seoul,
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.660]   which would have been a good option,
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.380]   but realistically you're connecting in California
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.200]   or at least in Chicago or possibly in Texas.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.340]   And the same thing goes the other direction.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.820]   If you're in California and you want to go to Europe,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.560]   you could luck out and get a nonstop flight
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   in business class at a good price point at the saver level.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.320]   Or you might need to pay a few more points
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.140]   to have expanded availability.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.060]   And you could plan for that.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.320]   Or you might need to make a connection.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.780]   And that's where it gets into that sort of trade off
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.380]   of like, okay, if you're flexible and totally flexible,
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.260]   you still benefit from determining
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.140]   what is most important to you.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.740]   Is it the in-flight experience?
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.060]   Is it the travel time?
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.740]   Is it where you connect?
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.660]   Because overnighting in Frankfurt is not as fun
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.700]   as overnighting in Munich.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.580]   Everybody has their own things of what matters to them.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.740]   And the airports that they like to transit through and not.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.060]   And I think if you consider all of that
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.020]   as part of your flexibility,
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.040]   it makes it a little bit easier to narrow down
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.060]   your travel plans and your flight options.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.580]   - And one thing we talked about before we got started
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.100]   was the flexibility of dates.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.900]   People are like, oh, I want to go next year.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.340]   One thing you pointed out that I was like, okay,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.100]   well, are you really that flexible?
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.620]   I was kind of thinking about it for myself.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.780]   I was like, well, I might be flexible
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.040]   to go somewhere next year.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.020]   Maybe I actually really only want to go
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.780]   on Saturday to Saturday or something
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.860]   so that we're not taking more than one week
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.500]   off of work or school or something.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.340]   It's like, well, now you just narrowed 365 days
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.900]   down to like a hundred.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.000]   And you pointed out like, what about weather?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.340]   - Right, there are places that are super muggy in the summer.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.500]   And I love Japan as an example because everyone is like,
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.340]   oh, I'll go anytime.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.120]   Like, but you don't actually want to be in Tokyo in July.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.660]   It's very hot.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.180]   They turn the escalators off.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.860]   You could still go and have a great experience,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.980]   but like, it wouldn't be my preferred time.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.980]   - What are the local holidays when you're going?
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.820]   If you're like, oh, okay,
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.940]   I'm going to try and time it for cherry blossom season,
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.260]   but do you want to be there during golden week?
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.300]   Pros and cons to that.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.780]   That should be a conscious decision.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.360]   There's also a bit of just the human psychology of it
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.580]   where we all have this fear of missing out.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.660]   And in decade plus of doing this,
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.680]   I think every single time,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.780]   and I could check with my colleagues,
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.420]   but I'm pretty confident saying every time
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.180]   that we've had someone say, I'm totally flexible.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.780]   If I give you an itinerary,
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.620]   your natural instinct is going to be like, okay,
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.960]   but what about this instead?
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.800]   What about this alternative?
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.380]   So you aren't actually totally flexible.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.500]   You do have opinions.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.140]   You do have priorities and things that you want to consider.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.440]   So when you're booking for yourself,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.940]   I think just going through that triage list
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.460]   and thinking about what are school schedules?
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.620]   What am I willing to accommodate?
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.380]   Do I want to have a night in a cool city
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.920]   on the way to my destination?
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.820]   Or do I want to just have a shorter layover
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.240]   and just plug through?
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.620]   Am I checking bags?
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.560]   If so, am I concerned about if my bags get lost?
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.700]   One of my colleagues, their daughter and her husband
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.780]   were doing this hiking backpacking trip
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.780]   in rural Scotland last summer.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.580]   And they did almost everything right in their planning,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.900]   except they didn't plan enough time in Edinburgh
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.020]   at the start of the trip in case things go wrong.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.140]   And so when inevitably with the Heathrow baggage meltdown
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.680]   of last summer, their bag was delayed.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.480]   They're like, we're in Edinburgh and we have nothing.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.340]   We have just the essentials that we need in our carry-on,
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.620]   but we obviously didn't carry on our tent, right?
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.060]   So you need to think about that too.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   With the type of trip that you're taking,
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.340]   that may matter or it may not be an impact at all.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.940]   If you're planning on spending a week in Paris
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.040]   with your kids, having a lost checked bag
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.880]   is not a big deal.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.700]   You're in Paris.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.860]   You just go to Carrefour and buy whatever you need to buy
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.060]   and get it reimbursed through your credit cards,
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.620]   trip delay and coverage and move on with your life.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.020]   - The other thing I've just been thinking about is,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.660]   okay, even if I was like Japan flexible next year,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.340]   there's probably an ideal month
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.180]   or an ideal period of time.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.940]   And I don't know if you have any stats on this,
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.460]   but I imagine if you're like,
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.700]   I wanna go to almost anywhere
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.480]   and you're flexible within a month,
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.020]   you're probably pretty likely to find something
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.660]   that I don't even know if you need a year's worth
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.500]   of flexibility to find a good deal.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.860]   - No, no one needs a year's worth of flexibility
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   is my general sentiment there.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.780]   Other than that year's worth of flexibility
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.180]   helps you rule times out.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   So like I personally have done it a couple of times
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.180]   and will probably in future avoid traveling to Asia
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.300]   during Lunar New Year.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.380]   It's a really fun experience in ways if you haven't done it,
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.340]   but I think for most people,
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.780]   if you're not actively setting out to do that,
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.540]   it's just frustrating, it's too crowded.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.140]   All the places you wanna go, everyone else also wants to go
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.860]   and a lot of things are closed.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.940]   In Vietnam, they don't refill the ATMs during the holiday.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.020]   So there's just like one very specific difficulty
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.300]   for traveling during that time period.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.860]   So there's things like that that you can rule out.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.500]   But in general, I would say there's always a word space
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.420]   and I don't wanna say that
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.340]   that means there's always good award space
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   or there's always this thing that you saw on Instagram
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.820]   that you're going to be able to book,
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.500]   but there's always something
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:22.060]   and finding something that is good for you
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.260]   has a lot of nuance.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.200]   - Are there a few either routes or destinations
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.460]   that if someone's truly like,
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.400]   I just wanna go on an amazing trip with my points
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.780]   that you see more frequently than not
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.900]   popping up with better availability
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.660]   that could inspire someone and save them some points?
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.980]   - I would generally say, if you're going further,
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.940]   you're going to have better availability.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.460]   Like domestically, North America, even South America,
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.000]   flights are so full that there are just not
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.300]   the point bargains that people might want.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.100]   And so I do think that if you're looking for
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.780]   some kind of like aspirational fun trip,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.940]   it makes more sense to go further afield.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.540]   You also have the benefit of when you're going further
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.300]   of getting those international products
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.700]   that are much nicer.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.860]   Qatar has their Qsuites product
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.020]   and availability is pretty good,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.160]   not necessarily from all cities.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.360]   Like it's not great from LA right now
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.480]   because it's very popular,
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.060]   but they also have it to Seattle.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.260]   So if you're willing to do like that short hop up
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.340]   and then connect,
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.000]   then that opens up all of Africa and the Middle East
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.820]   and Southeast Asia to some really phenomenal options.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.900]   I think if you're doing that,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.900]   I also like to look at places where hotels are reasonable.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.940]   A lot of people have like the pinnacle of their trip
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.340]   as being like, I'm going to use my points.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.900]   I'm going to fly business class or first class.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.180]   I'm going to go to the Maldives.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.180]   And that's great.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.780]   I personally don't love the Maldives,
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.300]   which I know is sacrilegious,
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.220]   but it's just a difference in what I'm looking for
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.320]   in travel at this point in my life.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.440]   But I think that there's things like that
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.280]   that you can look at.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.620]   Like we took my niece to Egypt when she graduated
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.220]   from high school as like her senior trip.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.380]   And that's not something that she would have picked
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.620]   or that she would have thought of,
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.900]   but it was very much like, okay,
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.380]   well, we're going to go during this time, what's available.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.300]   Okay, there's easy space to Europe.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.700]   And then we can connect down to Cairo and then to Luxor.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.900]   And I don't think she would even put Egypt on her radar
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.220]   as somewhere to go, right?
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.900]   And it's not like it's that exotic
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.520]   in the space of exotic travel,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.740]   but it's very exotic if you're 17 from a smaller town.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.620]   - How did you come to the conclusion
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.280]   that that was a place that was easy to get to?
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.500]   Was that just trial and error or?
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.980]   - In general, Northern Africa is not difficult to get to.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.100]   - Meaning availability.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.360]   - And just their flight routings.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.340]   And I think one of the reasons for that
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.300]   is it's well served by both European carriers
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.740]   and Middle Eastern carriers.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.420]   And so you have that sort of combination
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.900]   of inventory and space.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.460]   Because you can fly to Abu Dhabi or to Dubai or to Doha
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.700]   and then connect up,
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.780]   or you can fly to Paris and connect down.
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   So it's just, you have more flights there
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.760]   than you would think.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.820]   It's also less competitive
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.660]   because it's not a place that as many people think to go to
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.020]   as like Florence.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.700]   I feel like the entire internet went to Italy this summer.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.060]   I don't know about you,
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.740]   but I feel like every time I opened Instagram,
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.260]   it's like, okay, you're in Italy and you're in Italy
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.220]   and you're in Italy.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.420]   So like a word space to Italy is very bad
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.500]   because people are just buying tickets to go to Italy.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.100]   Not as much travel to some of these other destinations.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.620]   Also my bias is that I tend to like to go places
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.500]   that people don't think to go.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.080]   That's just sort of where I'm at with travel
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.920]   at this point in time.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.740]   Like once you get to the close to 100 country mark,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.860]   I think you start looking for different things
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.700]   than you did in the first tranche of countries
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.840]   and destinations.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.180]   - You mentioned hotels,
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.580]   making sure that you don't get this amazing redemption
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.540]   to a place like the Maldives and then find out,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.140]   okay, now I have to spend thousands of dollars a night.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.860]   - Literally thousands of dollars.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.100]   Yeah, even if you're using points,
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.780]   you still have to pay for that seaplane.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.260]   - But how do you feel about points
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.580]   used on airlines versus hotels?
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.860]   My advice has often been,
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.600]   if you have points in a hotel program,
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.900]   by all means it can be great.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.100]   But if you have flexible points, other than Hyatt,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.260]   on the luxury side, at least it can be tough.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.060]   I have heard a lot of people point out,
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.380]   no, no, no, there are some really good sweet spots
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.340]   in Wyndham and Choice Hotels and IHG.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.940]   But I'm curious, you live and breathe this space.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.940]   How do you feel about using your transferable points
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.780]   at hotels?
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.460]   - I struggle, I struggle.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.580]   I think I struggle for a different reason
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.700]   than maybe some other people struggle.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.400]   'Cause it's not that there aren't values,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.940]   it's that my brain is full.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.740]   And at some point in time it's like,
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.100]   okay, I recognize that there's this great value
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.820]   for choice points if I move it here
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.900]   and move it here and move it here,
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.540]   but I don't actually want to stay there.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.420]   That's a factor too.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.480]   And the min-maxing of points
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.860]   to have a completely free trip is super fun.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.820]   It's super rewarding.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.300]   And also something that I don't think
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.500]   that most people have time for in their lives.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.340]   So I generally have taken an approach where,
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.960]   okay, here's a great points redemption for hotels.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.100]   It's a fifth night free situation
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.020]   with a Hilton or a Marriott.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.660]   Or it is one of these really niche properties
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.460]   where it's just ridiculous that you're able
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.980]   to use choice points to stay there,
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.340]   but it's this incredible castle, great.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.460]   And if I found that and locked in availability there,
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.260]   then maybe I find myself being more flexible
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.820]   with my flights and not trying to have
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.820]   the ideal redemption for flights
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.980]   because I already have this great hotel redemption.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.980]   And I sort of ladder it personally.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.340]   The flip side being, of course,
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.220]   okay, we found these incredible flights.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.680]   I took my mom on a trip once.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.220]   It was literally just an airplane ride trip.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.720]   We did Emirates, A380s the whole way through.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.500]   And it was like, okay, these are the dates
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.900]   that we're going to be in Dubai.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.540]   Or you know what, mom, let's go to Abu Dhabi
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.220]   and we'll stay at the Park Hyatt there in Abu Dhabi.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.220]   That's fine.
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.020]   But then we're going to have a couple nights in Singapore
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   and I'm not trying to get everything perfect.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.460]   It's like, well, this is where I want to stay with my mom
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.860]   because I know that she'll enjoy this.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.900]   And I can use some points
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.540]   or I can just book it through the travel portal.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.640]   And it's still a really good value, all things considered.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.740]   And the experience outweighs the value
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.660]   in those cases a little bit.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.420]   - There's only so many airlines that fly to a place
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.460]   and almost all of them, not all,
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.880]   but almost all of them have some type of program
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.980]   that you might be able to book
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.260]   directly or through a partner.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.780]   Whereas hotels, there are so many hotels
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.140]   that you can't book with points.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.540]   And similarly to you, I find myself prioritizing the flights
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.300]   just so that I have the mental freedom to be like,
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.100]   where do we actually want to stay?
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.100]   - And that's, I think, sort of just a great way of saying it
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.500]   in that sort of mindset of,
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.800]   I got a phenomenal deal on the flights
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.980]   and I didn't spend $25,000 for my family of four
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.260]   on these flights and we're still having
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.880]   this incredible experience.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.820]   And I wouldn't have spent $25,000 on the flights,
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.300]   but I would have spent 6,000.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.460]   And do I consider I need to save the 6,000
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.780]   or do I invest that back into this vacation
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.260]   and the experience that we're going to have
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.580]   and go ahead and book the suite
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.020]   rather than having to try and worry about
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.620]   finding the one property in Paris
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.380]   that will allow you to have connecting rooms?
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.020]   That's about to be your life.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:02.860]   - No, no, I know.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.220]   But I did see that I think Hyatt in Europe
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.340]   has a pretty good deal where at a bunch of properties,
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.820]   you can get your second room as a family
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.540]   at like 50% off or something.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.180]   Which is so necessary because those hotel room occupancies
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.500]   are frequently two people in a lot of places in Europe.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.140]   It's the fire codes.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.580]   You can't even find room for three
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.820]   even if the third is an infant.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.260]   So finding things like that that accommodate
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.860]   the way you need to travel in your life
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.140]   is I think ultimately the best travel hack.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.980]   - I found, and people have heard this before,
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.260]   this isn't just because you're here,
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.660]   you're not paying me to be here,
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.140]   but like Point Me was this tool
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.060]   and I remember when it came out as Juicy Miles
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.940]   and I was like, I hope one day they change the name of this
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.980]   and thank you.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.820]   - You're welcome.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.260]   That's ultimately my contribution to all of this.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.100]   It's not actually the decades of knowledge
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.820]   or like my ability to deconstruct things
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.740]   and then reconstruct them.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.500]   It's that we got to change the name guys.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.340]   - Yeah.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.180]   (laughing)
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.820]   But I'm so fascinated because it seemed like
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.180]   so many people tried to do this
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.420]   and it just stopped working.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.460]   Airlines hate it.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.900]   First off, why do airlines make it so hard
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.660]   for people to use their points?
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.380]   And how are you able to make it so much easier?
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.220]   - I don't think airlines make it intentionally difficult
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.180]   to use their points.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.580]   It depends on the program.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.700]   We have a lot of loyalty program managers
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.180]   that have been playing on easy mode recently.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.660]   We're about to see this in a lot of aspects of the economy.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.500]   When we had the last recession,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.260]   loyalty programs had to get really innovative
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.620]   and they had to get really creative
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.460]   because ultimately the job of a loyalty program
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.980]   is to fill seats on planes or fill hotel rooms.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.820]   It's to avoid perishable inventories.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.220]   That's why you have a loyalty program.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.620]   And we saw 15 years ago,
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.820]   really a lot of creative promotions
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.380]   and really interesting engagement
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.460]   and really honing in on who the customer was
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.220]   and how to leverage their interests and emotions
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.380]   in order to get seats filled on planes.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.260]   That hasn't been a challenge recently,
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.900]   the past couple of years not withstanding,
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.100]   but the latter half of this decade,
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.180]   everybody's on easy mode.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.700]   We saw a lot of loyalty programs go to,
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.140]   we're basically running a coupon program.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.300]   It's buy nine, get one free,
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.100]   just like at your local coffee shop.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.980]   And that's as innovative as they were getting
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.100]   because people had a lot of money to spend on flights
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.420]   and so it wasn't as much of a priority.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.900]   So I don't know that programs
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.340]   don't want you to use your points.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.740]   They do because they want you
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.980]   to be engaged with the program.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.060]   They want you to be a repeat customer.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.820]   They want you to have that satisfaction
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.000]   of redeeming your points
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.780]   because then you're going to commit to earning more points.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.340]   Like those are, that's what loyalty is.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.920]   All those things are important.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   But they are burdened by using computer systems
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.980]   from like the Apollo era in some cases (laughs)
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.520]   where literally they're using DOS-based systems still
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.360]   in some cases.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.960]   I think one of the most public examples of this,
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.600]   and I think it's to the credit of the program
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.040]   that they shared this,
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.400]   was Aeroplan with their Aeroplan 2020 project,
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   which they started in 2016,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.800]   knowing that they were going to buy back
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.480]   their loyalty program.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.000]   They were going to modernize their technology
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.680]   and move off of Resy 2,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.320]   which was their old reservation system,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.400]   which Resy 2 because it came about in like the 1980s
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.840]   rather than what they had before.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.560]   So moving from that technology
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.480]   that's literally older than us
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.400]   into something more modern took them five and a half years.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.560]   So it's these huge technical lifts
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.760]   and that's the case with a lot of this.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.080]   There are still airlines
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.720]   where they are taking their award inventory,
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   and it's a CSV file that they're uploading
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.920]   from time to time into their other inventory system.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.880]   Their revenue management systems aren't tied
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.920]   with their airline inventory systems.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.720]   And if the person who's in charge of uploading the CSV
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.480]   isn't there that week,
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.280]   then award inventory doesn't get added that week.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.600]   You have to wait until the next week.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.160]   Fortunately, that's rare.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.240]   But when you talk about why is this so hard,
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.040]   that's why it's so hard.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.280]   It's they don't have super robust computer systems.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.120]   And we live in an era that requires
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.880]   some super robust computer systems.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.360]   - In today's internet age,
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   people's personal information is being shared online
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.960]   with the click of a button without their consent,
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.040]   and it happens all the time.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.680]   But you can tackle this problem
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.560]   thanks to Delete Me from Abine,
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.440]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.880]   for this episode.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.160]   When I used to Google myself,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.720]   I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.240]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email,
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.680]   family members, and a lot more.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.120]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself,
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.280]   which you can do.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.920]   But after at least 10 hours,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.160]   I signed up for Delete Me,
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.000]   and it was so much easier.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.840]   Their software and team of experts
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.760]   will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.240]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.000]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.040]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.200]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.000]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.800]   in their first two years.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.760]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.120]   removed from search results on the web,
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.400]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.280]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.440]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.240]   You all know I love credit card points,
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.160]   so I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.800]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.520]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.720]   all of your credit cards in one place
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.840]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.440]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.660]   You can also load it on your partner's phone,
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.640]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.080]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards,
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   and they also track and help you use your Amex,
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.280]   Chase, Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.760]   to save even more money every day.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.240]   And with their browser extension,
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.040]   you can actually activate every single Amex
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.460]   and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.940]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.440]   you can do all of this without having to give up
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.000]   any personal or banking details.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.760]   The app is free to download,
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.200]   and many of the features are free as well,
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.920]   but if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.240]   there's a free trial.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.080]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.740]   which you probably will,
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.680]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.400]   to get 20% off.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.080]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.580]   and supporting the show.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.400]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.120]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.880]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.440]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.600]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.640]   I remember a handful of companies trying to make this easy.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.540]   Like there were plenty of people that were like,
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.380]   "We're gonna help you find the award flights."
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.680]   How did you guys end up making it work?
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.480]   Was it relationships with airlines?
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.040]   Was it just software?
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.040]   How is that possible?
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.000]   - Ultimately, I think what it is,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.120]   without getting into like secret sauce and things like that,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.760]   although of course we can talk about some of that,
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.900]   but ultimately I think it's the experience and the knowledge.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.160]   Other people have tried this,
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.840]   but most of the time it's been people
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   who are parachuting into the space,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.920]   and they're looking at it and being like,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   "Oh, here's an opportunity.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.420]   "I love opportunities.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.920]   "I'm gonna do this."
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   But they don't have the decades of really deep knowledge
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.840]   of airline inventory systems,
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.040]   and especially as they relate to loyalty management.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.360]   And that's not repeatable.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.280]   No one else has that.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.620]   It's just a handful of people
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.020]   who would have had it to begin with,
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.320]   and we're all working on point me.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.420]   So I think that's the thing.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:45.800]   It is not an exaggeration when I say
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.580]   that even people who work at airlines
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:51.260]   don't understand how their systems work, in many cases,
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.860]   as far as it relates to their business rules
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:59.320]   or their routing logic or their partner relationships.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.160]   They don't know.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:00.980]   We know.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.980]   And so we were able to take that knowledge
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.080]   and build out all of those data relationships
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.580]   and those ontologies and those different structures
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.040]   that allow you to then create the business logic
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.020]   and the tool itself.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.900]   But you have to have all that knowledge
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.900]   to give it to the software, right?
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.500]   You can't just make an app.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.720]   - And for people who haven't heard me talk about it before,
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.980]   you can correct me, but I'll give my pitch for it.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.460]   - Okay, your pitch is probably better
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.540]   than my pitch at this point.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.340]   - Basically, you've built this tool
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.500]   where I can go in and say,
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:36.000]   "I wanna go from destination A to destination B
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.720]   "on these dates in business or economy
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.740]   "with this many people."
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.380]   And you'll go out and run the 30 browser tab search
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.900]   on your side and come back in a couple minutes
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.540]   with here's exactly what's available
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.260]   across all the airlines.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.380]   And because you've gone in and said,
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.240]   I have Chase points or I have Amex points
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.080]   or Capital One points,
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.540]   here's the cheapest way to book it.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.820]   And I'm pretty sure it's also like,
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.980]   and here are the instructions
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.620]   on how to transfer them and book it.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.580]   - Yeah, step-by-step.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.140]   Here's how I would book it myself.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.140]   I think the thing that is worth noting
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.780]   and maybe goes into what you were talking about,
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.880]   how airlines make this difficult for themselves,
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.260]   not just for us, but for themselves.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.500]   We're not just going out and doing 30 searches.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.580]   You know, we're pulling inventory
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.220]   from like 35 different places at this point in time.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.060]   And we're continuing to refine our data sources.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:25.020]   We're also applying all of the routing rules and the logic.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.100]   So things that airline websites themselves don't always show
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.460]   but we know to work.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.900]   And then there's things that like,
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.140]   we know that the airline website doesn't show it either.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.060]   And we're still trying to figure out
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.220]   how we best present it without causing frustration.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.620]   And I can give a real-time example.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.980]   Delta is partners with China Airlines,
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.660]   which is a Taipei-based airline.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.020]   And I don't know if it's political reasons
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.820]   or technical reasons,
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.980]   but you can't find routings on delta.com
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.260]   connecting through Taipei on China Airlines very easily.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.300]   It requires a lot of manipulation of the website
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.620]   in a way that no other airport code requires.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.420]   So ultimately those things generally have to get booked
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:02.880]   over the phone if they're bookable at all,
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.460]   but we know that they're there.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.280]   And so that's something that Point Me can do
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.220]   is we can look at, okay, well, we know the slide is here.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.840]   We can combine this and we can tell you
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.660]   what the price should be.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.980]   And then it's here's the instructions
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.020]   because you're going to have to call.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.700]   And this is the magic word
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.300]   that you're going to have to say to the airline agent
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.020]   in order for them to be able to find the inventory.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.380]   And so sometimes we go through that
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.220]   and we decide that this is actually too complicated.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.420]   Let's pause this for now.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.980]   Let's maybe not show this result.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.540]   So we do a lot of that triangulation,
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.900]   a lot of that verification.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.740]   If we see something that's available
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.340]   on Airplane's website and on United's website,
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.460]   but it's not available
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.820]   through a third Star Alliance carrier,
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.900]   we go through this whole check process of
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.220]   is this space actually available to Star Alliance?
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.860]   Is it phantom space?
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.260]   Which is when one of these airline websites
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.600]   is just making things up
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.620]   and they display a flight that's not bookable.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.640]   So we try and go through and filter that as well
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.080]   and apply our knowledge.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.380]   So people aren't getting frustrated
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.220]   by trying to book things that aren't there.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.020]   - The reason I reached out to you originally to say,
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.860]   hey, is there any way we can get a deal for listeners
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.700]   was because I was like,
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.100]   this is the tool I want to recommend.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.080]   And so anyone that does the standard monthly membership
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.580]   can get the first month for a dollar
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.060]   with the code, all the hacks.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.980]   And that's what I tell people to do.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.140]   And I would tell them to do it
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.340]   if you didn't have a discount code,
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.100]   but it's nicer for them to get one.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:19.220]   - We did want to do that
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.260]   and just make it easy for people who have points
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:22.300]   because everyone has points
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.780]   and no one really knows how to use them.
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.620]   And I can teach you how to do it by hand.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.260]   We have 30,000 blog posts on one mile at a time
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.820]   if you want to do this by hand.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.180]   I don't know who has time to read 30,000 blog posts though,
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.340]   but if you want to, like there's an option available to you.
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.540]   You don't have to pay anything to learn how to do this,
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:42.140]   but there is a market for people who don't want to do that.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.980]   They don't want to open 30 or 60 browser tabs.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.840]   They just want to see what their options are,
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.740]   get a sense of what the prices are
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.660]   so that they can do their goal posting
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.940]   as they're earning their points.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.820]   And just to be like, wow, great to know
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.460]   that I can do San Francisco, Paris
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.740]   with Flying Blue on the nonstop.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.340]   Didn't realize the fuel surcharges
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.500]   were going to be $450 a person.
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.540]   I'm going to think about that and be informed
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.900]   and then be able to make a decision
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.740]   and discuss and contemplate their travel plan.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.260]   That's really what we wanted for Point Me
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.380]   was to just help people not feel like the space
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.300]   was completely opaque and impenetrable,
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.420]   that they could be informed and make travel choices.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.980]   - The advice I often give people is,
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.100]   look, if you want to do a quick search,
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.860]   pull up like the main three domestic carriers,
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.620]   pull up United, pull up Air France,
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.740]   pull up British Airways, you could do three searches.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.540]   That's not going to get you a comprehensive view.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.180]   Like by all means, I've done that three airline search
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.260]   and then I've gone to Point Me
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.700]   and I've gotten results that I didn't find.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.540]   But sometimes you find exactly
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.820]   what you're looking for on search one
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.140]   and you don't need the other 59 browser tabs.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.340]   - And that is why I like to say,
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.420]   like start with the Wikipedia page
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.820]   of the airport you want to go to,
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.540]   because it gives you some bounds
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.540]   for your browser tab experience, right?
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.380]   And you can look and be like,
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.780]   oh, okay, so I'm looking at this list.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.940]   There's not a single Star Alliance carrier.
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.300]   Granted, you also have to open the tab
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.540]   for Star Alliance carriers.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.020]   So you're two tabs,
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.060]   but there's not a single Star Alliance carrier
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:04.900]   that flies here.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.980]   Maybe there's not a benefit
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.260]   of even opening United or Aeroplan,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.780]   but like, oh, there's three different
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.380]   one world carriers that fly here.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.220]   So I can just use the Alaska tool or the American tool
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.820]   or the Qantas tool or the British Airways tool
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.340]   or whichever one I'm most familiar with
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.540]   and most comfortable using.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:20.780]   And I can look at space there.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.300]   - I can't speak to this product because I haven't used it,
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.420]   but someone emailed me from a company called Flights From,
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.660]   and I pulled up the product and I just looked at it.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.340]   You can go in and say,
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.900]   all nonstop flights from Paris filter by Star Alliance.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.300]   And it actually shows you all the flights there,
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.340]   days of the week, what airlines they are.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.220]   I'm not getting paid to promote this product,
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.900]   but for someone who wants something more visual
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.060]   than Wikipedia, which by the way,
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.620]   Wikipedia was also my path.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.180]   I'm always like, Wiki, CDG, go look and look at the airline.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.140]   I feel sometimes you get like, oh, this is seasonal.
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.300]   It's not going to start till next November.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.140]   Whereas if you just search a flight connection-
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.100]   - The seasonal thing is so helpful
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.980]   because I always get people who are like, oh my gosh,
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.340]   you know, I want to fly nonstop to Nice.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.380]   It's like, okay, there is one freaking flight
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.060]   from the US to Nice and it's seasonal.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.540]   And they're like, oh, but my friend just took it.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.060]   Yes, in the season, right?
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.620]   It's November, it is not the season.
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.740]   - But I did play around on this site for a little bit.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.580]   And I was like, oh, this is a tool I would like.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.940]   I can look at a routing map filter for where does it go?
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.780]   So throw it out there.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.140]   If anyone uses it- - Yeah, I'm looking at it now.
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.140]   I think that's really fun.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:25.620]   The one thing that I would caution with looking at this,
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.260]   'cause you know I have to have a caution,
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.620]   is that it looks like it includes
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:30.540]   a lot of low cost carriers,
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.220]   which is phenomenal for thinking about
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.980]   how you can be flexible,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:38.260]   but is not going to be good for using your points.
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.580]   'Cause you generally can't use your points
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:41.060]   on those low cost carriers.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.260]   - My hack there was I went in
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.980]   and I just checked like Star Alliance.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.300]   - Yeah, the same thing that you can do
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.140]   on Google Flights then,
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.180]   where you can just be like, just show me Star Alliance
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.740]   or just show me One World.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.620]   - Yeah, I guess Google Flights just does all this also.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.020]   I don't know why I was looking for a new tool.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.580]   It's just sometimes I'm like, what airlines fly here?
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.180]   - I actually do think that the low cost carrier feature
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.380]   is super helpful 'cause you often don't see those
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.540]   and they matter.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.740]   We used to live in Sicily and like,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.300]   yes, there were a couple of Alitalia flights,
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.460]   but mostly it was going to be EasyJet or Ryanair
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.780]   or Air Malta or things that you couldn't use points on
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:19.820]   and you weren't going to find searching other consolidators,
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.220]   unless you knew to look for them.
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.140]   Knowing where to look is hugely valuable.
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.700]   - Are there any other tools in the space online
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.540]   that you use or recommend people check out
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.380]   when they're trying to think about award travel?
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.820]   - I think it depends on what you want to do.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.700]   I don't want it to be a plug,
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.340]   but this gets into why we built PointMe
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.340]   because there are things like, I use ExpertFlyer every day,
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:42.900]   but more for schedules and upgrade space potentially
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:43.740]   and things like that.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.020]   You can use it for award inventory,
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:50.100]   but ExpertFlyer, like if you know that A space
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.460]   is first class in Alaska and W is economy,
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.120]   you can pull up ExpertFlyer, you can search for it that way.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.980]   But it requires a lot of knowledge
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.100]   to be able to use it effectively
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.460]   and requires you to know the routing rules.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.700]   It can find you space,
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.340]   but it doesn't tell you the combined ability.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.420]   So if you are getting deeper in the rabbit hole
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.000]   and you're really interested in those kinds of things,
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.340]   I think you get to a point where ExpertFlyer is indispensable
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.500]   for sort of cobbling those things together
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.620]   and be like, oh my gosh, I should actually book
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.700]   premium economy on Virgin Atlantic on this route
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.660]   and then I should upgrade
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:25.900]   because then I'll get my extra MQMs for Delta.
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.060]   When you get into that level,
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.260]   you definitely need some of those more technical tools
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.860]   that aren't necessarily as user-friendly,
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.700]   but do have really great information.
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:33.800]   - Yeah, I will point one thing out
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.020]   that you just brushed over,
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.580]   which is just because you find award availability
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.620]   between two cities doesn't mean
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.860]   that you can always combine it.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.060]   So I've had times where it's like,
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.900]   oh, I can go from San Francisco to Paris
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.020]   and Paris to Athens.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.420]   And I like looked at each individual leg
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.720]   happens to have an award flight that's reasonably priced,
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.420]   but when combining them, it doesn't always work.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.160]   I know you guys do that in your search,
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.660]   but I would just caution people.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.620]   I'm curious what you think about this.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.100]   Sometimes I'm like, okay, I wanna get to Europe.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.620]   So let's not look at the ultimate destination.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.860]   Let's just look at like the transatlantic flights.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.620]   And that's like how I sometimes narrow it down.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.240]   I'm not gonna take two stops.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.220]   So like, I wanna get from San Francisco to Athens.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.080]   If you're willing to say,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.140]   I'm only gonna change planes once.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:19.860]   And ideally it's not a six hour flight to the East Coast.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.220]   You can kind of narrow it down to like,
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.380]   maybe there's only seven routings you could take
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.220]   or 10 routings.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.460]   You could just kind of systematically
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.860]   check those seven to 10,
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.020]   but just make sure that you check them
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.860]   all together by the end.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.820]   Otherwise you might end up finding out
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:33.660]   that it doesn't actually work.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.980]   - Right, and the altogether at the end will also matter
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.340]   based on what program you're booking through.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.580]   That phenomenon you're describing
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.500]   is referred to as married segment itineraries.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.420]   There are many cases where,
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.960]   let's say it's Lufthansa 'cause they do this a lot,
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.800]   where they'll say,
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.380]   sure, if you are coming from San Francisco,
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.240]   of course we'll make sure that there's space
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.440]   all the way through to Athens for you or vice versa.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.280]   And they'll say,
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.100]   this isn't necessarily combinable on a ward
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.380]   because we don't need to make inventory available
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.480]   on the Frankfurt Athens route.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.240]   It's going to sell out anyways.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.160]   So there's a lot of that.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.660]   And it can depend because even within an alliance,
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:15.460]   some partners have better access
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.220]   to those married segment itineraries,
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.660]   or they are willing to pay a little bit more
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:22.480]   to their partner to have access to that space.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.720]   Or sometimes, especially in the US,
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.200]   this segment is only available
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.260]   to members of our loyalty program.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.820]   So Delta or United or American
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.260]   might even be able to give you a great discount
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.860]   on that flight from San Francisco to Salt Lake,
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.460]   but they're not gonna make it available
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.020]   to their alliance partners.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.380]   So you wouldn't be able to combine it
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.860]   if you then saw space on flying blue.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.140]   - If someone's thinking, okay, I want to take a trip.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.060]   Is there an easy way to just get a good sense
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.020]   of like how much it might cost?
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.900]   It used to be years ago, there's just an award chart.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.580]   It's like, okay, I could go pull up the award chart
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.620]   for a few airlines.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.940]   I remember United, it was like every domestic flight
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.580]   was 25,000 points in coach
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.900]   and 50,000 points in business round trip.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:04.860]   And it was just so simple.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.340]   It's like, you want to go to Europe?
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.580]   This is the cost.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.980]   I think some airlines still have that.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.820]   But for the most part,
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.900]   it seems like everything is a mixed bag.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.380]   How could someone get a sense of
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.980]   what might it cost a family of four to go to Europe
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.380]   without necessarily having to go through all the searching?
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.460]   - So many programs still have award charts.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.740]   American Advantage still has an award chart
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.700]   for their partners.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.660]   And I think that's actually probably a good place to look.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.500]   They still publish it.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.820]   And a lot of things are in that range.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.940]   So if you're like, I have no idea, ballpark,
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.900]   what I should be spending, that gives you a sense.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.820]   It gives you a starting place.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.420]   And Delta or United or Aeroplan may charge more
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.940]   or less, but at least you have the right number
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.660]   of significant figures for the most part.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.860]   The flip side of not everybody having award charts
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.060]   is that with the dynamic pricing,
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.140]   sometimes you can see really low prices
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.260]   that would never have made it onto an award chart
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.820]   just based off of inventory capacity.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.420]   I mentioned earlier Virgin Atlantic will have
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.780]   just bargain flights from New York to London,
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.460]   10,000 miles in economy.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.420]   And if you stack that with a transfer bonus
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.940]   and where you're getting a 30% bonus
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.860]   when you transfer your chase points to Virgin Atlantic,
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.900]   it's just a steal.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.340]   That would never show up on an award chart.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.700]   It's not a consistent price necessarily,
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.380]   but it happens often enough that I can speak to it
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.940]   because it's not like a one-off, right?
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.220]   It happens with some consistency
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.060]   when they have extra space on a plane.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.460]   So the dynamic inventory is hard, right?
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.580]   Because we all like to know how much things
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.340]   are going to cost and be able to work towards them.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.020]   I think that's such a key component of loyalty programs.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.860]   But the little bit of the crumb that you're getting there
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.460]   at least is that there are sometimes
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.020]   some really great values on the other side,
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.500]   especially domestically, I think where you get some prices
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.420]   that you wouldn't have anticipated.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.420]   - When people listen, you're like, okay, I now get it.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.180]   I feel confident about how I could start to plan this trip
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.460]   and book this and find availability.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.380]   But now I gotta go get those 300,000 points.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.740]   We've talked plenty about, okay, well,
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.660]   you can get the card that optimizes
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.500]   where you spend your money.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.940]   You can get some signup bonuses
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.260]   and keep on top of what they are.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.940]   And I try to share that.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.980]   Any other hacks or tips or tactics
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.220]   that you like to share with people
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.180]   who are trying to get to that mileage goal
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.380]   so they could take the trip?
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.980]   - Yeah, that's really a fun question.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.940]   So I think in general,
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.180]   I like to encourage people to be opportunistic.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.460]   And there is a great signup bonus to take advantage of it.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.460]   I'm also at a place where I recognize
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.540]   that people who are doing this also have full-time jobs.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.420]   And so you don't necessarily want to be in a situation
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.460]   where you have so many cards
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.860]   and they're hard to manage and things like that.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.100]   But I think it's important to think about it.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.540]   And if you're planning like an extended family trip,
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.580]   maybe you have that conversation with the extended family
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.380]   and say, "Hey, this is the trip we want to take.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.940]   "It's going to be this many points.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.820]   "In our household, we're going to get that
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.220]   "because we're both going to get this card."
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.300]   That might be an option for you.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.140]   You don't want to be in charge
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.500]   of your family's finances overall.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.460]   It's a bad, bad life choice.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.100]   But to think about that
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:54.100]   and to be sure that as you are getting credit cards,
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.220]   that your points are ultimately combinable.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.380]   I think this is especially important if you have a family
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.620]   or if you're more than one person in general,
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.820]   is, okay, it doesn't help you to have 50,000 points here
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.660]   and 60,000 points here and 70,000 points here.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.220]   You may find yourself in a situation
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.660]   where you have half a million points
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.780]   and you don't have enough points
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.420]   for a single round trip international ticket
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.860]   because they're not combinable.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.900]   So that's, I think, the second level thing
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.180]   is don't just get the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.020]   because it has a big signup bonus.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.180]   Like, that's great, do that.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.740]   But then when you go to get your next card,
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.140]   look at, okay, well, where could these points move to?
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.580]   I want to make sure that my next card,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.180]   I can also move those points to the same places
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.340]   or it bolsters one of those balances there.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.260]   And just make sure you have a couple hundred thousand points
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.860]   in a program or able to get to a program
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.300]   before you move on to the next thing.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.860]   - My advice has been, you can now,
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.820]   for most airlines, book one-way awards.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.460]   I always say, instead of trying to book like,
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.300]   oh, we're two people and we have enough points
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.140]   in two programs, book the one-ways together,
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.460]   both be on the same itinerary with one program,
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.580]   and then the return with the other program
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.260]   instead of trying to book each person separately.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.180]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.660]   Especially if you have one person
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.460]   who's not as confident of a traveler
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.900]   or you have extended family members.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.740]   I always talk about, like,
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.820]   when we're traveling with our moms,
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.900]   it's totally different than when we're traveling
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.100]   just with each other.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.260]   And I think that that's key, like,
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.380]   staying on the same itinerary.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.300]   And again, are you getting points in a program?
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.500]   So maybe it's more thinking of like,
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.700]   am I getting points in an account, right?
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.420]   Because if you have 50,000 points in United Mileage Plus
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.220]   and your partner has 50,000 points in United Mileage Plus,
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.180]   you still neither together nor separately
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.740]   have enough points to do what you wanna do.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.700]   If you have 100,000 points in one account,
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.260]   you have more options.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.540]   - Alyssa actually reminded me,
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.780]   I know Capital One, you can share points with anyone.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.660]   So if you have Capital One points, you can.
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.740]   With Chase, I think it's within your household.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.580]   So if you're both accumulating Chase,
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.100]   you can share within your household.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.100]   Amex, most of the actual airlines though,
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.620]   make it incredibly difficult and costly to share points.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.980]   So another bump to the transferable points game
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.860]   is that it is very hard.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   If you have American points
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.740]   and someone else has American points,
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.340]   combining them for a trip,
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.580]   a few of the international carriers have programs for this,
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.500]   but it's very hard.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.540]   - Yeah, you should combine them
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.900]   before they get to the airline.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.620]   The nice thing though, is that for the most part,
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.140]   all the airlines will let you book tickets for someone else.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.700]   And we hear this all the time
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.020]   because we have the grandparents
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.020]   who wanna pay for a honeymoon
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.140]   and they're like, "How do I get my Amex points?"
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.060]   To my granddaughter, it's like, "You don't.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:24.740]   "We'll take your Amex points
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.380]   "and we'll move them to maybe your AeroPlan account
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:30.700]   "and then we'll book the flights for her from your account."
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.420]   You don't have to transfer them to other people
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.100]   and pay transfer fees.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.820]   - But if you and your spouse both have,
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.820]   let's call it 50,000 Amex points
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.780]   and you wanna book an award that's 100,000,
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.800]   there's no good answer.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.260]   You can't combine Amex points.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.940]   But my version of a hack,
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.780]   which I think is still possible,
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.020]   is that if you add your spouse
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.720]   as your authorized cardholder,
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.780]   then you can transfer points from Amex to their accounts.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.620]   - Correct, yeah.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.900]   If it's an authorized user,
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.180]   then you can transfer them to the same account.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.380]   - So you can't combine the membership rewards balances,
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.380]   but if you're transferring to Delta,
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.900]   you could transfer them both to the same Delta account
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.740]   and book from there.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:06.560]   - Right.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.780]   I would say if you are going to do that,
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.100]   and you know you're going to do that,
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.780]   there is a high potential for the airline
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.900]   to put a fraud alert on the account
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.060]   if you're getting back-to-back transfers
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.880]   from different accounts in short succession.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.720]   They'll resolve it.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.100]   It's not going to be actual fraud.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.180]   It's just going to be something that needs manual approval.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.660]   So if you are in a situation where it's like,
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.780]   "Oh my gosh, I know that I'm going to book this flight,"
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.700]   or you find this diamond in the rough award space
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.020]   that you would never have been able to book,
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.180]   and you're moving all these points all around
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.340]   to temper expectations,
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.420]   because it might be 72 hours
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.540]   before those points are cleared for you to book it,
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.300]   in that specific example.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.640]   I don't want to dissuade anyone from earning points.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.480]   - No, no.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.300]   (laughing)
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.340]   - It's good to know that there can be pitfalls.
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.540]   - One important thing, actually,
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.140]   that came up with another listener
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.780]   was there are a lot of mileage programs
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.920]   where it's like you can't transfer points in for 72 hours,
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.180]   or there's some rules about how long the account
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.220]   has to be open before you can book something.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.280]   So one suggestion I have is if you have Chase,
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.580]   it doesn't cost you anything
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.540]   to go to a dozen or so Chase airline partners
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.620]   and go open all of those mileage accounts now.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.460]   - Yeah, why not?
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.020]   - I don't know if you know exactly which ones,
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.680]   but I know there are at least a few airlines
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.780]   where it's much better to have had the account open
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.580]   than open it when you need it.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.220]   - Yeah, I would actually say with almost any of them,
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.260]   it's better.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.880]   And again, this is just security checks
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.740]   are all driven by algorithms.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.980]   It's obviously more suspicious
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   to have a brand new account that was just opened
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.340]   and now is receiving points from non-flight activity
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.580]   from multiple sources in 90 minutes.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.500]   Like if you're a computer, you flag that too.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.660]   So you can just avoid some of those triggers
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.640]   by opening the accounts early on,
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.620]   maybe make a purchase
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.140]   through the airline shopping portal early on.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.140]   I don't want the takeaway from this though
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.300]   to be that like airlines are super concerned about fraud
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.340]   and that you're going to run into problems
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.300]   when you're reviewing your points.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:57.060]   This gets into like the edge cases of it.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.280]   Most people are not going to have these problems.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.180]   It can happen.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.340]   So you might as well season the accounts a bit.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.400]   - But there are some airlines
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.140]   where I think you can't actually do anything.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.540]   Even if they don't flag you for fraud,
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.360]   they just have a rule.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.340]   It's like your account has to be open for a week
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.180]   or that kind of stuff.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.620]   - Yeah, and there's others where can't search award space
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.900]   unless you have a couple of points in the account.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.460]   And if you can't search award space,
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.940]   that means you can't book award flights,
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:22.920]   but you don't necessarily need
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.580]   to have the full number of points.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.980]   But if you have two points in there or five points
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:31.340]   because you bought something through their shopping portal
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.140]   and posted the points there,
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.180]   then you can have full functionality.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.820]   - And the other one is I've had some issues.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.840]   I can't remember exactly why,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.660]   but my name is long enough that sometimes
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.840]   when I try to add an airline to my Amex account
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.820]   to transfer points out, it's like, ah, it didn't work.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.820]   So I would also say, if you go and create
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.100]   an airline mileage account for all these airlines
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:52.940]   that you can transfer to,
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.180]   you can also go and link those accounts
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:59.340]   to your Amex, Chase, CapOne account as well.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.540]   And the thing I'm ultimately trying to help everyone avoid
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.380]   is you don't wanna go and find a flight
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.220]   and be ready to book it.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.660]   Finally, I found the availability.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:11.480]   - Right, and now it all falls apart.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.660]   - Now I need to wait three days for my account to be active
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.800]   or my account was active, but now that I linked to Amex,
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.580]   there's like some error and I have to get Amex
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.500]   to help resolve the error before it works.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.020]   So I like to put all those pieces in place.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.580]   - That's actually maybe the next level of things
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.920]   is when you are applying for credit cards
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.940]   to apply for them with the name
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.460]   that is on your secure flight information.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.300]   And this might seem obvious to people.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.540]   Like American Express will issue you a credit card
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:44.540]   as C. Hutchins, but Flying Blue won't allow you
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.840]   to create a Flying Blue account with C. Hutchins.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.380]   It needs to be Chris or Christopher
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.860]   or whatever is on your passport.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.060]   And so when you go to transfer the points, they won't match.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.420]   And so Flying Blue will send the points back.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.500]   And I think a lot of us with like shorter names
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.900]   or I have two middle names,
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.820]   so I just never include them on anything
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.380]   because it's too complicated.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.220]   But it's like, oh, I'm just applying for this credit card.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.760]   I'm not thinking about using my full legal name
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.700]   as it is on my passport.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.540]   Just to add something else
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.740]   to make it a little bit more complicated for everybody.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:13.260]   - Any other travel points, miles,
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.100]   broad speaking, tactics, tricks,
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.460]   hacks to share before we wrap?
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.740]   - I think the biggest thing to think about
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:23.060]   is that you can absolutely use your points.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.220]   People get so overwhelmed.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.260]   They get so wrapped up in trying to optimize
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.240]   and find the very best example,
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.620]   or they see influencers who are doing things
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.100]   and they think that there's only one way
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.460]   to redeem their points.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.260]   At the end of the day, the best use of your points
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:39.780]   is one that allows you to have an experience
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.300]   that might have otherwise been out of reach.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.460]   Whether that's a trip that was expensive
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.620]   or a trip that was difficult
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.620]   or a trip that was super aspirational and lovely
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.860]   and to just not be afraid to go ahead and book it.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.060]   It's not a contest, it's not a race.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.460]   And there are some tremendous ways to improve your life
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.460]   through these experiences, just go for it.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.500]   If it's not perfect, then maybe the next one will be better.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.820]   And you learn so much going through that first process
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.460]   of booking an award flight
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.580]   that you didn't apply to the second.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.420]   But I find so many people are too intimidated
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.740]   to book the first one.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.060]   - And hopefully, I think people can leave this saying,
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.980]   "Okay, I feel like I understand how the system works
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.880]   so I can do some searching myself.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.060]   I know of at least one tool that you guys have built
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.520]   that will make this a lot easier."
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.820]   When do you think that actually makes sense for someone?
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.380]   - The reason why we set a point up the way that we did
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:29.900]   and why we're happy to, for certain audiences like yours,
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.120]   give a really significant discount to use it for a month
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.060]   is because we are pretty evangelical
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.500]   about using points as an option.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.140]   So for a dollar, you can spend a whole month
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.360]   clicking around and just sort of seeing what the options are.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.780]   And we have the instructions laid out for you
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.540]   step by step by step.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:47.880]   And I do truly think that for most people,
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.100]   if you just try, maybe even take a theoretical trip,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.100]   one that you're not emotionally committed to yet,
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   but you've just thought about wanting to take
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.380]   and go through the steps,
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.220]   and maybe you're not actually transferring your points,
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.140]   but you're sitting there and thinking,
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.820]   "Okay, this is the point where I would go
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:02.980]   to my credit card company
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.060]   and I would transfer the points.
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.880]   And okay, I see now how I would book."
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.500]   And just play with it and build that confidence in doing it
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500]   because it doesn't have to be overwhelming.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.540]   There's a lot of information.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.980]   There's a lot that you could do.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:16.120]   There's a lot of ways that you could maximize
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.660]   the heck out of it.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.400]   At the end of the day, it's not that much more difficult
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.140]   than other things that you'd successfully do
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.980]   every week of your life, right?
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.340]   You're just applying that skillset
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.520]   and those abilities to something different.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.140]   And you only are able to do new things
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.060]   when you practice them.
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.620]   We work really hard at Point Me
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.900]   to give you all the tools that you need to be successful.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.420]   We're checking to make sure that it's actual flights
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.460]   that you can actually book
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.740]   with the points you actually have.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.380]   And we have step-by-step instructions,
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.420]   including little videos of like,
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.660]   "Here's where you go to click."
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.540]   So ideally, anyone should be able to do this.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.580]   And I laugh because we say this, but it's true.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.020]   Like we've tested it with our moms
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.540]   who are not the most tech-savvy group of ladies out there,
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.960]   although we love them.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:59.140]   So I do really hope that by using the self-serve tool there
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.880]   that for a very moderate price,
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.740]   you're equipped and you can book travel.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.580]   If you are somebody though,
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.140]   who has a lot of points and a lot of different accounts
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.380]   or with different family members,
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.980]   or you're planning something that is complicated,
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.380]   but you know specifically what you wanna do,
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.780]   it's just too complicated and it's too intimidating.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.700]   We do have a team of people that can book that for you.
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.860]   It's obviously much, much, much more expensive
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.520]   than the self-serve tool,
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.260]   but that is an option that's available as well.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.060]   - Cool. I feel like we covered a lot.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.260]   I'm sure I'll have some questions.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.240]   I'll do the next Q&A as a follow-up to this.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.500]   If people have questions, I might even send you some.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.380]   But one thing I like to do before we wrap up every time
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.940]   is you've been to a bunch of countries, more than me,
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.820]   more than probably most people listening.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.780]   Are there a couple of places that you think
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.200]   might not be on someone's radar?
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.820]   Like you mentioned earlier, your new focus on travel
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.340]   isn't just the place everyone goes.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.020]   Are there a couple of places that you'd say
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.060]   people should check out
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.960]   and maybe something interesting they could do
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.660]   while they're there that might make it
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.140]   an exciting destination?
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:59.260]   - I think that Malaysia is really underrated
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.220]   for people who are looking for a trip to Asia.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.980]   Incredible food, really welcoming people,
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.540]   fantastic beaches on a lot of the islands.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.500]   I think that that's some place
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.700]   that people should really consider.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.540]   And then I'm, of course, biased
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.180]   because I've lived in Sicily and people go to Italy,
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.500]   but they don't really go to Sicily to the same extent.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.880]   And I think if you are an independent traveler
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.520]   or you're open to, again,
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.600]   having to work for it a little bit,
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.840]   that there's some really incredible experiences there,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.620]   some agriturismos that you can stay at
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.380]   where you're getting a much warmer experience
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.660]   than you'd find on a lot of mainland Italy.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:36.820]   And it's an interesting history and archeology
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.940]   and all those things, too,
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:40.260]   that not as much on the tourist trail.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:41.100]   - Cool.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.540]   Tiffany, thank you so much for being here.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.380]   This is great.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.580]   I appreciate it.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:45.580]   - Of course, thanks for having me.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.780]   I hope it was helpful and demystifying for people.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.020]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.780]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.920]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.720]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.440]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.880]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.260]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.520]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.600]   That's it for this week.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.800]   I'll see you next week.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.720]   (electronic beeping)
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.800]   (electronic beeping)
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.860]   you
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.920]   you
