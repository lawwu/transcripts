[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Jessica says, "I should start with the fact that I am neurodivergent and a very anxious
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.000]   person, which might answer part of the question.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   But I wonder how I can make myself stick to a simple productivity system instead of revamping
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.120]   everything pretty much every week.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.160]   I always feel like if I could just find the perfect system, it would fix everything."
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.700]   Well, Jessica, I don't think your concerns here are specifically due to neurodivergence
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.700]   or anxiety.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.320]   It's common among people who get serious about how they organize their digital era knowledge
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.000]   work.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   Part of the problem is a lot of people put, I would say, too much faith in what their
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.720]   productivity system can accomplish for them.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.280]   But here's the thing, productivity systems, they cannot do your work for you.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.720]   They cannot in themselves make you successful at your job.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.080]   They certainly cannot fix everything.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.200]   In the world of digital knowledge work, what do productivity systems actually do?
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.480]   Two things.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   They can help you make consistent and smart decisions about what to work on.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.220]   So it gets you out of that, free you from that mode of reactivity of just, "Oh my God,
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.220]   something's due.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.220]   Someone just emailed me.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.440]   I'm just trying to answer these incoming pings and put out the rapidly growing fires."
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.760]   They can also help you avoid unnecessarily wasting your time and attention.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.680]   So I'm going to be more careful about how I deal with my brain.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   I don't want to context switch too much.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.760]   I'm going to sort of build my scheduling and approach to work and my processes around one
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.400]   thing at a time, consolidating context switching, et cetera.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.540]   So smart decisions, planning, and help you avoid unnecessary drags on your time and attention
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.760]   so you get more out of your brain.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.260]   And this is more of scheduling and processes.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.080]   If you have ideas for both of those goals that are working for you, then you're getting
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.000]   most of the benefits a productivity system can get.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.840]   Now if you tune up the system, it'll be useful, but it's not going to be night or day.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.240]   Night or day is having something in place, planning that's smart for making decisions,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.400]   and scheduling and process things in place to help you not waste unnecessary time and
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   attention.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.980]   So going from zero to that is a huge win.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.220]   Beyond that, you know, it's like two users taste.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.220]   It can kind of make a difference.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.700]   It's not going to be night or day.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780]   So if you have something in place for both of these, and given that you're a longtime
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.900]   listener of the show you do, you're getting 80% of the benefits.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.880]   Now what about those other 20?
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.420]   Tune in once a quarter.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.980]   Once a quarter, be like, "Hey, what's working?
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.980]   What's not?"
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.980]   And make some tune-ups.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.780]   Don't have high expectations, but you do want to check in semi-regularly because you want
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.620]   to prune things out of these two points that aren't really working or wasting your time.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.180]   Or if there's a new type of challenge within these two points that has emerged that's not
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.240]   being addressed by your current systems or processes, you might want to tweak something
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.580]   or add something new, and this will help.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.300]   But I would see this more like the key thing is, I'm going to use a horticultural metaphor
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   here.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.500]   The key thing is you plant a tree, the tree that yields the fruit of consistent smart
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.380]   decisions and unnecessary wasting of time and attention.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.260]   That's the big deal is planting the tree, having the tree, having those fruits.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.620]   Now over time, you want to prune it.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.220]   If you don't prune it, it's going to grow wild, and maybe it's going to no longer produce
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.220]   any fruit.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.740]   So you can't just put something in there and let that go for the next five years.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.980]   But if you're just semi-regularly pruning this, the tree will keep growing and it'll
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.320]   keep delivering your fruits in some years better than others.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.980]   That's the way to think about this.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.420]   Don't put so much on the details of your system.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.580]   Yes, you need a system, but those are the two things that can do.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.340]   It can't do your job for you, it can't make work easy, it can't be I start turning this
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.380]   crank and on the other end, I'm the president.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.780]   It's not the way it works.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.860]   Work is hard.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.700]   In the end, you still have to give concentrated cognitive effort to things that are difficult
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.460]   to produce things that are valuable.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.340]   That's going to feel the same no matter what productivity system you have.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.220]   That's going to be hard no matter what productivity system you have.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.880]   You basically just want to try to clear out some of the biggest obvious obstacles to doing
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.940]   that in a sustainable fashion.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.020]   All right, our next question is from DK.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.180]   DK writes, "I often have a large block at 90 to 120 minutes of time at the start of
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.820]   my day.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.820]   I want to use this time more efficiently, but it often gets eaten up by setting up the
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.180]   rest of the day.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.740]   Even if I've completed a weekly and/or daily plan, I end up preparing for meetings, triaging
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.240]   my messages, or getting caught up on Slack threads.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.060]   How can I be more effective at the start of my day?"
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.260]   Well, DK, I have three ideas for you.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.420]   One, prepare the day before for what you're going to do at the start of your day.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.500]   Block off that time like a meeting on your calendar and have a set place you're going
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.460]   to go to do that work that's different than where you do Slack, that's different than
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.860]   where you think about your meeting prep.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.500]   Your day starts off not, "Okay, let's just rock and roll in all my channels and then
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   get to work."
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.860]   No, your day starts off, "I'm going to my writing set, I'm going to the coffee shop,
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.580]   I'm doing my 20-minute thinking walk to get going, and I have everything right here to
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.020]   start working on this code, this memo, this business strategy, whatever, this big project.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.260]   It is scheduled and that's what I do."
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.020]   You're going to be nervous about it, "What if I'm missing things?
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.900]   What if in that first 90 minutes really critical things happened?"
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.080]   You know what?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.180]   It won't and you'll be fine and then you'll stop worrying about it.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.420]   People can call you if it's urgent.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.620]   They'll respect it like, "Yeah, I start with hard things, then I get after like meetings
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.620]   in Slack."
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.180]   They'll be fine and you'll be fine.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.940]   So you just got to be more definitive about this.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.860]   All right, second thing to suggest, do more preparation at shutdown instead of the beginning
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.260]   of the day.
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.420]   Schedule the last half hour of your day and again, protect this on your calendar.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.860]   Let that be the time where you're preparing for the next day.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.820]   Shutting down open loops, "Do I have what I need for these meetings?
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.260]   If not, let me schedule time before the meeting to do the prep.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.060]   I like my plan for the day.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.060]   Okay.
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.060]   What am I doing to start the next day?
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.060]   Great.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.060]   Let me gather all my materials.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.060]   Great.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.060]   Schedule shutdown confirmed.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.860]   Check the schedule shutdown box on my time block planner.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.860]   Unload from work.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.860]   Next day starts.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.460]   You get right into the deep work you want to do in that day because you already went
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.820]   through all the process of looking at your next day.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.740]   Do it the day before, not the morning of."
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.340]   Third idea, do more meeting processing proximate to the meetings.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.520]   I'm a big believer of when you schedule a meeting, scheduling time either before, after,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.700]   or both.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.980]   Time before to prep for that meeting, if you need that.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.940]   Definitely time after, 15 to 30 minutes, always add that to your calendar to process everything
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.180]   that just happened in that meeting.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.180]   All right.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.460]   Let me just stop for a second.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.500]   What came out of this meeting?
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000]   What decisions were made?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.620]   What do I now need to do?
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.620]   What do I need to remember?
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.940]   Let me get that into my systems.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.620]   Let me update what I need to update.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.860]   I promised to contact these three people.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.260]   Let me contact those three people.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.260]   Okay.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.260]   Good.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.260]   I can now shut down that meeting.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.620]   If you go straight from a meeting to something else, all of that post-meeting work just sticks
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.300]   around in your head and causes a problem.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.380]   Meetings are not just a time you're talking to other people.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.940]   It's a time you're talking to other people and the time you need to make sense of that
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.940]   and prepare for it.
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.380]   Get that on your calendar as well.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.660]   Then you'll feel more sort of in control of what's going on, but mainly you just have
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   to protect that time.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.820]   You don't want to be doing slack and meeting prep during those first 90 minutes.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.820]   Don't.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.580]   Figure out a way to get that done without having to use your first 90 minutes.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.020]   I think the benefit will be worth it.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.860]   All right.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.180]   My next question is from Skeptical Sally.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.500]   This is someone talking about their partner.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   That's always fun.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.940]   Hi, Cal.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.260]   My partner is a director of product management at a startup, and despite having risen through
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.520]   the ranks there, he has yet to be rid of a lot of the lower level work on his plate.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.820]   He also has meetings all day, almost every day.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.180]   Many things cannot be done without his input, but he is predictably exhausted all the time
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.900]   and has no time to do the thinking and writing work compounding the issues.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:25.500]   His most important work is to think so engineers can build the right thing, and he has no thinking
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.140]   time because of overhead and meeting happy colleagues.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.940]   He claims there's nothing he can offload and he can't cancel meetings because too much
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.500]   won't move forward, but I don't buy it.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.060]   All right, Sally, I don't buy it either.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.300]   I mean, here's what I do buy, and this is a common trap when people are dealing with
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.540]   overload and digital knowledge work.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.180]   The common trap is to say, "Can I take work in the way I have it unfolding right now and
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.180]   just start not doing the things that I'm not liking?
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.580]   Can I just start canceling meetings?"
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:04.180]   He's like, "Well, no, because these are projects that I'm supervising, and I have to supervise
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.180]   them, and they need meetings."
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.940]   Or he's like, "Can I radically reduce the projects?"
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.700]   Well, for a lot of people, that could be yes.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.700]   Using the system I talked about in the deep dive of today's episode, you could have active
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.220]   projects and waiting projects.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.220]   Managers can't always do that, though.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.340]   It's like, "No, these are the projects going on.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.940]   I'm in charge of them, but not in charge of deciding what we do, and so no, I can't offload
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.940]   projects."
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.940]   And then they throw up their hands.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.180]   But what they don't think about is, "Can I change the structure in which this work is
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.620]   actually happening?
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.040]   Not changing what I'm doing, but changing how I'm doing it."
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.860]   And here we often get significant failures of imagination.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.020]   So Sally, here's what I would tell your husband.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.020]   Here's what you're going to do.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.740]   Two and a half hours every afternoon, maybe three, there's going to be a 30 to 60-minute
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.380]   office hour block right there in your afternoon.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.380]   Your door is open.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.700]   You have Zooms or Teams turned on with a waiting room, and your phone is on.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:06.940]   The rest of this time, you have a Calendly, whatever type setup, 15-minute blocks, 15
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.020]   or 30-minute blocks, you choose which.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.700]   It's like 90 minutes to two hours of just boom, boom, boom.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.620]   You can go in there and grab any block you want.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.500]   Here now is how you deal with all of your teams.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.420]   Questions that just require an answer, and they can be answered in a single message.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.140]   "Hey, what is my budget for this again?
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.140]   What is my timeline for this again?
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.140]   When is it?
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.700]   Have you heard back yet about whatever?"
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.260]   Those can be emailed.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.260]   Great use for email.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.500]   They show up, they sit until your partner is ready to look at his emails, and he can
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.940]   send back answers and get the information to people.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940]   Minimal overhead.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   Great.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.780]   Things that require some back-and-forth.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.300]   Come to my next office hours.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.700]   We're never more than a few hours away from my office hours.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.180]   Drop by, jump on a Zoom waiting room, 10 minutes, let's pound it out.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.500]   Like, "What's going on here?
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.500]   What's holding you up?
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   How can I help you?
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   Hmm.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   Hmm.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.500]   Okay.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   This, this, this.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   Good.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   Let's go."
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   You have an issue that's more complicated than that.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   "No, we really need to think."
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.500]   Great.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   You don't even have to tell me.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   Just do it.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   What do I do in the afternoons?
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.740]   I just go to these meetings that are scheduled.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.980]   We'll rock and roll and have the longer discussions if you don't want to just jump into office.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.900]   So it's going to take more than five minutes.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.900]   Schedule one of those slots.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.900]   Guess what?
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:29.460]   This is going to handle 95% of what's happening in these meetings, and yet consolidate all
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:36.020]   of that to two to three hours a day, leaving your husband's entire mornings free, right?
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.540]   This could make a huge difference.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.860]   It's not changing what you do, managing products and talking to people about what they need
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.780]   for their projects, or it's not changing your workload even.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.660]   It's how you do your work.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.660]   It could make a huge difference.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:53.900]   Two, because he's in charge, he's a director here, demand better meetings too.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.900]   All right.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900]   You can come to the office hours.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.420]   You can grab one of these slots, but I'm going to use the Jeff Bezos or General George Marshall
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.660]   approach of here's what I expect if you were bringing me into a discussion that takes my
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.660]   time.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.740]   That you have done most of the work on your own to figure out what's going on, where's
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:21.380]   the sticking point, where do I need outside help, what specific help do I need, what's
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.820]   all the relevant information you need.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.780]   Jeff Bezos demands that you send him all of this in a two-page memo a certain amount of
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.060]   time before any meeting.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.100]   So the meeting can be like a laser beam.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.780]   This is exactly where we need your help.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.820]   You already are briefed.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.500]   You already know exactly why we're asking you and what you need.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   What's your decision?
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.020]   This cuts down the time required to meetings to be very short.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.460]   It also reduces the number of meetings because a lot of people use meetings as a way, as
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.580]   like a crew time management tool.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.260]   Like I don't really know what to do next.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.900]   I don't have a lot of control over my schedule or time.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   I don't really want to sit and think too much about it.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.420]   But what I can do is just get a meeting.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.740]   Now I put a meeting on the schedule.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.900]   I'm no longer stressed about this because I'm like when we get to the meeting, that's
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.980]   when the work will happen.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.500]   But if you're the product, the product director of product management rather, it's not your
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.460]   goal to do this work with people.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.000]   It's not your problem that people are uncomfortable with how am I going to remember to make progress
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.100]   on this project.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.460]   It's not your problem that the way they want to work is just put calendar things on and
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.520]   then get the work done in the calendar things.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.980]   You demand I need that memo.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.940]   So maybe now what you do is like, okay, before you come to office hours or schedule one of
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.740]   these things, like maybe office hours you can drop by, but these are five minute discussions.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.060]   If you want to schedule one of these 30 minute meeting blocks, as part of that scheduling
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.140]   form, you're pointing me towards a shared document that has the full briefing.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.380]   And these are the exactly what we need your decision on.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.380]   Here's all the information.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.380]   Do I have all the information?
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.340]   Here's all the information you need to make this decision.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.500]   Here's what needs to be discussed in the meeting.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.740]   And those meetings become more efficient.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.740]   I'm telling you, 95% of your interaction can now happen in two and a half to three hours
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.460]   a day.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.080]   Imagine now what that's going to open up for your partner in terms of the thinking he can
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.620]   do, the strategy, the leadership he can do.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.540]   It also frees up a lot of time for the meetings that won't fit in there.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.340]   When the CEO is like, we need you to come to the strategy session, when the big client
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.380]   presentations in town, now you have the breathing room to do those things because your day is
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.700]   not with these haphazard meetings that are longer than they need to be and too haphazardly
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   scheduled.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.700]   All right.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.540]   So point him towards me, Sally.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.580]   I think his life could be a lot better.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.340]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
