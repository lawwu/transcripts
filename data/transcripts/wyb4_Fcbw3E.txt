[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.160]   Pastor John, recently you have been
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.560]   thinking about Andrew Jackson and giving some fresh thought
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.520]   to slavery in American history.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.280]   What would you like to share with us here?
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.360]   We visited the hermitage, it's called,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.960]   outside Nashville, the estate of Andrew Jackson,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.600]   the seventh president of the United States.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.960]   He was president from 1829 to 1837.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.240]   And the reason this is troubling to me,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.000]   and I wanted to talk about it, is
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.680]   because I was confronted there head on, again,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.420]   with the bothersome foundations of our country,
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.120]   the troubling ones.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.880]   I watched this 20-minute video of Jackson's life
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.560]   and presidency, and then I read the plaques in the museum,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.900]   and then I strolled through all the grounds
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.120]   and gardens of the mansion and the slave quarters.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.280]   And the heavy realization came again
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.360]   that our country is built in significant part
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.440]   on the soil of stolen land and the backs of stolen men.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.960]   That's the phrase I came away with.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.040]   Land taken from Native Americans and cultivated
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.560]   with African-American slaves.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.800]   Andrew Jackson was a great war hero
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.920]   in his battles against the Creek Indians in 1814
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.720]   and the British, especially at the Battle of New Orleans
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.400]   in 1815.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.980]   He was incredibly popular among Southern whites,
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.440]   and he was a wealthy slave owner.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.480]   And the whole slave system of how his estate was profitable
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.600]   is evident from the archaeological work that's
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   preserved there at the Hermitage.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.400]   You can walk, and they have the outlines of the slave quarters
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.240]   and the buildings where the overseer lived.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.040]   And one or two places are actually
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.760]   preserved, the little cottages where the slaves lived
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.120]   are preserved, and you can see the way they lived.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.800]   Jackson was, in addition, the main force
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   behind the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.360]   And that meant the forcible removal
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.200]   of the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the Choctaw, the Creek,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   the Seminole Indians from southeastern states
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.440]   like North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.160]   All of them pressed across the Mississippi over to Oklahoma
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   in what became known as the Trail of Tears.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.440]   And it's pretty bleak to read about how much disease there
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.860]   was, how much death there was, how much displacement there
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.960]   was of people who didn't want to leave their homelands
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.720]   but were forced to.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   And what that did was open the land
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.000]   to be settled by white settlers so they could be prosperous.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.040]   That's where I grew up.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.800]   I grew up on the back of that prosperity in South Carolina.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.880]   So I've been pondering, what effect should that
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.160]   have on me, a 21st century, prosperous, happy, well-to-do,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.480]   comfortable American?
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.680]   It raises huge questions.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.880]   It forces me to think about how the sins the fathers are
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.600]   visited on the later generations and how that relates
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   to the doctrine of original sin.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.000]   Deuteronomy 24, 16 says, "Fathers shall not
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.520]   be put to death because of their children,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.080]   and children put to death not because of their fathers.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.320]   Each one shall be put to death for his own sin."
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.920]   So there's a difference in the biblical mind
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.480]   between the way Adam was the head of the human race
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.160]   so that we fell in Adam, we sinned in Adam,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.960]   we died in Adam, and the way we relate
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.600]   to the sins of our fathers and our grandfathers.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.360]   Seems like God has established, in the beginning,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.680]   a kind of union with Adam and all humans,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.960]   but not in such a way that all sons fall in all fathers.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   We fell in Adam, but I didn't feel
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.280]   and fall in Bill Piper in the same way.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.080]   There was a covenantal constitutional union
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.560]   God established there.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.760]   And when Exodus 25 speaks of visiting
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.520]   the sins of the fathers on the sons,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   it says, "Visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.680]   on the children to the third and fourth generation of those
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.920]   who hate me."
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.280]   In other words, the father's sins
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.800]   are not visited on innocent children, children who--
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.560]   they share the same rebellion that the fathers had,
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.640]   and therein consists some of the visitation.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.760]   So how should I feel?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.800]   Those are some of the reflections
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.280]   on how Andrew Jackson's sins relate to my life today.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.320]   And here's my conclusion, Tony, and I really
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.960]   feel very much in process in this,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.280]   trying to discern what the appropriate attitude should be
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.520]   and action should be.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.080]   So I've got two ways that I think we should respond.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.640]   Number one, I think we should feel a chastened gratitude
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.560]   for our prosperity in America.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.520]   That is, I was born here.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.120]   I had nothing to do with being born here.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.920]   I enjoy hundreds of benefits for being an American just
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.640]   because I was born here in the skin I have.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.400]   At the time I was born, in the place I was born,
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.560]   to the parents I was born, I had nothing
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.760]   to do with any of that, and yet I benefit from it.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.920]   And so I must feel gratitude.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.680]   It's a gift.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.880]   And yet it should be, I think, a chastened gratitude.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.720]   And what I mean by that is I should realize and be humbled
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.840]   by the fact that I am prospering from the sins
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.960]   of national forefathers.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.440]   I may not be guilty of their guilt,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.480]   but I do benefit from the country
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.160]   they built on their guilt. I am sobered and chastened
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   and humbled by that.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.200]   That's my first response.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.840]   My second one is I think we should feel shame.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.800]   I've been thinking about shame.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.600]   Why does a person feel shame for somebody else's behavior?
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   And the answer is, well, we only do
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.920]   if there's some kind of attachment to us,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.680]   like if they're our kids.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.480]   If they're our kids who are misbehaving,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.640]   we feel more shame than if they're
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.360]   your kids who are misbehaving.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   But there are other kinds of attachments besides family.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.360]   There's school attachments, like if a high school had a brawl
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.960]   and beat up on some minority at a ball game,
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.200]   I'd feel ashamed of my school, right?
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.240]   Or there's religious attachments.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.880]   When Christians act ugly towards Muslims or something,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.960]   we feel ashamed because I'm a Christian,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.760]   and Christians shouldn't act like that.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   And there are racial and all kinds of attachments
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.520]   that we can feel shame because the people that we're like
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.040]   have behaved in a certain way, or the people
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.600]   that we're attached to.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.320]   And so I think that's fitting.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.040]   I think that's a godly, proper thing
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.480]   to feel some measure of shame.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.920]   And I think what we do with that shame,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.280]   then, is we remedy it, we lay it down,
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.400]   we overcome it in an appropriate way
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.360]   by expressing sorrow for the act that we're ashamed of.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   I'm sorry that that happened to the Indian people.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.000]   Number two, that we renounce it as something we disapprove of.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.320]   And thirdly, we resolve to do whatever
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.000]   is appropriate to make right what we can.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.080]   So those are my two things, Tony, two efforts
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.160]   to figure out how John Piper's heart and his behavior
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.360]   should respond in view of my brief visit
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   to the hermitage in Nashville a few days ago.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.920]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.160]   for listening to this podcast.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   As many of you know, Billy Graham
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.080]   has been in the news of late.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.240]   And you, Pastor John, have some interesting stories
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.600]   to share about Graham, which we'll dive into next week.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.240]   And stay tuned for that.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.040]   Until then, please continue to flood the email inbox
