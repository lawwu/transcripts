[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:22.400]   the first epistle of Peter, in the first chapter, in verses 3, 4, and 5.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.120]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.240]   mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:46.080]   the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.640]   in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.800]   to be revealed in the last time.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.040]   Now there you see in that mighty and magnificent benediction, in doxology almost, the apostle
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:17.640]   Peter bursts forth at the very beginning of his letter. After the briefest of salutations,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:27.240]   he suddenly, I say, breaks forth in these thrilling and mighty words. Now in doing this,
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.720]   the apostle, of course, was not doing anything unique. He was doing what all the early Christians
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:43.080]   did. He was doing what all the writers of these New Testament epistles invariably do.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.760]   The moment they begin to mention the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.800]   in this way, I say, burst forth into some great description of praise to him. Take the
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.880]   apostle Paul, for instance, in writing to the Ephesians. Again in the third verse he
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.800]   does the same thing, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.320]   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ," etc., etc. And
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.720]   he goes on until the end of the fourteenth verse in that great epistle.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.120]   Now this then is obviously the great characteristic of the true Christian. It is the great characteristic
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.040]   note of the New Testament. As I say, it was the characteristic note of the early Church.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.080]   The early Church was a Church characterized by praise, characterized by a sense of joy.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.240]   "Blessed be the God and Father." That was their note. And as I say, you get it even
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.680]   at the very beginning.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.560]   Now this is something that was not confined to the early Church. If you read the long
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   history and story of the Christian Church, you will find that this has been characteristic
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:11.040]   of the Church always, in every period of revival. At any period of reformation and renewal,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.880]   this original note has come back. And the Church has literally been thrilling with a
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.240]   sense of praise and of joy.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.280]   You see, an apostle like this, as I am indicating, cannot take up his pen and write, and write
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.840]   even to people who are suffering a good deal of trial and tribulation, as he wrote to them.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.520]   He cannot do so without starting in this mighty and magnificent manner.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.840]   Very well, let us as Christian people ask ourselves the obvious question before we go
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:53.200]   any further. Is this the characteristic of our Christian life and witness? Is this what
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:04.800]   we feel? Is this our response to the Gospel? Is this, I ask, our actual experience in this
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:13.840]   modern world, and in spite of everything that is so true round and about us?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.920]   Now that, I feel, is the most important thing for us to say to ourselves this morning. We
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   claim to be Christians, we make our profession of faith. But in the last analysis, this is
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:34.800]   the test of it all. Is there that spirit within us which was in this apostle and in the people
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.200]   to whom he wrote? He is able to say of them, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.000]   for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through many full temptations." He later
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.280]   says of them, "Whom having not seen ye love, in whom, though now ye see him not yet
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:02.000]   believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory." He says that about ordinary
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.600]   Christian people like ourselves. He knew that that was true of them.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.480]   And therefore, I say, the most important question for us to face is just that. Here we meet
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.000]   together on Easter morning, claiming to believe this great fact of the resurrection of the
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Son of God. But the question is, what is our response to it? What is our feeling? What
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.960]   is our reaction to this great message which we claim to believe?
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.760]   Now if we can say that we are like the apostle, and that contemplating it all, we have got
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:48.080]   nothing to say but, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," well,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.200]   if that is our position, the words that we are going to consider will confirm us in that
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.600]   and strengthen us and add to it and increase it. But if we cannot say that honestly, well,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:08.000]   I say, let us pay heed to what the apostle tells us. Because here he, fortunately, as
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.040]   is the custom of all these writers, let us into the secret of why he felt that himself,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   why he must always burst forth in this great praise and worship and adoration and thanksgiving.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.800]   Well now then, let us follow him. Let us meditate with him upon this great fact.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.840]   What he tells us, in essence, is this. There is a great fundamental principle here, and
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:47.440]   that is that the resurrection is vital and central to the whole position of the Christian.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.720]   You see, you notice his argument. "Blessed," he says, "be the God and Father of our Lord
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again to a lively hope."
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:07.240]   But how has he done it? "By, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.800]   That is the centre, that is the foundation, that is the thing which makes it all possible
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.480]   and brings it all to us. So we see that our controlling principle is that there is no
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:31.160]   Christianity apart from the resurrection. It is vital, it is absolutely essential. This
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.560]   apostle could never have written like that were it not for the resurrection. If you doubt
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.200]   that, read the beginning of the twenty-first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.560]   where you see these apostles, Peter amongst them, after the death and crucifixion and
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.000]   burial of our Lord, utterly downcast, quite disconsolate, miserable, unhappy, so much
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.640]   so that Peter, turning to the others, said, "I go a fishing," felt he must do something
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:06.040]   to relieve the tension and the misery and the unhappiness. And what was it that transformed
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.520]   him into the man that was able to say, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.840]   that hath begotten us again unto a living hope." Well, it was this, the resurrection.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.880]   Very well, I say, this is something which is basic and foundational. And if a man does
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.640]   not believe in the resurrection, whatever else he may be, he has no right to call himself
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.120]   a Christian. The great message that was preached by the apostles, as you will find in the book
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.960]   of the Acts of the Apostles, was this, Jesus and the resurrection. They would never have
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:52.560]   preached at all but for that. This was their theme, Jesus and the resurrection. Very well.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:00.680]   Well now then, what is it that the resurrection does? Why is it so foundational and so central?
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.120]   Let me try to divide up what the apostle says for your consideration. The first thing he
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:13.640]   says is this, "It gives us a lively hope." "We've been begotten again," he says, "to
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.600]   a lively hope." Now, a better translation here is to say, "a living hope." Of course,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.840]   if it's living, it's lively. A thing which is dead doesn't move, it's lifeless. But if
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.600]   there's life, there's liveliness. A lively hope, a living hope. Why do you think he troubles
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.880]   to describe it in that way? Well, I think there can be no doubt about this at all. He
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:49.600]   is contrasting it to something which is vague and shadowy and uncertain and merely general.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:58.720]   Now, there is so much that passes for the Christian hope today, which at once is exposed
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:06.800]   as counterfeit when you test it by this adjective, "living," "lively." What is the message of
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.600]   this Easter morning? Is it just some vague message to say that spring has come again
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.800]   and after the death of winter there are signs of life, something vague and general belonging
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:28.440]   to nature? Is that the resurrection hope? There are many who say it is, and that that
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.960]   is all this day has got to say to us. But there's always a turn, that you always go
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:42.080]   around the circle and come back to the spring. So we must never despair. That, they say,
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.480]   is the message of Easter, something vague, nebulous, as indefinite as that. That's not
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:58.280]   what Peter's talking about, but begottenness again to a living hope, something substantial,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   something certain, something that is vibrant with life and with power. And of course, that
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:13.800]   is essential for this reason. He says the great thing about this hope is that it enables
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.840]   us to live. Peter, as I've already reminded you, was writing this letter to a number of
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.680]   people who were experiencing a very, very hard time. "Though now, for a season, if
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.600]   need be, ye are in heaviness through many full temptations." It's the great theme
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.120]   of this first epistle of Peter. You'll find that he mentions it in every single chapter.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.360]   In the second chapter he says, "Look, you're having a hard time, but understand this,"
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:49.560]   he says, "you're simply following in his steps. Who did no wrong, who was without guile,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.920]   when he suffered, he threatened not." He's got it in the third chapter. He mentions the
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:03.400]   times of Noah and the few godly remnant people that were left in that godless age. He mentions
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:09.560]   it again in the fourth chapter. He says, "Don't be amazed and surprised at this fiery trial
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.800]   that is trying you and that's going to try you more. Don't be surprised." And then
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.680]   he ends off in his last chapter, in his doxology, by saying that after he has suffered a while.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.800]   Well, now then, in other words, you see, the New Testament is very practical. This isn't
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:32.040]   a sort of fairy tale. This isn't the optimism of the novelist. This isn't the cheeriness
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.440]   that is affected by the statesmen and the politicians. No, no, this is realism. This
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.120]   doesn't minimize problems and difficulties and trials. Its whole purpose is to show this,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.360]   that whatever they are, however bad they may be, however dark and cruel and ugly, it doesn't
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:57.880]   matter. We've got a living hope that can hold us, that can sustain us, that can enable us
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.600]   not only to endure, but to be more than conquerors. That's the note of the New Testament. We can
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   look at it all and smile in the face of it. Paul says it, same thing in Romans 8. We,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.920]   he says, are actually being led daily as sheep to the slaughter. Everything's against us.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:21.160]   It doesn't matter, he says. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.440]   him that loved us. That's the living hope. It's a hope, I say, that not only enables
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.620]   a man to go through the very worst that hell can produce against him, it can enable him
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:43.960]   to do so with a sense of joy, with a sense of triumph, with a sense of assurance. That's
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   what the apostle's saying, that's his message. He says we've been begotten again into a lively,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.240]   a living hope. Well now then, how is it that the resurrection
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:03.940]   does this? I do trust we're examining ourselves as I go on from point to point. Have you got
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:10.020]   this sense within you that you're more than conqueror? What's your attitude to your circumstances
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:18.820]   this morning? In your personal life, in your married and home life, in your business, your
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.380]   profession, the group to which you belong, the whole world as it is this morning, what's
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:32.420]   your reaction to it? Does this great fact of the resurrection give you a sense of certainty,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:41.020]   of triumph, of assurance, and of joy? Are you rejoicing in your tribulations? Are you
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:47.660]   lifted up above them? Are you able to say, looking at them all, "Blessed be the God and
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:55.300]   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." He does this, says the apostle, he gives us this living,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:01.700]   lively hope through the resurrection. Well, very well then, here is the important
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:10.220]   matter for us. What does he mean by this? How does the resurrection give those who believe
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:16.540]   in it truly this living, lively hope? And here it seems to me that we must divide our
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:23.820]   answer into two sections. The resurrection does this, in the first instance, because
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:34.460]   of what it did to the Lord Jesus Christ himself. This is done to us by the resurrection of
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:42.700]   Jesus Christ from the dead. So, there's the starting point. And that is what I meant by
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:49.180]   emphasizing at the beginning, that the whole basis of the Christian faith is that the resurrection
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:57.340]   of the Lord Jesus Christ is a literal fact. What I mean by a literal fact is this, that
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.380]   the apostle was referring, not to the fact that the Lord Jesus, who had been crucified
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:10.900]   on the Friday, was still alive in the spirit realm. That isn't what he means at all. What
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:17.260]   he is referring to is that he literally came out of the grave, that he came out of the
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:23.180]   grave in the body, that the body which had been crucified on the Friday and which had
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.460]   been taken down when he died and put into that sepulchre had left the sepulchre. The
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:34.020]   empty grave is at the basis of all this. Now, I am emphasizing this, of course, for
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:41.980]   this good reason. You probably have been reading, as I have been reading, in various newspapers,
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.820]   articles on the resurrection and on Easter and so on, and you will have found probably
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:52.820]   that nearly all of them refer to the fact that it means just survival. And of course,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:59.860]   it means nothing of the sort. We are not here to merely celebrate survival of personality.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.380]   That is not the message of Easter Day that was believed in before Easter. It is believed
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.820]   in by many today who are not Christians at all. No, no, the specific message of the Christian
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:18.940]   faith is this, that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who was crucified and who died and
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:30.140]   was buried, was raised from the dead in the body. That he came out, complete personality,
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.620]   body, as well as everything else, out of that grave which was left empty. Hence you see
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.780]   the details which you observed in that twentieth chapter of John's Gospel as there in the
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:46.500]   others. Oh, they are careful to note that the napkin around the head was in a different
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.540]   position from the other grave clothes, just to give you details, to show you that this
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:58.260]   is literal historical fact, giving as minute a report as that, good enough to satisfy any
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:04.260]   detective that wants to investigate. The evidence for this great fact is as definite and as
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.900]   certain as any fact in the whole long history of the human race. Very well, then, it tells
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:18.380]   us that he was raised from the dead by the power of the Father. What does that mean?
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.020]   Well, now, looking at it in the light of the whole movement of salvation, what it means
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:29.820]   is this, and this is the Christian and the New Testament way of looking at it. Here is
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:38.100]   the eternal Son of God, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity. Having been from
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:46.260]   eternity in the bosom of the Father, having spent his eternal existence in that ineffable
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:55.660]   glory, at a given point he enters into time, what for? Well, for men and his salvation.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:03.660]   What did he do? Well, he took into himself human nature. He entered into this world and
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:11.900]   into the realm of sin and of death. He was, says the apostle Paul, made of a woman, made
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:19.540]   under the law. You see, you cannot understand these things except theologically. It means
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:28.300]   this, that he who was entirely glorious and divine became man also. The Word was made
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:36.540]   flesh. And in doing that, he was not only made of a woman, but he was made under the
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:43.620]   law. He came into this sinful world as a man amongst men. He did not cease to be God, but
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:50.060]   he became man in addition, complete man. He had a human body, such as you and I have,
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.860]   with the infirmities. No element of sin, but the infirmities were there. And they are shown,
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.620]   as you read the accounts of his life, in the pages of the four Gospels. And he was subject
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.660]   to temptation. As God, he could not be tempted, but as men, he not only could be tempted,
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:11.540]   he was tempted. Now then, he came into this world and thus, he identified himself with
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:20.260]   us. But you remember, it went even further. As men, I say, he was subject to temptations,
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:28.260]   tempted in all points, like as we are, yet without sin. All the opposition of the devil
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:35.340]   and his followers, all the malignity of hell was turned upon him. He came down in order
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:44.020]   to do that, and he passed through all that. These enemies of God, these infernal powers,
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.500]   were determined to destroy him because they knew that he was the Son of God. You will
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:56.060]   find in the Gospels that devils recognizing him and begging of him to leave them alone.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.740]   Well here they were, all masked against him and determined to destroy him and the whole
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:12.220]   purpose of God connected with him. And finally, we see it coming to this, that not only were
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:20.340]   all these powers set against him, we see something still more amazing and extraordinary. We see
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:29.860]   him being led to the cross and there being nailed upon it. What is really happening there?
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.260]   Well what is happening there, according to the Scriptures, is that God, as Peter puts
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:42.100]   it in his second chapter here, was laying on him our sins. "Who bear our sins," he
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:48.700]   says, "in his own body on the tree? God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:55.020]   sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." What does it mean? Well
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:03.180]   it means this. He was born, I say, made under the law. And there on the cross on Calvary's
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:12.140]   hill all that the law has got to say against sin was said. All the punishment that the
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:19.700]   law meets out upon sin and guilt and evil and shame was poured out upon him. That is
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:25.820]   what was happening there. The law, the righteous demands of the law of God were being fulfilled.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:35.340]   They were all poured out upon him. That is what he was doing. And it led to his death.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:42.660]   It was the cause of his death. Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. And
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:49.500]   so he died. And his body was taken down and buried in the grave. Then comes this great
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.860]   and momentous fact. This is the thing, this is Peter, that thrills me and grips me and
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:04.700]   moves me and makes me cry out in worship and in adoration. He did not remain in the grave.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:12.740]   He was brought out of it, unscathed, conquering, appearing to his chosen followers, ascending
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:18.780]   into heaven, taking down his seat again in the everlasting glory.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.860]   Now that is the first and the most important thing for us to grasp. What does it mean?
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.180]   Well, let us listen to the Apostle Paul's exposition of it in the sixth chapter of the
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:33.260]   epistle to the Romans. He puts it like this. "Knowing," he says, "that Christ, being
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:39.580]   raised from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him. For in that
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:45.660]   he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God." Now, do
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.700]   you get the significance of death? That is the heart of the gospel. What it means is
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:59.260]   this. Once. In that he died, he died unto sin once. Death, he says, hath no more dominion
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:05.580]   over him. It did have at one point. You see, this is the whole marvel and miracle of the
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:12.380]   incarnation and all that the Son of God did and was done to him. He subjected himself
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.100]   to all that the law has got to say about sin, made of a woman, made under the law. He is
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.900]   under the law, not that he had ever sinned, not that he was sinful, but it is identification
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:28.220]   with us. He has taken his place by our side. He submitted to baptism for that reason. "Suffer
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.180]   it to be so now," he says. He is one with us. He has come about our sins. So he is under
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:43.940]   the law, and the law condemns, and it condemned him. "For us, for our sin, he died unto sin
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:53.300]   once." He died once, but no more. You see, the resurrection is a great announcement of
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:25:01.820]   this, that he has finished the work he came to do. He is no longer under the law. He is
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.100]   back in glory. Why? Well, he has done everything that the law could demand. The law has exhausted
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.300]   itself upon him. He will die no more. He need not have died at all. He deliberately came
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.860]   into the realm of sin and of death in this life in order to deliver us from it. But he
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.220]   has finished with it. He is up the other side. He came from glory. He came down under the
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.500]   law into the realm of sin and of death. He has finished it. He is up the other side.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:35.380]   He dieth no more. Death hath no more dominion over him. That is the meaning of the resurrection.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:43.020]   He has gone back into that realm outside sin and law and death. He is back in the eternal
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:53.500]   realm of glory. That is the meaning of the resurrection. He has conquered the realm of
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:26:01.500]   law and of sin and of death. He has vanquished them. He has gone right through them. He is
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.180]   up, I say, the other side and has returned to the glory whence he came.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:13.300]   Well now, there is the first thing. But listen. What the apostle is saying is this, that you
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:18.860]   and I have this lively hope, partly because that happened to him, yes, but still more
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:27.060]   because of what happened to us. What happened to us? What do you mean, says someone? Well,
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:31.780]   listen to the apostle's word. "Blessed," he says, "be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:43.020]   Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope."
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.340]   You notice, begotten us again. What does that mean? Well, he uses exactly the same word
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:54.380]   in the 23rd verse of this chapter where he says, "Being born again, not of corruptible
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.860]   seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever." Hath begotten
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:06.660]   us again. We have been born again unto a living hope. That is the very term that he uses.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:14.900]   What does it mean? Well, it means this. The truth about a Christian is not simply that
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:21.100]   he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ and that he believes that Christ was risen from the
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.540]   dead. Oh yes, of course he believes that, and you can't be a Christian without believing
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:31.300]   that, I repeat. But you know, that isn't the whole truth about the Christian. The Christian
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:39.820]   is a man who has been regenerated unto a living hope, born again unto a living hope. What
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:48.180]   does this mean? Well, of course, regeneration means new life. We've been born again unto
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.220]   a living hope. You'll never have this hope until you're born again. The natural man hasn't
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:58.300]   got it. He is without hope in the world. Without hope, without God, without Christ, in the
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.380]   world. The only man who's got this living hope, the only man who can smile in the face
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:11.020]   of death, is the man who's been regenerated, born again, begotten again.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:17.500]   Well how does it happen, says someone? The answer is, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:24.540]   from the dead. We are regenerated, born again, through, by, through the agency, the medium
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:31.860]   of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. How does that do it, says someone? Well,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:38.540]   you know, this is to me the most remarkable of all the Christian doctrines. It is the
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:48.620]   doctrine of our union with Christ. We are one with him, and what happened to him, happened
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:56.500]   to us. Let Paul again expound in Romans 6, "Shall
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.940]   we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid," he says, "how shall we that die
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:10.820]   to sin live any longer therein?" Then listen, "Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:19.060]   into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:24.980]   into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:30.460]   even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:36.100]   in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection."
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.180]   And then he goes on, "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:46.980]   with him, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, deatheth no more
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.220]   dominion over him. Likewise reckon ye yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:58.260]   unto God through Jesus Christ." It is the thing he says everywhere. "If ye then be
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:11.500]   risen with Christ, your life is hid with Christ in God." Listen to it in Ephesians 2, "Ye
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:20.900]   were he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin, but God who is rich in mercy, even
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:27.300]   while we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ and hath raised us
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:33.340]   up together with him and hath caused us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:41.620]   Do you see how it all happens as the result of the resurrection? This is how a man gets
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:48.820]   the living hope. It is because he is joined to Christ, he is in this blessed state of
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:58.780]   union with Christ. So that what happened to the Lord Jesus Christ happened to him also.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:06.860]   Christ and his people are one. He is the head, we are the body. And when he died, we died.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:12.660]   He was buried in our grave, we were buried with him. When he rose, we rose. So that the
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:20.020]   apostle says that as he is dead to the law and dead to sin and dead to death, so are
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:29.660]   we. A Christian is a man who can say, "I am dead to sin, I am dead to the law, I am
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:38.100]   dead to death." Death has no dominion over a Christian. He simply falls asleep. He has
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:44.700]   already passed through what death really means. He will never taste death. Christ has tasted
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:51.780]   it for him. He is alive with Christ in a new life. He has been begotten again, regenerated
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:58.460]   unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. That is how it
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:04.460]   happens. What does it lead to? Well, he says the hope to which it leads is this. It is
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:10.860]   this living hope. What is the living hope? Well, he says it is an inheritance which is
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.260]   incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, which is reserved in heaven for
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:21.940]   us. What is the hope of the Christian this morning? My dear friend, it is not merely
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:29.900]   survival. There are foolish people who are saying that this is but survival. I remind
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:36.980]   you again that survival of the dead was believed in before Christ ever came into this world.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:42.380]   You need not fall back upon the phenomena of spiritualism to believe in the resurrection.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:50.300]   If you do, you are denying the resurrection. This was not some mere spirit appearance.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:56.860]   This was the body that had been crucified itself being glorified and rising and appearing
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:05.340]   before the people. The message of Easter morning is not survival. That is not it at all. It
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.620]   is this hope to which it brings us. It is not that we shall go on living when we die.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:15.300]   No, no, it is something infinitely beyond that. What is it? Well, it is essentially
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:27.340]   this, the resurrection of the body. Our spirits, as we have seen, are already resurrected.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:33.740]   We have been begotten again, regenerated, born anew. A man who is a Christian is a man
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:39.100]   who is already renewed in spirit. Yes, but here we are told that he shall be renewed
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:47.900]   in body also. What does it mean? It means this. We shall enter into this inheritance
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:54.620]   as the apostle, and we shall enter into it as complete personalities. When the Christian
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.860]   dies, he does not go to some vague shadowy realm, some kind of Elysium. Do not believe
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:06.140]   in the so-called teaching of that old Greek mythology, the river Styx and so on. No, no,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:13.820]   forget all that and all the nonsense of spiritism. This is real, this is complete personality,
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:20.460]   not a spirit floating in some vague atmosphere, but the complete man, body, soul, and spirit
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:26.540]   renewed and glorified and entering into his everlasting inheritance. That is the thing
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:35.060]   we have been begotten unto, to an inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled and that
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:43.940]   fadeth not away, reserved in heaven by God for us, who are kept by the power of God through
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.660]   faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. What is all this? Well,
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:35:03.980]   it means this. God made this world perfect, paradise, put men in it, and man was perfect.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:11.980]   And you know God is not going to be satisfied until all that has been restored. I do not
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:18.060]   spend Easter Sunday morning in protesting against bombs. My dear friends, I have got a message
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:29.320]   infinitely higher. This old world is doomed. It is a sinful world, it is an evil world,
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:35.460]   and it can never be made a good world by men. He can protest, he can march, he can pass
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:44.020]   his acts of parliament. He will never do it. Sin is in himself. When he was put in paradise,
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:52.580]   he turned it into a place of shame. Oh, no, men can never put this world right. But thank
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:58.300]   God, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ that hath begotten us again
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:04.020]   unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. And to what will?
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:14.620]   I know this this morning, that this old world is going to be renewed. The Lord Jesus Christ
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:20.820]   said, "When the regeneration shall take place, when the Son of Man returns again,"
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.860]   read about it in Matthew 19, the regeneration that is going to take place in the cosmos.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:33.060]   When? Oh, when this Lord Jesus Christ comes back again. That is the message. He has triumphed
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.740]   over all these enemies. He has risen. He is seated at the right hand of God. What is he
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.220]   doing? Waiting until his enemies shall all be made his footstool. Then he will come back
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:49.660]   again as the King of kings and as the Lord of lords. He will destroy out of existence
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:56.540]   all that is evil and sinful and vile and ugly and foul. He will renew the whole creation
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:03.140]   and he will bring in his glorious kingdom. The city of God, the new, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:10.740]   will descend and God will make his tabernacle amongst men. And this is what it means to
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:19.300]   us, you know, that if we are Christian, that you and I shall be there, not as floating
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:26.580]   vague spirits in a shadowy existence, no, no, in this body glorified, delivered from
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:33.100]   all vestiges of illness, weakness, sin and shame. This body I will be identified as myself.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:39.060]   I will be in a glorified body. We are waiting, says Paul to the Philippians, for the return
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:44.700]   of this Son of God. Our citizenship is in heaven. We are looking for his coming again.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:52.100]   Who shall change this vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body?
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.260]   According to the working of that mighty power whereby he is able to subdue even all things
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.140]   unto himself. That is what it means. That is the inheritance. It is coming and I am
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:10.880]   going into that and I know it now. I have been born again unto this hope. By the resurrection
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:21.300]   of Jesus Christ from the dead, oh, the blessedness of this knowledge. You and I are in an old
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   world that may be blown to nothing at any moment. Does that depress you? Is that the
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.020]   thing that is monopolizing all your thought? Is that the one thing to be talking about
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:42.360]   always? If so, I do not hesitate to assert you are not a Christian.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:50.000]   The Christian has got his eye on another land. He sees this old world after that regeneration
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.440]   when the Son of God shall come. And what does he see about it? It is incorruptible. It will
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:06.400]   be undefiled. It will never fade away. Nothing from outside will be able to affect this.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:14.200]   Incorruptible. The devil and all his cohorts and powers will have been cast into the lake
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:21.960]   of destruction, whatever that may mean, and they will be helpless. There will be nothing
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:30.760]   evil or sinful in itself. It is undefiled. And it will never fade away. It will go on
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:39.280]   forever and forever and forever. Everlasting glory. That is the hope. That is the inheritance.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:45.760]   That is the thing which I have been born again unto. That is the thing that sustains me.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.960]   So I look out upon this evil, sinful world this morning. It does not depress me. I expect
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   nothing better from it. Whatever may be going against me, whatever may be happening in my
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:03.920]   own body, I know I must expect this. Sin has led to all this. But though I die and I shall
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:15.640]   die, I shall rise again and I shall see him face to face. I shall see him as he is, and
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:23.560]   blessed I shall be like him, in a glorified body with everything renewed. And I shall
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:32.640]   be living in a realm which is incorruptible and undefiled, and that can never fade away.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.360]   Christian people, that is the hope of the resurrection. That is the message of this
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:43.640]   Easter morning. And you see, it is absolutely safe. The resurrection itself guarantees it
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:50.160]   all. Every enemy has been destroyed. Christ has conquered every one of them. What he means
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.680]   is the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in his second chapter. You are saying that
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.440]   God made men and that he put everything under him. But we see not everything put under him.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.560]   I agree, says that man. And then he answers, but we see Jesus.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:15.640]   "For the suffering of death was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:22.600]   and honor." And he is our forerunner. He has gone to prepare a place for us. And he
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   will come again and receive us unto himself, and he will usher us into his own glorious
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:33.520]   kingdom. We shall reign with him as kings and priests. We shall judge the world. We
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:39.360]   shall judge angels. It is guaranteed. Nothing can stop it. Can death stop it? Of course
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:45.040]   not. He has conquered it. Can the devil? No, he has vanquished. Can hell? No, no. O death,
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? He has vanquished, he has conquered
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:02.600]   every enemy. And his resurrection pronounces that. He has risen triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:10.720]   Nor life, nor death, nor hell, nor anything else could defeat him. He is the King of kings,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.440]   and he is the Lord of lords.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:26.800]   Christian people, have you got this living hope? Is your eye set upon that inheritance
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:35.920]   that he has purchased for you? Is there something within you at this moment that is crying out
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   however feebly, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that hath begotten
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:50.600]   us again out of the hopelessness and the despair and the failure and the sin and the shame
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:59.560]   and the disease and the death and the hell of this life, unto an inheritance which is
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:09.440]   incorruptible and undefiled, and that will never fade away, which is reserved for us
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:16.160]   by God, the same God who even keeps us, gives us power, strength, ability to endure and
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:30.240]   to triumph in spite of everything. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.440]   Amen.
