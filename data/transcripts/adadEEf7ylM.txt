[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760]   - Welcome to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.760]   This week we are joined by guest Ted Tripp,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.400]   probably best known for his two best-selling parenting books,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580]   Shepherding a Child's Heart and Instructing a Child's Heart.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.160]   Dr. Tripp, thank you for joining us this week.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.480]   We have a big week ahead, so let's get right into it
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.440]   and let's start big picture.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.260]   Parenting is hard and demanding work,
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.920]   and I think every parent would agree with that,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.560]   but are the aims and goals of parenthood
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.440]   really all that complicated?
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.160]   In other words, do Christian parents seem to
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.140]   oversimplify parenting or make it too complex?
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.360]   What do you say?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.320]   - Well, I think that, as you said,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.140]   parenting is hard work and it requires time and focus
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.960]   and intentionality, but I don't think that necessarily
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.120]   has to be terribly complicated either.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.680]   You know, one of the problems we have, I think,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.760]   in modern culture is that people want to have children,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.320]   but they don't necessarily want to be parents.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.960]   You know, we almost view children sometimes as possessions.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.360]   You know, I've got these kids, aren't they cute?
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.280]   Especially when they're real young, you know,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.160]   and everyone oohs and ahs over your children.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.840]   But the calling of being a parent is really
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.240]   a full-time focus.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240]   It's got to be one of the primary things
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.760]   that you're involved in when you're raising children.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.020]   So I think, Tony, that knowing God,
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.400]   modeling God's ways for our children
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.400]   is really the big picture idea, you know,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.960]   that I'm a Christian.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.240]   I love God, and I want to draw my children
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   into that whole spiritual world of this wonderful God
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.760]   and love for him and delight in him,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.640]   helping them to see and embrace the goodness of God's ways
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.000]   and the richness of God's truth.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.920]   That's where I want to be going with my kids all the time.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   So, and I think, you know, in the simplest terms,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   kind of the overview that I want parents to take away
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   from my work on parenting is that the goal
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.980]   is not just managing behavior.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.720]   The goal is really shepherding the heart.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.960]   The goal is to nurture, so that my responsibility
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040]   as a parent is not just to control, to constrain,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.360]   to limit the range of choices, to manage this kid
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.760]   so that he jumps in my hoops and does the things
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520]   that I would like him to do.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.800]   'Cause I think a lot of parents end up
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.240]   with no more profound focus than that,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.360]   even Christian parents.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.720]   But I want to be shepherding his heart.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.440]   I want him to understand that the heart
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.520]   is the wellspring of life.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.640]   It's Proverbs 4:23.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.320]   Above all else, guard your heart,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   for it's the wellspring of life.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.960]   All the choices and desires and purposes
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.520]   of the person are bound up inside.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.360]   And, you know, we make choices and make decisions
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.400]   based on what is attractive and important to us.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.800]   You know, all the way through raising kids,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.960]   that's what I want to do.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.400]   Now, the way you do it is gonna be very different
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.120]   with a two-year-old than with a teenager.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.760]   I mean, a two-year-old's not gonna be self-conscious
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.440]   about motivation.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.280]   I can't ask him about his heart.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.640]   He doesn't even understand.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.860]   He lacks the vocabulary, the insight, the understanding,
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.000]   the facility with ideas to even interact
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.760]   with that question.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.600]   So, you know, you begin with kids talking about the heart
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.000]   even when you do correction.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.920]   I mean, so a little child, you know,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.960]   knocks over his sister and takes her toy.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.640]   I want to correct that behavior.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.280]   Honey, no, no, you may not do that.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.720]   Your sister was playing with that.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.440]   We're gonna give that back to her.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.760]   When I correct her or correct him,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.940]   I'm going to use the language of the heart
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.240]   to describe the thing.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.280]   So, honey, you're not being kind to your sister.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.320]   You're loving yourself.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   You're not loving her.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.520]   You're serving yourself.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.880]   You're not serving her.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   You must give the toy back to your sister.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.800]   She was playing with it.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.600]   That's a way that you can express love for her.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   So that I'm, even in my correction of this two-year-old,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.200]   I'm talking about things other than just,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.560]   give her back that toy, that's bad.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.400]   Don't be bad.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.080]   You know, be nice to your sister.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.720]   Well, those terms don't have any meaning.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.040]   There's no content to them.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.280]   So I'm gonna give content to that
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.440]   by talking about the heart.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.040]   Then with older kids, obviously,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.160]   you can talk about heart issues much more thoroughly
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.600]   and even teach them through their middle years
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.240]   about attitudes of heart and the way that behavior
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.720]   is pushed and pulled by what goes on inside.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.040]   - Yes, so parenting is really, by God's grace,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.360]   aimed at raising faith-filled Christians.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.800]   Can you boil it down like that?
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.840]   - Sure, I think that, yeah, I want to raise kids
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.080]   that understand the world of reality.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   There's a God in heaven.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.920]   He's glorious, he's good,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.880]   and I want them to see his goodness.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.720]   - Yeah, so good.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.760]   Thank you, Dr. Tripp.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.400]   And parenting expert Ted Tripp will be with us all week.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.120]   He is the author of two best-selling books,
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.420]   Shepherding a Child's Heart and Instructing a Child's Heart.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.800]   So what is the single greatest threat
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.480]   to the Christian family?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.560]   I'll ask Dr. Tripp that question tomorrow.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.400]   We'll see you then.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.560]   (upbeat music)
