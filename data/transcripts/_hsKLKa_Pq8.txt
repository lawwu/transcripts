[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380]   I first learned about methylene blue from owning fish tanks.
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.280]   You clean fish tanks with them, or it's a thing you use.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.780]   Now there's a lot of interest in methylene blue
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.920]   ever since a video of Robert Kennedy putting methylene blue
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.400]   in his water on a plane kind of went viral.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.480]   Methylene blue has been around a very long time.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.700]   What are your thoughts on it?
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.620]   What does it do?
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.540]   Is it going to help mitochondria?
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.780]   Is it for everybody?
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.880]   I don't take it.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.780]   I don't take it either,
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.840]   and I've not used it in any patients so far,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.080]   but I'm very interested in possibly starting to use it
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.280]   in controlled ways in patients who clearly need something more.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.960]   We're doing all of the right things.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.380]   We're doing the lifestyle things.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.640]   We're doing ketogenic interventions or other things,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   and they still are not well.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.380]   There's still room for improvement.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.120]   So methylene blue, as you said, has been around for a long time.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.520]   It's relatively cheap as a fish tank cleaner.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:19.340]   Methylene blue, fascinatingly, is primarily exclusively a mitochondrial agent.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.380]   So it is an electron acceptor and donor.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100]   So that is what methylene blue does.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.720]   It can accept electrons, and it can donate electrons.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.580]   So it's an electron shuttle, if you will.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.880]   And how does that relate to mitochondria?
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.980]   Mitochondria, as they are producing ATP, electrons are flowing down the electron transport chain,
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.520]   and that is what results in the production of ATP.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.480]   If it gets shuttled through the uncoupling protein, it results in heat production.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.340]   And when electrons flow out of that system, when they leak out of that system,
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.660]   it creates reactive oxygen species, which, again, are very harmful to both mitochondria and cells.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:21.340]   So if you have dysfunctional mitochondria that don't seem to be able to contain the electrons appropriately,
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.140]   electrons are leaking out.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.420]   So these would be mitochondria that are producing more reactive oxygen species than they should.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.720]   Does that ever happen in biology?
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.400]   One hundred percent.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.220]   We've got decades of evidence that aging, neurodegeneration, even obesity, type 2 diabetes,
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.480]   and a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with that process.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.440]   The increased levels of reactive oxygen species, often referred to as oxidative stress.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.800]   So we've got decades of evidence strongly supporting that.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.820]   Can methylene blue play a role in that?
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.140]   Absolutely, because methylene blue can come in and take some of these wayward electrons
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:20.840]   and prevent them from creating reactive oxygen species, which might help calm things down.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.960]   One of the challenges with methylene blue, as we discussed before,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.560]   you can have too little and too much, same with methylene blue.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.640]   You can have too little and too much.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.500]   You don't want to accept too many electrons.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.840]   These electrons need to be flowing to the places they should be flowing.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.380]   As opposed to oxidative stress, the polar opposite of that is called reductive stress.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.380]   And that too has been found in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and some other disorders.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.520]   So it's really about dysregulated kind of balance between oxidative and reductive stress.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.960]   And methylene blue, if you take it in overdose, could become a reductive stressor.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.920]   So you don't want too much.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.280]   But, so we do have pilot trials.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:28.700]   Again, small, not super well done pilot trials in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.700]   Depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, others.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.020]   Many of them suggesting a benefit.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.660]   Do you know what the dose range is?
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.000]   I don't.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.500]   I don't either.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.960]   I don't know off the top of my head.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.020]   Yeah, because I, because methylene blue, as I understand, has some MAO activity.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.320]   The, can adjust some of the enzymes that in turn adjust levels of serotonin.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.160]   Which is why I haven't taken it.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.000]   I've just been cautious about, I don't really want to boost my serotonin.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.180]   There's this recent study out of a lab at Stanford showing that the rewarding properties of various
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.640]   things, as we know, increase dopamine in anticipation of a reward, but also important, it seems.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.680]   These are mouse studies, but serotonin drops as dopamine goes up.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.420]   And that drop in serotonin is at least as important as the increase in dopamine for the reinforcing
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.700]   properties of certain behaviors and substances.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.960]   And I, I'm very reluctant to tamper with anything that would raise serotonin because in these
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:47.420]   studies or these experiments, or in these experiments, I should say, increasing serotonin offset some
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.160]   of the rewarding aspects of otherwise rewarding things.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.800]   So I want things that are rewarding to feel rewarding.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.780]   And so this, this difference between dopamine and serotonin seems pretty vital.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.180]   I mean, that's not to say I'm like terrified of anything that increases serotonin, but to
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.240]   do it pharmacologically, it just seems a little, a little sketchy, given I don't have a clinical
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.880]   need that I'm at least not that I'm aware of.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.860]   Well, and that's actually one of the warnings with methylene blue is that if you, if taken
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.780]   in to have a dose, you can actually get serotonin syndrome.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.840]   Could you explain what serotonin syndrome is?
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.380]   So serotonin syndrome is just like really excessive deluge of serotonin in the system.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.860]   more often than not, it's completely unrecognized.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.160]   Really?
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.680]   It gets mistaken for psychiatric symptoms.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.420]   So people can have anxiety.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.660]   They can have panic.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.780]   In extreme cases, you can get nausea.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.780]   You can get fevers.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.700]   You can get, I mean, in extreme cases, it can be fatal.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.140]   So it's a serious thing, but more often than not, it gets dismissed because serotonin syndrome
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.500]   is most commonly experienced by people taking SSRIs.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.280]   And by definition, they are psychiatric patients or they have a mental health condition.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.300]   And so when they come in and say, I'm feeling nauseous, I feel anxious, I feel jittery, I feel,
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.460]   I don't feel right.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.520]   They get written off more often than not.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.920]   Or given more medication, perhaps.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.400]   Yeah, let's increase your dose.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.640]   Let's increase your dose or whatever.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.780]   So it's actually really tragic.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:36.480]   I mean, one woman actually reached out to me who, after learning about my work, reading my book,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.780]   she talked to her psychiatrist, tapered off all her meds,
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.160]   and it became clear that she probably had serotonin syndrome for a long time.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.560]   Wow.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.180]   To both her and her psychiatrist.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.040]   So the meds were causing the problem.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.860]   And the meds were causing the problem, and nobody really recognized it.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.880]   Goodness gracious.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.740]   Again, so it's, so anyway, methylene blue can cause serotonin syndrome.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.580]   So I think if people are going to, if people want to consider using it,
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.960]   I would, number one, make sure you get a very reputable source of it.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.680]   Make sure you're consuming it in a way that makes sense.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.740]   I mean, it can stain your teeth blue and all sorts of stuff.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.260]   So make sure urine blue, your tongue blue.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.280]   But people will do IV infusions of methylene blue.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:31.660]   So yeah, no, that's, I've seen people kind of hooked up to IVs with a bag of methylene blue.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.760]   Do they turn blue?
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.580]   And they, I hope not.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.060]   Smurf, smurfing.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.380]   But it is a medically approved treatment.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.580]   And I think it can be done in safe ways.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.160]   Again, it's off patent.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.200]   Nobody's going to stand to make any money off of doing large,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.920]   well-designed trials of methylene blue.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.960]   But I'm really interested in it as this, as it has these properties.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.400]   In addition to just being this electron acceptor and donor,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.880]   there's some evidence that it may improve mitochondrial biogenesis,
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.140]   that it has anti-inflammatory effects,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.320]   and that it can do other things that may be beneficial.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:29.740]   And I think it's a very special.
