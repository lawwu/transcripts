[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.440]   - Pastor John, in 2009 you wrote an article titled
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.020]   Why and How I am Tweeting.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.140]   Four years later, speak to us about your Twitter philosophy
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.020]   and your activities.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.300]   What are you aiming to accomplish on Twitter?
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.620]   How do you use the medium?
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.780]   - Yeah, I have been thinking about uses of Twitter,
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.220]   largely because I use it and I don't want to use it
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.260]   in a way that dishonors the Lord.
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.540]   So I'll just ramble for a minute here
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.620]   about what I've been thinking.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.260]   I think everybody who's got a Twitter name
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.900]   and uses it should think and pray through why they use it.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.620]   God is a planning God, He's a purposeful God
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.180]   and He calls us to do things purposefully.
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020]   Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink,
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.860]   do all to the glory of God.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.320]   So we're supposed to have a God-centered purpose
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.660]   in all that we do, whether we're playing softball
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.220]   like some of you guys do, or whether we're writing a tweet,
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.620]   or whether we're preaching a sermon,
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.980]   or we're changing the diaper, or making a meal.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.920]   The Bible really gets down dirty
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.100]   to the specifics of our lives and says, think it through.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.540]   Why are you doing this?
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.340]   And then let the why govern the how.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.780]   Ephesians 4, 29, "Let no corrupting talk
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.460]   "come out of your mouths,
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.340]   "but only such as is good for up-building."
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.340]   So is my tweet gonna build?
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.060]   Is it gonna fit the occasion?
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.360]   Is it gonna minister grace to those who hear?
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.380]   Then I think one of the biggest things I deal with
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.020]   is asking, all right, beware, Piper,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.980]   of the love of the praise and attention of people.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.040]   How often are you checking your followers?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.060]   Beware, Jesus said, beware of practicing your righteousness
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180]   before other people be seen by them.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.520]   There's this deep, fallen, human craving
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.480]   to be seen, to be known, to be liked, to be praised.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.400]   Oh, Jesus had strong words for that.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.560]   Beware of the scribes who walk around with long robes
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.080]   and long greetings in the marketplaces
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.320]   and all the best seats at the synagogues,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.960]   places of honor at feasts.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   Just beware.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.480]   They make long prayers to give a pretense.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.500]   Oh, Jesus hated that kind of thing,
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.200]   and so I wanna hate it in me mainly.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.600]   I don't wanna go around looking for other people.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.960]   I got enough problems right here in the mirror
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.880]   with John Piper's love affair with attention,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   so that's a huge warning.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.480]   And here's a very practical thing God did for me recently.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   I'm pondering ending my ministry at Bethlehem
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.560]   as a pastor and thinking about what it's like,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.400]   and I thought one of the texts I might use
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.760]   when I get to say five minutes worth of thank you
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.800]   at a service that's coming here.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.360]   John the Baptist said, "The friend of the bridegroom
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.780]   "who stands to hear him rejoices greatly
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.880]   "at the bridegroom's voice.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.160]   "Therefore, this joy of mine is now complete.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.880]   "He must increase, I must decrease."
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   And I just want that to fly as a banner over every tweet.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.640]   Jesus up, Piper down.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.640]   But I'll tell you, that is really, really tricky
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.240]   because what it does is it makes all of us
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.880]   distinguish between self-promotion and truth-promotion,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.600]   self-promotion and Christ-promotion.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   How subtle this is.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720]   I mean, here's a very concrete thing
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   I don't like to read in tweets.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.600]   It goes something like this.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.040]   "Humbled to be invited by the most famous person
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.340]   "in the world to their super important event."
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.880]   Using humble language to cloak a tribute
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.520]   that you have just received,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.760]   I just see this all over Twitter, all over Twitter.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.560]   Everybody feels self-conscious about saying something
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.680]   that somebody said about them, and yet I see it everywhere.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.600]   People retweeting commendations of themselves or their work.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.040]   I just, there's something inside of me
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.920]   that just twists about that.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   And yet, and yet I know that I point people
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.080]   in my tweets to things I have listened.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   Now, I've got at that moment to say,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.400]   "Now, am I doing this because what I really love
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.340]   "is getting lots of attention, lots of followers,
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.920]   "or do I love the truth of what I've written there
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.400]   "so much that's why I wrote it, that's why I posted,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   "and that's why I want my followers to read it,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.960]   "who read the tweets?"
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   So those are tough distinctions
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.020]   that I think we really, really have to make them.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.400]   Here's another caution.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.680]   Beware, this is maybe more to blogs than tweets,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.360]   but beware of scolding someone in public
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.840]   which might be more productive in person.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.960]   Here's a way I think about it.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.840]   If you're at a conference speaking,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.880]   and you set, use your imagination here,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.600]   you got 5,000, 10,000 people at this conference,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.500]   and you're listening to the speaker just in front of you,
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.520]   and he says something amiss.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.160]   Now, it may be, maybe, that in your talk following him,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.480]   you should publicly dress him down.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.640]   I doubt it.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.040]   Probably you should go to him behind the stage,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.600]   and say, "Did you mean to say what I thought you said?"
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.000]   And then give him your issue.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.240]   Tweeting is like having an audience of thousands of people,
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.600]   or hundreds, depending on where you are,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.040]   and as soon as you say something,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.400]   you're saying it to another person
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.620]   in front of thousands of people.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.460]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.320]   and thank you for modeling this very point.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.560]   Next time, we'll circle back around
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.000]   to talk more about Twitter and Facebook,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.040]   but for now, thank you for listening to this podcast.
