[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.520]   - You have children, I now have children.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400]   You've spent a lot of time thinking about money
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.280]   at a level and purpose and identity
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.920]   at a level that I haven't yet.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.480]   And I certainly haven't for my kids,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.160]   two months, two years old, maybe it's too early.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.320]   But given what you've thought
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.040]   and for any parents listening,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.640]   what advice do you have for taking some of these lessons,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.920]   whether they're purpose-driven,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.640]   whether they're financial-driven,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480]   and teaching them to children as parents?
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.680]   - Get it together yourself,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.120]   and then model that behavior and your kids will follow suit.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520]   I think we often talk about
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.840]   what exercises we should do with our children,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.280]   what we specifically should teach them didactically,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.600]   what we should get them involved in.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.040]   I'm thoroughly convinced
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.000]   that the way your kids actually learn
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.920]   is watching how you navigate the world.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.840]   So it sounds a little funny,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.560]   but I think that we as adults
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.320]   should concentrate on ourselves,
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.960]   develop these great, meaningful habits,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.760]   and live them out in front of our children so they can see.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.720]   And I think that, more than anything else,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   will give them a good handle
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.720]   on what living a purposeful life, a full life looks like.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.400]   - I'll add a caveat to what you said,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.160]   which is for some of these lessons,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.480]   just doing them only works
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.080]   if you also expose your children to it.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.160]   So from a financial standpoint,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.200]   I might be organized and thoughtful
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.920]   about my personal finances,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.480]   and maybe at two years old and two months old,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.280]   it's not the time, but at some point,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   I can't just live that,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.960]   I also have to bring the family into it.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440]   So whether that's talking about what you're doing,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.000]   making sure that you're not just doing it,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.840]   but you're also sharing that you're doing it,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.160]   for some of these things matters.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.040]   Maybe for doing a job you're fulfilled,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.120]   people will kind of get that through osmosis
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.440]   with you in the house.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.040]   But I do think that when it comes to finances,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.240]   some of the things that I want to do in the future,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.760]   or at least just not make them taboo topics
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.880]   that we don't talk about as a family.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   - Yeah, and I think also part of that modeling good behavior
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.240]   to go the next step forward and be a little more explicit,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.840]   is also giving them the space
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.880]   to then try those techniques and fail safely, right?
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.240]   So in our household, one way we did that
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.640]   is our kids could watch
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.400]   how we dealt with things financially,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000]   but then we started giving them a yearly allowance,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.520]   which we gave to them the first of the year.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.800]   We clearly stated what they were responsible for
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.040]   and what we were responsible for.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.120]   And then they had to decide what to do
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.360]   with that allowance the whole year.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   They weren't getting any more from us.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.040]   And so that was a way we'd been modeling
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.160]   for years good behavior,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.440]   but then we could actually set up a controlled experiment
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.960]   where the truth of the matter was,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.680]   there was no real risk for them,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240]   but they could then experiment,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.760]   try some of those things,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.400]   those techniques that we had been modeling,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640]   see what worked for them, see that hadn't,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.040]   make some mistakes, have a little egg on their face
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.800]   when they did something wrong, and then learn.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.760]   So I think that's part of that modeling
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.440]   is then to give them some space.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.160]   - And how did the allowance
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   for the year upfront experiment go?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   - You know, in some ways it did some unexpected things,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.920]   but then at least we could address it.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.440]   So for instance, my daughter,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.680]   we found became ultra scared of spending
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.720]   and always had way more left at the end of the year
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.280]   than she probably should have.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   My son, on the other hand,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.880]   was confident everything would work
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120]   and often spent too much in the beginning.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.680]   And then a catastrophe would hit
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.040]   and he'd find that he didn't have enough money.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.600]   A perfect example is, you know, he spent most of his money.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.640]   He had just a little bit left
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.040]   and he had about three or four months left,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.760]   and then he dropped his phone into a lake
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.960]   when we were paddle boarding.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.680]   And so all of a sudden he's like, I have zero money.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.120]   I can't buy a used phone, I can't do anything,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.440]   but I didn't foresee this coming
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.240]   'cause I thought I was doing a good job,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.600]   but I didn't see that something unexpected might happen.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.520]   So, you know, it plays out differently with different kids,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   but the idea then is then they can, you know,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.920]   to have those gentle conversations.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.880]   With my daughter, it might be, hmm, you know, it's great.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.240]   You had a lot of money left over,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.600]   your bank account's really growing,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.520]   but are you enjoying that money, right?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.320]   And then for my son, it might be like,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   yeah, money's a powerful tool,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   but if you're not careful and a good steward of it,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.000]   you may find you don't have it when you need it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.760]   And so those are different conversations you can have,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.600]   but it all starts with the modeling,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.400]   then kind of those simple experiments,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.800]   and then the talking to him.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.320]   - So did you loan your son money
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.880]   against his future year of allowance,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.400]   or how do you handle that one?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.760]   - The darn problem with my son
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.360]   is he's so goddarn innovative that I think he,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.120]   here's a perfect example.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.200]   My son is known as the electronics guy on the neighborhood,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.040]   so people give him old or broken electronics.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.360]   The other day, someone gave him an old or broken phone,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.080]   and he realized it was still under warranty,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.520]   sent it back to an Apple, and they sent him a new phone.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.920]   - Okay, so he figured it out himself.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.200]   - So he's a pretty savvy guy.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.400]   He figures out either how to fix most things
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.080]   or to find his way into something new.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.920]   The problem with this phone
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.320]   is it ended up at the bottom of the, above the lake.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.520]   He couldn't get it back.
