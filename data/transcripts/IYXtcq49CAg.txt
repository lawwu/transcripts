[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.860]   As our friend the Reverend Brian DuPont has just indicated, I stand before you tonight
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.640]   primarily as the chairman of the sponsoring committee that has been responsible for this
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.040]   meeting in which we are inaugurating the London Theological Seminary.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.120]   And before I say anything else, I should like to repeat what he said, namely our sense of
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.840]   gratitude to Mr. Kensett and the trustees of the Kensett Memorial College in whose premises
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.360]   we are meeting tonight and in whose premises the college, the seminary, is going to function.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.920]   I do want to pay this tribute to them for their courtesy and for their kindness, their
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.800]   readiness to accommodate us in every way and to facilitate the object which the sponsoring
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040]   committee had in mind.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.200]   They of course are concerned about the very same things as we are concerned and it seems
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.920]   to me to be a very happy coming together of two institutions which are designed and intended
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.320]   to further this same common object.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.720]   I say that I stand before you primarily as the chairman of the sponsoring committee,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.920]   but I have a suspicion that what is in the mind of many of you as you look at me standing
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.280]   here on this occasion is that the phenomenon by which you are confronted is that of a poacher
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.400]   turned gamekeeper.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.920]   And I think there is a good deal to be said for that feeling which many of you may be
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.240]   harboring in your minds.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:11.800]   However, I am here because I try always to be open to the conviction produced by facts
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.080]   and whatever views I may have held in the past and indeed still hold, I'm here because
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   I have been persuaded by the arguments that have been put before me.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.080]   Now I believe we are doing something here tonight which is of very great significance.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.440]   We are inaugurating a new college and we are concerned about the whole question of the
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   training for the ministry.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   And I want to take advantage of this occasion to reconsider with you the whole question
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.320]   of the training for the ministry.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.240]   That seems to me to be the most significant element in what we are doing here together
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   tonight.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.520]   Why should it be reconsidered?
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.180]   Well, there are many reasons for this and these are the reasons that have been moving
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.760]   us as members of this sponsoring committee.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.880]   I believe that by now everybody virtually is dissatisfied with the existing systems.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.400]   Within the last few months and very largely as the result of that atrocity known as the
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:44.640]   myth of God incarnate, many have been expressing their amazement and surprise at the state
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   of the colleges.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.400]   I've seen statements by bishops of the Church of England deploring the obvious gap between
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.120]   what is happening amongst so-called theologians in Oxford and Cambridge and the ordinary members
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   of the Christian Church.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.800]   Many of them have said, and said rightly, that these colleges where men are supposed
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.080]   to be trained for the Christian ministry have lost all contact with the members of the Christian
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.620]   Church.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.080]   This I think is something that is being recognized more and more, that something has to be done
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.440]   and we are aware of this.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.960]   Now there are some, of course, who have reacted against the present state of such colleges
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.160]   and have tended to say that therefore we don't need any colleges at all.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.780]   I think that that is an error as I'm hoping to show you as we proceed.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.380]   But there is that point of view and there is another which is of concern to all of us,
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.980]   I'm sure, at the present time.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.860]   There is a new stress upon experience and upon the experimental aspect of the Christian
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.620]   faith and we thank God for this, but many such friends again are tending to say that
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.580]   there is no need even for ministers and therefore no need for training ministers.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.860]   So we've got to bear that in mind.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.700]   We've got to preserve a balance.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.220]   A further reason for the coming into being of this college is that there are rumors and
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.340]   more than rumors of a move to have ecumenical colleges.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.980]   So far the various denominations have had their own colleges.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.780]   There is a move afoot now to amalgamate all these and to have colleges in which men were
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:56.220]   going to minister in the various denominations, even including the Roman Catholic Church,
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.180]   were going to be trained together and have a common course of instruction.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:12.380]   Now this you see immediately fires us with the feeling that we must have an evangelical
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   college.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.140]   I believe this ecumenical idea is going to come to pass, partly on economic grounds and
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.260]   various other difficulties.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.940]   They can't afford their separate colleges so they're all going to get together and they
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.340]   will be ecumenical colleges.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.980]   Now what we felt very strongly is this, that over and against that we must have an evangelical
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.620]   seminary and not only evangelical, we are emphasizing Protestant.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:50.300]   We are living in days unfortunately when it's no longer sufficient to talk about being evangelical.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.620]   We must emphasize Protestant as well as evangelical and that is where we are in such sympathy
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.500]   with the Kenset Memorial College.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.900]   We stand not only against ecumenicity but very definitely and in particular against
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.180]   Roman Catholicism.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.780]   We are Protestants and this is a Protestant evangelical college.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.820]   There are evangelicals today who are ready and not only ready to fraternize but are fraternizing
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:28.980]   with Roman Catholics and are even considering with favor the possibility of eventually being
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.860]   one with the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:40.340]   So we are Protestant as well as evangelical over against a vague ecumenicity that ultimately
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.940]   includes Roman Catholicism.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:52.100]   Another element or factor if you like which has influenced us is this, that we have been
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:08:00.620]   hearing that certain free church students who are hoping to enter and some of them have
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:08.140]   entered free church ministries have actually been going to Anglican colleges for their
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.020]   training.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:17.180]   Evangelical as a nonconformist and free churchman, that is to me something which really rouses
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.380]   my ire and if I had no other reason for supporting this venture that alone would be sufficient
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.980]   for me.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.940]   And then on top of this it is generally agreed that the existing colleges for some reason
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:40.740]   or another, and I hope to deal with some of them, have failed to produce preachers.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:47.820]   This is the most alarming and the most regrettable aspect of our present church life, the paucity
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.420]   of preachers of the word.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.980]   We've got knowledgeable men but what is needed above everything else is preachers.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.940]   And many hold the view, and I think there's something to be said for it, that the existing
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.860]   colleges far from producing preachers have on the whole tended to kill preachers and
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.020]   that young men who have gone to college full of a zeal for preaching the word of God have
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:24.020]   come out tired, intellectually weary and have lost that first impulse which gave them the
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.220]   desire to become preachers of the word.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.300]   So these are some of the reasons and then the final one which I adduce is this.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.900]   We felt it was essential that the sponsorship of such a college should be as broad-based
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.900]   as possible.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.980]   There are among us certain empire builders that are always ready to start their own colleges
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.740]   and I think that's very regrettable.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:57.460]   We felt we must have a college which would be supported by and which would minister to
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:04.660]   the various groupings of Protestant evangelicals in this country today and that is represented
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:10.220]   in the members of the sponsoring committee who are here tonight and those who cannot
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   be here tonight.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.200]   The representation is wide and is broad.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.020]   This is not some personal venture, it's the coming together of Protestant evangelical
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.260]   groupings in this country to have a college which will serve all the various churches.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.540]   Well now then, how do we approach this whole matter?
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.180]   What are we doing?
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.180]   I was seriously tempted to deal with this subject entirely and only from the historical
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.660]   standpoint.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.700]   I think it's very interesting, the history of theological colleges and seminaries is
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.380]   a very fascinating one.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.460]   Let me give you a very hurried brief sort of bird's eye view of the history of this
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.460]   matter.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:03.460]   The church as we all know started on the day of Pentecost and the first preacher was the
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:10.820]   man who from the modern sense and modern standpoint had had no training at all, a fisherman, the
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:18.020]   apostle Peter, because he and the others had been with our Lord and they'd heard his preaching
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.020]   and his teaching.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:26.060]   But there was no formal teaching, there was no formal training to make them preachers.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.820]   Peter stood up and filled with the Holy Ghost, he preached.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:37.900]   And all those New Testament preachers with the exception of the apostle Paul were similar
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   men.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.540]   They could be described as ignorant and unlearned men, yet they were mighty preachers.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:51.100]   So at first you see that was the position, but gradually that changed.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.140]   As the result of the spread of the gospel in the Greek world and coming amongst the
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:05.100]   philosophers and so on, it was felt that a greater intellectual content was necessary,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.900]   that the gospel should be defended against the attacks that were made upon it, and that
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.980]   its superiority to every human philosophy should be made clear and manifest.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:22.580]   So slowly the whole idea of training men and preparing men came in and it developed very
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.540]   rapidly until when you come to the Middle Ages and later you have what is called a kind
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:35.780]   of scholasticism, when men going into the ministry were taught a mixture of philosophy
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.340]   and biblical teaching.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:43.960]   They were taught systems, dogma, the Roman Catholic dogma and so on, with the result
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.380]   that the gospel in a sense was entirely hidden out of sight.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.500]   Then came the Protestant Reformation.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.780]   Now the Protestant Reformation, while it clearly saw the error of the teaching of Rome and
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:09.780]   introduced true gospel teaching and preaching, while it corrected the doctrine, in my opinion
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.020]   did not deal with this further matter of training men for the ministry.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:22.060]   It tended to take that over, except that it gave them, of course, a different teaching.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.420]   But the method seems to me to have been very much the same.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.900]   I can understand it.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.140]   They felt that they'd got to answer the case of Rome and they've got to point out the dangers
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.540]   and so on to people.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:43.780]   The result was that speaking very generally, Luther, Calvin and all those great men perpetuated
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:49.740]   the kind of teaching and preparation which had already been in vogue.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.540]   The teaching was changed, but in a sense the method wasn't.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.540]   And so you go on.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:02.300]   And when you come to the Puritans, I believe that they in a sense went further than the
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.420]   Reformers in this matter.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:12.740]   But I would argue that on the whole, even they also didn't break free, as it were,
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:22.500]   from this older method, this older approach, which had been in vogue for so many centuries.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.400]   But it's when you come to the 18th century that I believe a great change took place and
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.020]   something of very great significance.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:38.240]   With the advent of the evangelical or Methodist awakening, a number of people came into being
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.020]   who were known as exhorters.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.620]   These were men who were converted under the powerful preaching of the Methodists, both
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.460]   Calvinist and Arminian Methodists, exactly the same in this respect.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.260]   Men were converted, some of them ordinary workmen.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.900]   But these men began in the class meetings and other places to display a gift of speech.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.580]   And slowly they were called upon to speak.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.940]   Now they were not trained at all, but they became exhorters.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.060]   See the old idea still persisted.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.620]   They didn't like calling them preachers.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:19.060]   They called them exhorters because they hadn't had training.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.820]   But these men were very powerful preachers, some of them exceptionally so.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.980]   And this persisted for some time.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.580]   But it's when you come to the last century, the 19th century, that something happened
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.340]   which I think we've got to examine very carefully.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:43.700]   As the 19th century proceeded, and it was felt that people had now become more educated
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:52.040]   and more learned, dissatisfaction was felt with these simple, unlettered, perhaps sometimes
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.820]   uncouth preachers.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:01.520]   And it was felt that you must have educated men in the pulpit.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:08.420]   So the whole move in the direction of theological colleges and seminaries was given a very great
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.420]   impetus.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:17.740]   And it developed very rapidly until you came to the full-blown idea of theological colleges
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.740]   and seminaries, which flourished at the latter half of the 19th century and has persisted
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.540]   more or less until today.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:33.680]   Then great emphasis has been placed upon training, upon knowledge and learning, a knowledge of
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:40.400]   philosophy, a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, a knowledge of classical Greek in order that
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.040]   you might interpret the Greek of the New Testament truly, and so on.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.560]   Now this became the pattern.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.820]   And so men were sent to such colleges to receive this great education and learning and culture.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.640]   And that is what we have inherited.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:10.180]   But my suggestion to you here tonight is this, that we've arrived at a point when all that
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:16.920]   is in the melting pot and has got to be reconsidered if we really do want to have an efficient
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.760]   training of men for the ministry.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.040]   I mustn't digress by pointing out how all that was done in the last century has more
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.400]   or less come to nothing.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.960]   It's almost gone complete circle.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.240]   Having emphasized for so long, as they did, that you must have a knowledge of classical
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.200]   Greek, it was then discovered that the Greek that was actually used was so-called Koine
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.920]   Greek, a much more common Greek, and that the classical Greek could even be misleading
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   in this respect.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.720]   And not only that, look at the attention they paid to the dates of the various books and
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.320]   the confidence with which they said that most of the books of the New Testament were not
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.360]   written until the end of the first century and many of them in the second century.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.960]   And the fuss and the bother and the time they give in their expositions, in their commentaries
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.320]   to this whole question in the introduction.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:19.040]   But by now, John Robinson of everybody has proved that most of these were written before
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   AD 70.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.360]   So all the fuss and the bother and all the weariness that has been called to endless
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.800]   generations of poor students who've had to grapple with this nonsense has all proved
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.600]   to be completely valueless and useless.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.640]   However, there is the position.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.240]   Well, now then, what are we to do?
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.400]   And this is the conclusion at which we as a sponsoring committee have arrived at.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.600]   That the whole question must be faced anew.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.160]   We must make a fresh start.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:58.280]   That we mustn't content ourselves with a mere modification of the present system and the
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.320]   present position.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.680]   That I believe has been the main cause of the various Bible colleges that have come
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.560]   into being and especially since the end of the last war.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.280]   They I think were established on the basis, and I was concerned about one or two of them.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:25.240]   They were established on this basis that what we needed to do was to safeguard the teaching.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.280]   But the method of training was never considered at all.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.520]   It was felt that it was sufficient if you could only guarantee that the teaching would
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.560]   be evangelical.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   But they made the fatal mistake, I think, of allowing the curriculum to be determined
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.400]   by the liberals.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:52.160]   Some of them even by secular universities like the London University.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:58.000]   Fancy allowing a secular university, which is what the London University is, to determine
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.480]   the curriculum and the syllabus that evangelical ministers, student ministers, are to study.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.760]   I think that was the fatal move.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:17.400]   And so we are reconsidering the matter from the very basis and foundation.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.560]   We are not concerned, therefore, merely to start another college.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.320]   That's not our idea.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.920]   We are concerned about starting an entirely different seminary, something which is based
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   not on the tradition that we've inherited, but which we feel is based rather upon our
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.340]   understanding of the New Testament picture.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:48.680]   We propose that an entirely new start should be made.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.080]   Very well then, let me ask a question.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:57.960]   What is needed if we are going to put an end to the system we've inherited?
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   We start with the question of what is needed.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.880]   And I've already answered the question.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.920]   The primary need is for preachers.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.960]   God has done his greatest work in this world, in the church, through preachers.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.640]   And never was there a greater need of preachers than there is today.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.400]   I'm emphasizing preachers rather than teachers.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.240]   This I think is a thing that needs to be emphasized.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.480]   What's the difference, you say, between a preacher and a teacher?
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:42.520]   Well, the teacher is a man who essentially imparts information, passes on knowledge.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.440]   And I'm arguing that there is less of a need of teachers today than perhaps there has ever
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   been.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.440]   Why?
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.160]   Because the general level of culture and of knowledge and of ability is higher than
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.920]   it has ever been.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.400]   Members of churches today and others have had a good education speaking generally.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:10.160]   They're able to read many translations of the scriptures which were not available before.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.800]   There are endless commentaries.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.840]   And there is literature in general on theology and various other subjects which is easily
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.020]   and cheaply available.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:30.080]   So my argument is that the need today is not so much to give people information that they
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.800]   can find in books for themselves.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.360]   It isn't so much teaching or lecturing.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.920]   Well, what then?
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.360]   Well, it's preaching.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360]   What's preaching?
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.480]   Well, preaching is proclamation.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:51.720]   It is the presentation of the whole great message.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.960]   It includes, of course, evangelism.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.640]   The preacher should be an evangelist.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.880]   We hope that as men and women become Christian, this will be observed by their friends and
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   fellow workers and that will attract such to come to the house of God to hear the preaching
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.080]   that has produced such people.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.920]   So the preacher has always got to be an evangelist.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.200]   And he's got to know how to bring people to conviction of sin and to faith in the Lord
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.880]   Jesus Christ as the Apostle Paul tells us that he always did.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.440]   He reminds the Ephesians that what he did amongst them was to tell them about the repentance
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.920]   that is toward God and the faith that is toward the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:47.560]   And we need men who are able to do this with great power and at the same time to build
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.680]   up the saints.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:57.880]   I've often put it like this, that the first business of the preacher is inspirational.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:04.560]   It's not merely to dole out information or lecture on the books of the Bible or lecture
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.000]   on doctrine.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.800]   That's not his business.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.660]   He can tell people where to read this.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.520]   He does it up to a point, of course.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.480]   But his supreme task is to inspire the people.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.960]   Here are people reading the Bible.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.640]   They don't see much in it.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.120]   The business of the preacher is to bring the Bible alive to them, to show them what's in
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:32.440]   it, to thrill them as they hear it from him and then as they read it for themselves.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.960]   He's to move people.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.360]   He's to remember that they've got hearts as well as heads and that unless people are moved
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.480]   by the preaching, well, their head knowledge may even be a danger to them.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.640]   We are to be live people, living witnesses, epistles of Christ.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.120]   And that is the business of the preacher.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.920]   He's not simply to give people knowledge and information.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.440]   He's to produce saints.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.620]   And these saints, as they mix with others, will be the means of convicting them and bringing
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.840]   them to the church.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:12.160]   So the supreme need is that of preachers, not mere teachers, still less lecturers.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.280]   But the man of God is also to be a pastor.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.680]   Because of the stresses of modern life in a very special way, the pastoral side is an
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.160]   increasingly important one.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.960]   Well, now then, there is the need.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.280]   That's what we are aiming at.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.720]   How do we do it?
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.800]   Let's start with our idea with respect to the students.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.560]   What are our desiderata with regard to the student?
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.980]   I think this is very important.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.320]   I think the wrong view has been held for many years.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.760]   The churches and ministers, let's admit it, we've been far too ready to lay hands suddenly
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   on any man.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.440]   If any man says vaguely he'd like to go into the ministry, we more or less encourage him.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   We are quite wrong.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.560]   We shouldn't do that.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.440]   This is a very serious and a very profound matter.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:15.680]   I assume that we are all agreed that the minister is not a professional man.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.160]   All men should go into the ministry as a profession.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.880]   What do we desiderate, therefore?
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.320]   Well, he must be a converted man.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.840]   He must be a man who is aware of new life in him.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.960]   But he must be a spiritually minded man also.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.800]   This is essential.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.160]   Spiritually minded.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.480]   He must have a sense of burden for the souls of men.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:50.720]   He must be aware of a call which he finds irresistible.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.760]   I've always said if a man can stay out of the ministry, let him stay out.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.520]   No man should go into the ministry if he can stay out.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.200]   The love of Christ constraineth me.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.440]   He must also be a humble man.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   This is very important.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.280]   We read the story of George Whitefield.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.880]   He felt that this task of the preacher, the minister, was so high and so sacred, he felt
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.200]   completely unworthy of it.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   And he had to be forced by many to go on with it.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.000]   His sense of unworthiness, that seems to have gone, doesn't it?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.320]   People rush into it.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   Now, now.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.120]   The man who is to be a preacher must be a man who is aware of a sense of awe.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.160]   He's a humble man because of the greatness of the task.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.520]   I needn't say anything about his character.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.560]   When I talk about character, I mean this.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.840]   The minister must not be a difficult man.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   I'm afraid I've known ministers who have been.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.200]   And their poor flock have had to accommodate themselves to the man, to the preacher.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.160]   This should never be the case.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:12.400]   I've prevented quite a number of men from entering the ministry because I felt that
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:20.160]   they were of such a temperament, such a psychological make-up, that they were awkward men.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.040]   And that anybody going to speak to them would be ill at ease in their presence, would have
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.840]   to put the minister at ease.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:32.100]   Now, a minister, a man who preaches or who does pastoral work, he must be of such a character
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:38.640]   such a type that the people don't have difficulty in approaching him.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.200]   So these are general matters, but there are certain special matters which we must insist
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   upon.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.400]   A preacher should be a man of personality.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.560]   Now that's a term that's abused at the present time, isn't it?
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.680]   They talk about television personalities, these grinning ninnies.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.240]   That isn't what I mean by personality.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:11.640]   I mean a man of strength, a man of strength, a man with an element of command about him.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.480]   He's going to stand in that position.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:22.000]   So a negative personality is surely a defect in a man who is going to be a preacher.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.840]   He must also be a man of ability, obviously.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.240]   If he's going to help others, he must be a man of ability.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.800]   He must know how to think.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.600]   He must know how to study.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.640]   But above all, he must know how to speak.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:45.360]   A man can be a very good man, he can be a very godly man, but if he can't speak except
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.800]   in a halting, stumbling manner, he has no business to be in a pulpit.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.680]   By definition, the preacher is a speaker.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.320]   He's a proclaimer.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.120]   He must have a gift of speech.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.600]   Now I've referred to the 18th century, and that was the thing, of course, that they detected.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.000]   In their class meetings, they would find that there were certain men who could pray more
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.240]   freely than others.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.600]   They could speak more freely, not only in giving their experience, but in giving their
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.960]   opinion upon a verse.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.080]   It was thus that they were discovered that they were preachers, and the people then would
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.360]   urge them to do this regularly.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.560]   They had a speaking ability.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:30.440]   This seems to have been forgotten almost entirely during the present century, and it's led to
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.840]   very woeful and sad results.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:42.080]   So this man must be able to speak, and then he must have the confidence of the church
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.000]   from which he comes.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.440]   This is very important, and we're very concerned about that in connection with this college.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.980]   This college is to be a church-based college.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:59.080]   We want everything that's done here to be closely in touch with the churches from which
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.560]   the students and the candidates come, and they are to remain in contact with them constantly,
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:12.740]   their minister, their deacons, elders, if they have that peculiarity, or any other offices
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.600]   that they may chance to have.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:21.360]   So that we are very insistent upon this, that men should have the confidence of their churches
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.680]   and should remain in contact with them.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   That's the student.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.480]   When you come to the tutors, I'm not going to stay with this.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.980]   I think we'll all agree about this.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:39.780]   It's inevitable in the light of what I've been saying about the student.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.760]   The tutors must not be academics primarily.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.920]   That's been the curse, I think.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.840]   Academics who know nothing about church life and who know nothing about handling people,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.040]   and most of them can't preach at all.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.480]   They are the men who have been teaching men how to be preachers and pastors.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.560]   It's idiotic.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:11.120]   We must have men who are themselves pastors and preachers, and not mere academics.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:17.520]   And the men that we have appointed as the tutors of this London Theological Seminary
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.720]   are men who conform to this pattern.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.440]   They are men, incidentally, who've been to either Oxford or Cambridge or London University,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.880]   and some of them have even been to two of them.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.400]   So they're men of learning.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.660]   They are men of academic knowledge and of academic standing.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.400]   But we have not appointed them for that reason.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:43.040]   We've appointed them because they're men who are preachers and who are concerned to preach,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.440]   because they're men with warm pastoral hearts, because they're men who are spiritually minded
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.040]   and are concerned about revival in the church.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.600]   Such are these members of the faculty who are on either side of me as I stand before
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.440]   you at this moment.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.240]   Now we've stood very strongly on that.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.880]   None of these men, not one of them, is leaving his church.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.800]   They're all continuing as ministers and pastors in their local churches, but they're giving
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:19.040]   their time, this extra time, taking on this extra task and labour in order to produce
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.720]   preachers and pastors for the future.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.240]   Very well.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.640]   Now then, we come, how are they to train these students?
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.520]   What is the character of this training about which we are concerned?
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.940]   I start by saying that it's unlike every other kind of training.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.120]   It is absolutely unique.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.880]   It is entirely different from going to study science or philosophy or literature or art
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.600]   or anything you like.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   Why?
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.880]   Well, because every Christian in a sense has the knowledge that the preacher and the pastor
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.680]   has.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.200]   It's a question of degree.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.640]   When you take up any other subject, you start by knowing nothing.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.560]   If you go to study medicine or science or any one of these, your personality as such
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.960]   is not involved.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.240]   But here, it is involved.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.380]   And every Christian is a man who has knowledge.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:24.280]   So that our entire approach has got to be very different.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:33.360]   We start by realising that here we are in a new realm, an entirely different realm.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.180]   It must never be considered in a sort of academic or scientific manner.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.800]   It must be considered always in a spiritual manner.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:48.880]   I came across a statement by Anselm, who was one time many centuries ago Archbishop of
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:53.280]   Canterbury, and he wrote a book, "Cordeus Homo."
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.680]   And he said this, and this is, I believe, what we must bear in mind.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.680]   This is the justification for any training at all.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:09.060]   Because on the one hand, right order requires that we believe the deep things of the Christian
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:16.340]   religion before presuming to subject them to the analysis and test of reason.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:25.980]   So, on the other hand, it looks to me like indolent neglect if, already established in
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:35.420]   the faith, we do not take the trouble to gain an intellectual intimacy with what we believe.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.940]   He says this, you see, you believe first.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.940]   Reason isn't there.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.940]   This is supra-reason.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.620]   It's above, beyond reason.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.020]   He says we must start with that.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.220]   That's where philosophy goes out.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.940]   But he says it is very unreasonable.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.460]   On the other hand, it's indolent neglect.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.460]   If we say, well, now, because I've got faith, I don't need to go any further.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:04.500]   You should, he says, you should now try to reason and to understand as far as you can
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:11.580]   with your enlightened spiritual reason the things that you have already believed in the
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.300]   realm above reason.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.940]   Well, now, that seems to me to be the basis from which we start.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:27.060]   But let's be clear, we are not interested in mere scholarship or a kind of scholasticism.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:32.820]   That's been, as I've said, the tragedy of the last hundred years in particular.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.260]   You know, these men have been concerned about theological education in the last century.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:44.380]   Remind me, more than anything else, of the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.380]   What was their characteristic?
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:50.740]   Well, as our Lord said to them, they tithe mint and rue and anise and come in and forget
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.180]   the weightier matters of the law.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:59.340]   Here are these foolish men, been wasting time and energy and wearing the poor students and
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:06.260]   in turn the members of congregations with mint and rue and anise and come in.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:14.340]   These odd details and the great principles of the Christian faith have fallen into disrepute.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:20.780]   They've been entirely forgotten and the result has been, as Mr. DuPont said, that some of
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.460]   these colleges have even closed and are going to be sold.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:29.540]   No, no, we are concerned about spiritual knowledge.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.860]   So that brings me to my next point.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.900]   I don't know whether you've read the brochure or not, but if you have, you will have discovered
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.900]   this.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.900]   There are to be no examinations in this college.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.260]   You see, we are departing entirely from what has been customary.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:51.780]   They with their wrong idea, they've had examinations, they've gone in for degrees and for diplomas.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.340]   We are not touching anything like that whatsoever.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.020]   We are turning our backs upon that.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.820]   The men who come here to be trained, they're not going to be regarded as children.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.820]   They're not under a law.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.500]   We're not going to tell them when they get up and when they go to bed and how they spend
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   their time.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:15.620]   We're assuming that they're men who are called of God and they feel a burden of the times.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.820]   And if they waste their time, well, so much for them.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.060]   There'll be disasters in the ministry if they ever get a church.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:30.420]   No, we are not interested in diplomas and degrees.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.340]   These do not belong to this realm.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:40.460]   To me, it's almost blasphemous that there should be examinations concerning this knowledge
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.680]   about which we are concerned.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:50.500]   And at this point, I venture to offer a criticism of a great evangelical scholar who at the
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:57.780]   opening of a famous seminary nearly 50 years ago, uttered these words.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:09.860]   He said that we desire, we believe, he says that a theological seminary is an institution
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:18.900]   of higher learning whose standards should not be inferior to the highest academic standards
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.540]   that anywhere prevail.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.060]   I dissent from that completely and entirely.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.860]   I think that's an entirely wrong approach.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:35.180]   This is not an academic institution and it should not be compared in any way with any
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.420]   other institution of higher learning.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.460]   We are in an entirely different realm here.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:50.180]   So I say we are not going to have any degrees or diplomas, not even any examinations.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:56.820]   The men will proclaim what they are and when they appear before churches, it'll be obvious
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.420]   what they are.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.020]   We start, in other words, on this assumption.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.180]   Preachers are born.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.940]   No college nor any other institution can ever produce a preacher.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.020]   That's been another of the fallacies.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.580]   A preacher is born.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.940]   I'm not sure that a pastor isn't also born.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.980]   However, they need to be helped.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   They need to be helped.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:28.660]   And it's because I've been persuaded that so many young men today, and incidentally,
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.060]   this being a theological seminary, there'll be no women here.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:38.540]   And the people will not be trained here for posts as religious teachers in schools.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.540]   We're not doing that.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:45.940]   We're out to produce preachers and pastors, not experts in religious education, not foreign
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.220]   missionaries as such.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.540]   Preachers and pastors.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.980]   They may go, of course, and preach in other countries, but we are not concerned, as most
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.900]   Bible colleges are, in that wider program.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:07.180]   We say, therefore, that these men, whom we've defined, need some further help.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.420]   What are we going to give them?
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:17.860]   Well, our idea is this, that we provide here, essentially and primarily, a basic teaching.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.580]   It's not a place to produce experts or specialists.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:32.300]   It's to produce men who are preaching Sunday by Sunday to congregations of people.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:40.220]   Now, if a man comes along, if a student appears, who has a greater aptitude than the average,
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.980]   and who feels he'd like to go somewhere else to get further knowledge or learning or instruction,
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.540]   he's at full liberty to do so.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:53.540]   But the object of this seminary is not to produce such men.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:01.220]   May I use, to deal with this point and to dismiss it, an analogy from the realm of medicine.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:07.820]   The great fallacy in medical training over a very long time now has been this, that instead
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:14.300]   of training men to be general practitioners, they've been training them to be specialists.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.860]   And here in the great London hospitals, where the teaching is done, and where you get all
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:24.100]   sorts of rare diseases and so on, the poor student, the qualified student, generally
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:31.020]   goes out, he knows a great deal about rare, exceptional diseases.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.860]   But he often feels that he knows very little about the common cold or some of the childish
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.920]   ailments which he'll have to deal with in his surgery day by day.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.580]   At last they've seen it.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.780]   The medical students are now given training by general practitioners.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.220]   But in the past it wasn't so.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:55.300]   And men had all this abstruse and rare knowledge, which was of no value in general practice.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:01.180]   Using the analogy, we are concerned here primarily about general practitioners, preachers of
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.460]   the word, regularly Sunday by Sunday in their churches and chapels.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.980]   If they want to go on, they're at full liberty to do so.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.300]   But this college in particular doesn't cater for that.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   Now then, what's going to be taught here?
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.920]   Well, the first thing, of course, is knowledge of the Bible.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.800]   Knowledge of the Bible.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.040]   Because the man is going to preach the Bible.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.140]   What does this involve?
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.460]   Well, we start with the vexed question of languages.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.980]   Hebrew and Greek.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:41.220]   And you may have observed from the brochure and the article written by Mr. Graham Harrison
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:48.420]   that we are only going to give them sufficient instruction on this matter to enable them
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:54.340]   to use their commentaries and so on in an intelligent manner.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.380]   Now I think this is a very important point.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.900]   I believe that a lot of the trouble in the past has been due to the fact that men have
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.940]   had to sweat and labor with Greek and Hebrew.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.780]   It hasn't been of much help to them when they've come out, because who are they to pit their
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.540]   opinions against the great authorities who write these other books?
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.040]   But they've had to sweat over it, and they've had to waste a lot of time, and they come
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.580]   out mentally and even physically sometimes exhausted.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:26.060]   But you know, there are statements being made at the present time, as they've been made
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.860]   before, which dispute this and deny this.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:37.780]   I heard of a youngish minister the other day saying in a conference that unless a man had
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:43.940]   a real thorough good knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, he couldn't be a preacher.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:49.580]   The same authority whom I've already quoted, who gave that address nearly 50 years ago,
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.580]   he said the same thing.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.820]   He put it like this.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:45:01.500]   He said, he was dismissing the philosophers, but he says, "But if you are to tell what
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:09.460]   the Bible does say, you must be able to read the Bible for yourself.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:16.220]   And you cannot read the Bible for yourself unless you know the languages in which it
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   was written."
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:23.340]   Now that to me is a very terrible statement to make.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:29.700]   You see, these men hold the view that unless a man has a knowledge of Hebrew and Greek,
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.620]   he cannot be a preacher of the Bible.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.620]   What's the answer to them?
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.980]   Well, I've already given one of them, the apostles.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.300]   They wouldn't come up to this standard.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:48.180]   And not only the apostles, the men I've referred to in the 18th century.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.260]   Some of the greatest preachers that the 18th century knew were not only men who didn't
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:58.340]   know any Greek or Hebrew, they'd never been to any school whatsoever.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.340]   Some of them had about three or six months in a school where they were taught a little
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.340]   English.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:10.220]   Now this is a very serious matter to me, quite apart from the fact that Spurgeon was never
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:15.380]   in a theological seminary, nor Joseph Parker, the two greatest English preachers of the
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:22.180]   last century, and many others who are well known because of their great preaching and
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.140]   their great works.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:30.180]   So to say that a man can't preach, can't even read his Bible, if he doesn't know Greek and
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:35.620]   Hebrew, I'm afraid I've got to dismiss it as being sheer nonsense.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.940]   But it's rather serious.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:43.940]   It seems to me that it shows an ignorance of the spiritual character of the biblical
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.620]   message.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:51.180]   I asked my friend Mr. Mingar to read 1 Corinthians chapter 2 at the beginning in order that this
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.580]   point might come out.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.140]   We are not in the realm of things natural.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:03.580]   These things are spiritually discerned and they're understood in a spiritual manner.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.420]   A man doesn't understand the Bible by knowing Greek and Hebrew.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:13.100]   He understands the Bible because he's got the Spirit of God in him.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:19.500]   The princes of this world, says Paul, didn't know this message and they rejected Christ.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.740]   But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:28.500]   The Spirit, "For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:33.380]   We have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit that is of God,
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.660]   that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:42.620]   Which things also we speak in words that the Holy Spirit teacheth.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:49.660]   The key to the understanding of the Bible is not a knowledge of the original languages.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:56.580]   You can have that and still be ignorant of the message, as so many are and have been,
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.820]   unfortunately.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:04.940]   To say this, it seems to me, betrays this essential principle in connection with this
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.940]   realm.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:11.820]   It's the man who has a spiritual understanding who understands the Word of God.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:19.700]   Of course, as the Protestant reformers and as Tyndale and others said, it must be in
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.860]   a language that a man can understand.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.700]   But we have it in a language that we can understand.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.660]   We have it in English.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:33.820]   And what a man needs, therefore, above everything else is the power of the Spirit illuminating
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:34.820]   his mind.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:40.420]   John, in his first epistle, in chapter 2, in verses 20 and 27, you remember, says, "You
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.100]   have no need that anyone teach you."
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.100]   Why?
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.100]   You've got an unction.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.100]   You've got an anointing.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   So, to say that a man cannot read his Bible and that a man cannot preach if he lacks knowledge
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:58.820]   of Greek and Hebrew seems to me to militate against an understanding of the Bible and
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.300]   the true character of preaching.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:06.100]   True preaching is the conveying of this message.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.740]   The early church did it when she hadn't even got our New Testament documents.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.020]   It was a message that they'd heard and had believed.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.300]   And there are many others who preached on that basis and that alone.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.980]   Very well, then.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:25.980]   So I'm arguing that what is needed by the men who come here is a sufficient knowledge
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:33.240]   of Greek and Hebrew to enable them to use their commentaries and to read the translations
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:39.820]   in an intelligent manner to be able to follow the argumentation of the great authorities
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.620]   for one view rather than another.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:49.940]   No student who comes here, indeed I'll go further, 99.9% of students who go to the
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:56.980]   Bible to any place of learning will never know enough Greek and Hebrew to argue with
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.940]   the great professors.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:03.340]   So what they need is this basic essential knowledge.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.340]   What do they need, then?
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.340]   Here they've got it.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.260]   Here they've got the Bible in a language they understand.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.700]   What they need now to be taught is the Bible message.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:19.800]   The whole message, the particular messages of the particular books.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:25.380]   So they will be taught in what's called exegesis, a true understanding of what the
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:32.660]   text is saying but still more important, hermeneutics, how to use this, how to convey it, how to
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.980]   apply it, how to present it to the people.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.380]   That's the thing that's needed.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:42.580]   You may have expert knowledge of exegesis, but if you're lacking this other matter, you're
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.060]   going to be a very poor preacher.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   What else?
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.340]   Well, they'll be taught theology.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.500]   They won't be taught philosophy here.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:55.740]   We haven't catered for any teaching of philosophy except in apologetics, which is going to come
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.680]   at the end.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.820]   Not philosophy, not speculation, not what clever people think.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:09.340]   It's a knowledge of God derived from the biblical revelation.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.580]   What have we got to say about theology?
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:17.640]   Well, I think that theology, while it is most valuable, and the students are going to be
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:25.740]   taught theology, and some of us believe in theology very profoundly, but we must realize
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.860]   that there are certain dangers.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:34.860]   Increasingly I've come to the view that theology should never be separated from the Bible.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:41.220]   If I were pressed hard, I would say that theology should never be taught except through sermons.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:47.280]   The fallacy is to turn theology into an abstract, theoretical, academic subject.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.960]   It is not that.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:53.220]   It is knowledge of God.
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.540]   So these men are to be taught biblical theology.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:04.740]   The doctrines that emerge as you go through your Bible, and having got your biblical theology,
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:11.300]   they will then learn how to systematize it, how to put it all together in a more logical
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:16.820]   form in order that they can present it, as it were, to the people.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:23.060]   But it's very important that it should be presented in the right way.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:29.620]   Never abstractly, but always as something which comes out of the Scriptures.
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:34.980]   Now what is the purpose of theology?
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:39.540]   This is a great and a very important question.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.340]   What is the purpose of theology?
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:47.100]   And here again, there have been many mistakes.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.140]   Theology has got to be handled very carefully.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.980]   There may be people who think, because of the character of this sponsoring committee,
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:53:00.520]   that this is going to be an institution that is going to turn out dry as dust theologians,
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.260]   the most boring preachers in the world.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:07.180]   Well now I assure you that that's not going to happen.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.980]   What is the business of theology?
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:15.420]   What's theology, what is doctrine meant to do?
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:20.180]   First and foremost, it is never meant to be a prison house.
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.940]   It's never meant to be a straight jacket.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:28.220]   I've known many men for whom theology has been just that.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.300]   It's a straight jacket.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.060]   And there they are, hemmed in by their theology, afraid they're going to say something wrong.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.780]   That's not the business of theology.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.420]   Theology is not a prison.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.040]   It's not a thing that fetters a man, puts him into a straight jacket.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   What is it then?
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:54.260]   Well, theology, if you like, is what the structure, this bony structure of a man's body is to
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.260]   the body.
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.260]   It's like a skeleton.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:02.620]   Or if you like, theology is like the scaffolding that you put up when you're going to erect
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.300]   a great building.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.300]   You don't see this.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:11.700]   It's there, and it's essential it should be there if you're to have good preaching.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:18.180]   But you don't preach it in that skeletal, structural manner.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:25.140]   It's there to safeguard you from saying anything wrong or from going astray.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.620]   Theology is much more like railway lines to guarantee that you are going in the right
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:34.780]   direction and that you're going to arrive at the right destination.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.980]   But it implies movement.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:43.940]   It isn't something restricting, prohibited, not something that shuts you down, something
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.940]   that inhibits freedom and liberty and power.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.460]   The moment a man is hemmed in and tied down and crippled by his theology, he's showing
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:58.780]   that incidentally he's a very bad theologian and certainly has a wrong view of the purpose
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.900]   of theology.
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.120]   What is theology?
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.260]   Theology means a knowledge of God.
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:14.180]   And the greater the theologian, the more he should bow down in the presence of his majesty.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.980]   What's the end of theology?
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:16.980]   It's this.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:24.280]   It's to make a man say at the end of his course, "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.340]   And if he doesn't bring him to that, he'd better be very careful.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:35.060]   And the business of the tutors is so to present theology that it leads to that wonderful result.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.060]   Theology, what is it?
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.700]   It's something that tells me, "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:46.540]   The ground on which thou standest is holy ground."
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:52.220]   You don't discuss theology smoking pipes or cigarettes or drinking beer.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:55.300]   You don't do it in a jocular, light-hearted manner.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.020]   It's knowledge of God.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.900]   So it must be done with reverence and with godly fear.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.260]   That's the end of theology.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.260]   What else are there to be taught?
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.260]   Church history.
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.900]   I regard this as extremely important.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:17.420]   The history of the great doctrines, how they came in, how they developed, the disputes.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.620]   We are in an age of transition, you see.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.300]   We're in an age which is doubting everything.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.960]   So we can learn a great deal from the past.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.580]   We are back again in the early centuries of the Christian era in this respect.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:36.180]   So this history of the doctrines is going to be of extreme importance.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.660]   Not only that, the history of the denominations.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.820]   The denominations are talking about amalgamating.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.340]   They're all becoming one.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:51.340]   And some people are fighting, sort of lost, stand in ditches for their denomination.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.620]   Most of them don't know why they belong to it.
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.140]   They have no idea how their denomination ever came into existence.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   But it's my denomination and I'm going to fight for it to the last drop of my blood.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:06.780]   It's a very good thing for people to be taught how the denominations first came into being.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.340]   Well that's a part of church history.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.980]   The biographies of the saints of God that have adorned the church.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:16.580]   How wonderful it is.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.660]   These young men are to be exalted to read these.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.040]   They're to be told about them.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.420]   And when they think that they're great preachers, when they read a little bit about a man like
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.060]   Whitefield, they'll come to the conclusion that they've never preached at all and are
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.420]   never likely to.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.980]   However, what else?
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.380]   Church history, revivals, revivals.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.060]   We are living in a barren age.
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.060]   Things are difficult.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:42.220]   The churches are having a struggle.
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.540]   What's the greatest need?
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:49.420]   It is, as we heard in the prayer, a revival, a great revival of religion.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.980]   Well, these young men will be told about that and will be directed to books which will give
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:58.180]   them a yet greater knowledge about this.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.180]   What else?
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.180]   Apologetics.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.700]   This is where it comes in, a little bit of philosophy.
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.700]   What for?
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.020]   Well, simply to know how wrong it is.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:09.460]   Not to have positive learning, but to be able to refute it.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.980]   And the cults and all these other things that are around and about us.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:17.020]   Suddenly joined a cult and he or she seems to have much more than I've got and they're
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.420]   tending to the... he can tell them why they shouldn't go.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.420]   This is apologetics.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:28.820]   Now, the tragedy in many institutions has been that they've been controlled by apologetics.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.020]   That's entirely wrong.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.780]   That's negative.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:39.340]   Our men are to be positive, but they are incidentally to know something about these arguments against
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.660]   false teaching.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:46.140]   And that is the place of apologetics and it only comes in at that point.
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:53.060]   Otherwise we shall be entirely negative and that's of no value at a time like this.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:59.100]   I don't take your time in saying anything about the pastoral side.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:04.820]   I believe, as I said just now, that in a sense pastors have to be born also.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:10.980]   But certain things can be said which men can impart out of a long experience and others
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.260]   who've had a shorter experience.
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:17.580]   Men need help about these matters and that will be provided for them.
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:21.300]   But we have no place for the teaching of psychology.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.340]   That's been the great vogue.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:28.780]   Pastoralia, psychology, the psychology of men in various conditions.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:29.780]   No, no.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:35.180]   It's a spiritual matter and it comes out of our knowledge of the word of God.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.460]   Very well then, what is the business?
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.260]   What is the business of this college?
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.060]   What do we hope it's going to do?
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:50.980]   Let me quote to you some words that a man called Peter Brown has written in his excellent
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:55.060]   biography of the great Saint Augustine.
[00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:04.860]   The problem is no longer one of training men for a task, training a man for a task he will
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.020]   later accomplish.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.780]   That's not the business of a theological seminary.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:17.740]   It is no longer one of training a man for a task he will later accomplish.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:31.380]   It is one of making him wider, wider, of increasing his capacity at least to take in something
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:38.220]   of what he will never hope to grasp completely in this life.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.060]   That's the most you can do for any man.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:46.420]   Here a man comes, he's converted, born again, he's been reading his Bible, he's got a certain
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   amount of knowledge.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.220]   Yes, what's the business of the college?
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:56.300]   To make him wider, not in the sense of going in for philosophy, but to widen the knowledge
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.860]   he's already got.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:05.700]   To give him a deeper understanding, to make him a more profound thinker.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:11.540]   Indeed, if I were asked to sum it up in one word and ask what is the main function of
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:18.660]   such a seminary, I would say it is to teach men to think, so that when they've left the
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:24.300]   college they can go on thinking and not simply pull out the notes which they took down when
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.420]   they were in college and read out an answer when they're asked the question.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:33.980]   The tragedy of so many men who've been to theological colleges and seminaries is this,
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.140]   that they've never thought after they've left their college.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:42.140]   They've lived on what they were told and took down in a mechanical dictation system in their
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.460]   seminary and they always refer to the notes they took down.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.220]   No, no, this is only a beginning.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:55.660]   It's to widen a man, to increase his capacity at least, to take in something of what he
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:00.100]   will never hope to grasp completely in this life.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.100]   Why?
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.380]   Because it's a knowledge of God.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:09.740]   The college is here to give men a greater love of the word than they've ever had, a
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:15.700]   greater desire to dig into its profundities and into its mysteries, to read everything
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:21.780]   he can to help him, and to go out into the world and go on doing this, go on learning
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:31.700]   and increasing and developing in every respect until he's called home to his final reward.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:42.020]   And indeed on top of all this, it is, as I said, to inspire these men, to send them out
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:48.420]   with a burning desire to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:53.020]   If their hearts are not warmer when they go out from you than when they came in, well,
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.920]   these tutors will have failed.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:01.140]   I was reading on it the other day a statement written in a letter by a man called Robert
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.140]   Roberts.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:09.180]   He happened to be a Welshman who lived at the end of the 18th century, a Seraphic preacher.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:14.420]   He came up to preach in London for eight weeks in 1797.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:17.660]   He came up to preach to his fellow countrymen.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.860]   He wasn't very good at English, but he was a wonderful Welsh preacher.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.260]   But while he was up, he went round some of the English churches.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.420]   He found them packed out, great congregations.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:33.060]   And amongst other places, he went to Whitfield's Tabernacle in Tottenham Court Road.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.060]   And writing to a friend, this is what he said.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:42.720]   He said, "I felt while I was there a groaning in my heart and spirit which said," quoting
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:53.340]   now from Genesis 22, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.340]   offering?"
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:05.420]   Then he goes on, "Here is an altar, here is an offering, but where is the fire?
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:12.760]   Here I'm looking at Whitfield's pulpit, but where is his God?"
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.160]   Now that's the vital thing, isn't it?
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.720]   What's the business of a college?
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:29.280]   Oh, it's to help these men to provide the wood, to provide the offering, in a sense,
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.120]   which is this great knowledge of salvation.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.320]   This is what we can do.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.340]   But if the fire doesn't descend upon it, it is lifeless, and it will be more or less
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.940]   useless and valueless.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.480]   You can be in the pulpit of Whitfield.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.120]   You can have Whitfield's knowledge, and much more than he had.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.640]   He was not a very learned man, you know.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:02.220]   But the secret of Whitfield was his God.
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:11.200]   And we are concerned that this seminary should not be a dry as dust academic institution,
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:17.120]   trying to get first class honors and high degrees determined by secular universities
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.680]   like that of the University of London.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.640]   No, no.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:31.580]   We are hoping to produce men who will put everything in order so that the fire may descend
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.400]   upon it.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:39.240]   And we have every confidence in the members of this faculty whom we have appointed and
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:44.840]   who are so ready to give their services in the way that you've already heard.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:55.400]   We have every confidence that their greatest desire is that the fire may descend upon the
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.600]   offering that is on the altar.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.720]   Pray for them, my dear friends.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.160]   Pray for the prosperity and the future of this seminary.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.320]   Pray for the students who come.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.480]   Do everything you can to help them and to encourage them.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:19.120]   Pray for the members of this faculty, that they may be given strength and understanding,
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:25.600]   and above all, the spiritual insight that everything that shall be done here shall be
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:37.200]   done to the praise and the honor and the glory of the great God, whom it's our privilege
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.040]   to try to serve.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
