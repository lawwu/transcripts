[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   What I like to do is I like to buy properties that you can immediately bump up the value,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.080]   and then it goes up gradually from there, right? So imagine you buy, let's go simple math, right?
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.760]   You buy $100,000 property that you can just make look a little bit nicer, and now it's worth 150.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.720]   Maybe you got to put a little money into it or whatever. Let's say now it's worth from 100.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.640]   Now it's worth 150. Well, now it appreciates from 150 upward. It's not starting at the 100. So you
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.280]   immediately started to this new high level, and then it goes from there. So that's one of my
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.760]   favorite strategies. We call that value-add investing. It's where you immediately add value.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.000]   That is not what REITs do, and that's why REITs get a lower return. It's because REITs
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.680]   typically will just buy a property that's already there, and they're just banking on
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.800]   3% per year rent raises to make all of their wealth.
