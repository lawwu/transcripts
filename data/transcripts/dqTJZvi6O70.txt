[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Most of you present will remember that at the moment we are dealing with the work of
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.920]   the Holy Spirit in the application of redemption.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.880]   We have been taking these biblical doctrines systematically, and now we have arrived at
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.160]   that point.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.000]   And in particular, we are dealing with the great biblical doctrine of sanctification.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.240]   We have already considered how we are called, effectually, by the preaching of the Word
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.800]   as the result of the operation of the Spirit, and how we are regenerated and given new life,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.640]   and how we are given the grace of repentance and of faith, which we have to exercise, and
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.400]   how we are declared to be just, and how we are adopted into the family of God.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.720]   And then this is the next step.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.280]   I say the next step speaking logically, not in a temporal or a chronological manner.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.280]   And we began last Friday evening our consideration of this great and vital doctrine of sanctification.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.040]   Our remarks last Friday were of an introductory character.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.080]   I pointed out how this subject of all subjects has become one of controversy.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.440]   So we looked very briefly at the history of the doctrine, especially during the last two
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.360]   hundred years.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.200]   Then we gave a general definition.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.880]   It means that we are separated unto God, separated from the world, separated from all defilement,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   set apart for God and for God's service.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.880]   That is the real meaning of sanctification.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   And that, of course, has two sides to it.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   We are set apart from God in an external manner, in the same way as the mount on which God
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.280]   gave the law to Moses is referred to as the holy mount.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.800]   The vessels in the temple are the holy vessels.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.320]   They are set apart for this peculiar function.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.480]   But also, of course, sanctification means an inner separation, an inner cleansing from
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.560]   the pollution of sin, in order that we may be God's people and at his service.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   Now when we normally speak of sanctification, what we tend to mean is that second.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720]   The Bible, of course, teaches the other very plainly.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.760]   We had it in the reading at the beginning.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.520]   You notice how Peter says that we are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.360]   Father through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.200]   He said, "By the Spirit to obedience, to faith, and to the blood of sprinkling, whereby
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   we are justified."
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.160]   That is the external sense of sanctification.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:06.040]   But we are concerned in particular about this internal work, this cleansing, this purifying,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.320]   which the Holy Spirit does within us.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.440]   And I ended last Friday by saying that there are three main schools of thought with respect
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.400]   to how this work is done.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.000]   I am not going to repeat all that again.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.880]   I will simply remind you of the three schools.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.480]   First of all, the various perfectionist schools.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.560]   And secondly, the school which teaches what it calls the principle of counteraction, that
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.280]   we are not delivered altogether from sin, but that sin, while it remains in us, is counteracted
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.000]   by the law of the liberty of life in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.280]   And that as long as we look to him and rely upon him, we shall be kept from sin.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.160]   But sin is still in us, and we are not sinners.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.040]   And the third and the last view was that which teaches that sanctification is a process which
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.520]   starts from the very moment of our regeneration, that there is no gap between justification
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.640]   and sanctification, and that it is a process that goes on throughout our lives and which
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.320]   will only be completed beyond this life and beyond the grave.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.300]   Well, now, then, those are the three views which it is good for us to keep in our minds
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.880]   as we try to approach this problem, this question, in a more direct and expository manner.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.720]   It seems to me that there are certain principles that are taught quite plainly and clearly
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.560]   in the Scripture, and we must test those three views and theories by these principles.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   Now, here is the first.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.800]   The first great principle that you find everywhere in the Bible, in the Old Testament as well
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:01.480]   as in the New, is this, that our sanctification is God's will for us.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   Now, if you want a text for this, there is the great statement in the first epistle to
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.960]   the Thessalonians, the fourth chapter and the third verse, where we are told explicitly,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.080]   "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification."
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:32.640]   Now, I suggest to you that that is the starting point, that sanctification is God's will for
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   us.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   Now, that's fundamental.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:45.520]  , let me put it to you like this, the ultimate purpose which God has in doing everything
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.600]   that he has done for us is our sanctification.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.920]   God's purpose in doing everything that he did in the Old Testament is ultimately our
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   sanctification.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.760]   God's purpose when he sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, was still
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.960]   our sanctification.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.920]   When Christ went to the death of the cross, the object was still our sanctification, our
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.120]   perfection.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.720]   And in giving the Holy Spirit, indeed everything I say that God has done about us and our salvation
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.840]   has as its end and object our sanctification.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.100]   Now, to me it is absolutely vital and essential that we should grasp that principle.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.600]   If you want further proof of it, you'll find it in the seventeenth chapter of the Gospel
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   according to St. John.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.640]   There you'll read this in the seventeenth verse, "Our Lord is about to leave his own,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.840]   and he's praying to the Father for them."
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   And what does he pray?
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.920]   This is his prayer, "Sanctify them through thy truth.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.520]   Thy word is truth."
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:03.080]   Indeed, he goes further and says this, you'll find it in the nineteenth verse, "And the
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:13.880]   Father for their sakes," he says, "I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   the truth."
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.640]   Now, when our Lord there says, "I sanctify myself," he is referring to what is going
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.840]   to happen to him on the cross.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.120]   He says, "I'm putting myself at your disposal.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.680]   I'm separating myself unto this final bit of work that you have for me to do, that's
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.120]   nothing but the death upon the cross."
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.160]   He does that in order that you and I may be sanctified.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.120]   You see, it is the object which is behind everything.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.400]   Take another statement of it by the Apostle Paul in the epistle to Titus in the second
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.600]   chapter and the fourteenth verse.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:08:00.960]   "Who gave himself for us," says the Apostle, "that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.640]   and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.880]   That's why he died for us on the cross, for that, for nothing less than that.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.040]   There's a hymn which puts it well, isn't there?
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.000]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.480]   Yes, but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.520]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.160]   He died to make us good.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.840]   The tendency is, of course, to forget the second line and to associate, as I shall show
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.400]   you in a moment, the death upon the cross only with forgiveness.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.120]   But the Bible never does that.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:47.400]   Well, very well, then, I say, the first principle to grasp is that this is the end and object
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.720]   of the whole process of salvation.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.800]   If that is true, then I think we must recognize that there are certain dangers which must
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   be avoided at all costs.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.280]   And here they are.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.360]   Let me note them for you.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:13.280]   The first great danger, obviously, therefore, is the danger of isolating these various doctrines
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.440]   and of separating them from one another in a false way.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.880]   Now, those who have been attending these addresses regularly—and this, incidentally, is the
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.240]   53rd—will have noticed that scarcely a Friday night has come and gone but that I've said
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:37.800]   this, that nothing is so clear as you work through the Bible and look at its doctrines
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.200]   as the way in which they all belong together.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.040]   Every one of them fits into another.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.680]   They all form one great piece.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.360]   They are not disjointed, dismembered things that loosely hang together.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.880]   There is a vital connection between them all.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.480]   And we have seen that all along.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.360]   And therefore, I say, there is nothing so fatal as to separate these doctrines from
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   one another.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.800]   Now, it's a right thing to distinguish them.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.960]   But there's all the difference in the world between distinguishing between things and
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.440]   separating them.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.720]   For the purposes of thought, and indeed in accordance with the Scripture, you've got
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.920]   to distinguish justification and sanctification.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.480]   But that's a very different thing from separating them.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   And if there is one thing that we must never do, it is to separate justification from sanctification.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.080]   Because according to this teaching, they are part of the same process.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.720]   They are part of God's great movement of salvation, which is one.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.280]   And therefore, I say, we must never put these gaps between them, and suggest that you can
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.480]   have one without having the other, that you can be justified without being sanctified,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:07.600]   or that you can remain justified only for years and only later become sanctified.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.080]   That seems to me to be something which is thoroughly unscriptural.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.680]   Take this evidence for example.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.200]   You remember that great statement of Paul's in the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   Romans?
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:28.840]   "Whom he hath called, them he hath also justified; and whom he hath justified, them he hath also
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   glorified."
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:37.120]   Now, the apostle, in other words, is saying there that this whole process of salvation
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.720]   is one.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.160]   And that when God starts this work in a man, there is a sense in which the whole work is
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   already complete.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.940]   He goes straight from justification to glorification.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:57.680]   So that it is very wrong, I say, to draw these divisions and distinctions which mean separation.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.240]   Or take another statement of it by the apostle.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:09.800]   In 1 Corinthians 1.30 he says this, "But of him," he says, "are ye in Christ Jesus, who
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:18.040]   of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:25.320]   Now, you see, it is the Lord who has made all these things to us.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.240]   And therefore I say, we must not separate them for this good reason.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.840]   You cannot divide the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.280]   You are either in Christ or else you are not in Christ.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.360]   If you are a Christian, you are joined to Christ, and all the benefits of Christ are
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   yours.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.880]   Now, we saw that very clearly when we were dealing with that great doctrine of the union
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.200]   of the believer with Christ.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.120]   The great doctrine of Romans 5 and 6.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.560]   Paul says, "You have died with him, you were crucified with him, you have died with him,
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.660]   you were buried with him, you have risen again with him, you are seated in the heavenly places
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.260]   with him already."
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.220]   In other words, if you are in Christ, you are in Christ.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:17.520]   And he is made unto us not justification only, but sanctification also, and redemption.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.760]   He is the all and the in all.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:28.160]   And therefore I do suggest to you that the people who separate justification and sanctification
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   and say that they have no essential inherent connection are guilty of dividing Christ.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.960]   And we have a right to ask them, "Is Christ divided?"
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.240]   That then is our first deduction.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:52.200]   God's will, God's purpose in the whole of salvation, in everything he has done in
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.080]   his Son and by the Spirit, is our sanctification.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.640]   Therefore I say we cannot stop at any given point and say that certain people are only
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.760]   justified but that they have nothing to do with sanctification.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.000]   However, let me go on.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.040]   The second danger, therefore, is this.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:21.520]   It is the danger of thinking in terms of seeking pardon and forgiveness only from Christ, and
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.800]   then of imagining that later on we are to seek our sanctification.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.520]   Now you are familiar with the teaching which says that.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:37.640]   "Ah yes," they say, "so and so, he sought salvation, he believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.220]   and his sins are forgiven."
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.800]   But they say he hasn't gone on to sanctification yet.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.000]   He has remained at that first stage of justification and of forgiveness.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.120]   And they now believe it to be their duty to try to get him to go on to sanctification
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.600]   and to receive that as he received his justification.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:05.360]   But surely that is utterly false reasoning for this reason.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:13.240]   A man cannot seek forgiveness only for this good reason.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.560]   Why does a man seek forgiveness?
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   Why should anybody desire forgiveness of sins?
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   Well, there can be only one answer to that question.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   Some people, of course, falsely, when they seek forgiveness, are only seeking a feeling
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.600]   of comfort within themselves, but that is not seeking true forgiveness.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.320]   To seek forgiveness must mean this, that that man has seen something of the holiness of
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.240]   God, and the holiness of God's law.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.960]   He has also seen himself as a sinner.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.000]   He must have hated this thing which has separated him from God.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.400]   And therefore, if he is truly seeking forgiveness, he must be anxious to be delivered from that
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.440]   which has made him miserable and made him sin against God, and which has put him into
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.480]   such a dangerous position.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.600]   Surely that is the basis of seeking forgiveness.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.320]   I see no meaning in the term forgiveness if it doesn't mean that.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.160]   It doesn't just mean having a comfortable feeling inside you.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:23.040]   No, no, if you're concerned about forgiveness, you know something about yourself as a hell-deserving
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   sinner.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.920]   Now, in dealing with repentance, we had to go into that in detail.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.040]   And we pointed out how in true repentance the whole man is involved.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.560]   His mind understands this truth.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.800]   His heart feels it.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:46.080]   We emphasized, didn't we, in passing at that time, that until comparatively recently,
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.960]   repentance was associated with weeping and people being broken down, and sometimes crying
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.760]   out in agony and failing to find peace.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.080]   That's the biblical repentance, and that's the traditional repentance of the Church throughout
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   the centuries.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.400]   But I say, if a man isn't aware of all these things, there's no true content to his use
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.840]   of the term forgiveness.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:15.880]   But you see, if forgiveness includes all that, it's already the beginning of sanctification.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.000]   The moment a man sees something of the sinfulness of sin and wants to be separated from it,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.640]   that is sanctification.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:32.000]   So I think I've shown you that a true belief in forgiveness, of necessity, includes sanctification,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   the beginning of sanctification.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.640]   Any desire on the part of man to be separated from sin and to be nearer to God and to enjoy
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.160]   God is in itself sanctification.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.140]   That is sanctification, to be separated unto God.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:54.160]   So there can be no true conception of forgiveness apart from sanctification.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.520]   And it is very wrong to think that people can have forgiveness only, and that sanctification
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.560]   plays no part in their lives.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.680]   Well let me go on and put it like this, therefore in the third place.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   There is therefore obviously a very real danger of a false evangelism, which is concerned
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.320]   only about giving people some kind of temporary relief and release, and does not press upon
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.280]   them the vital importance of sanctification.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.040]   An evangelism which stops at forgiveness is not biblical evangelism, because the heart
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:41.000]   of all preaching is this, that the essence of sin is to be separated from God.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.460]   And if we preach reconciliation truly, we must be preaching sanctification.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.360]   It means to be separate from sin, to be restored to the right relationship with God.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.620]   That is sanctification.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:00.960]   So that you see, we must have this as our basic conception, that we are not our own,
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   that we have been bought with a price.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.920]   That's Paul's own argument, isn't it?
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.320]   Paul teaches sanctification in terms of the death upon the cross.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.080]   You are not your own, you have been bought with a price.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.520]   You see, in preaching sanctification, the apostle doesn't only preach the Holy Spirit,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.220]   he's always preaching the cross at the same time.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.320]   These things are linked together.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.680]   And he tells us that in his most primitive evangelism, amongst the Thessalonians for
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:37.640]   instance, this was the effect, that these people had turned from idols to serve the
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.360]   living and the true God.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.560]   To serve God is sanctification.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.960]   So that that was his first message as he was evangelizing those Thessalonians.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.880]   Very well then, I say that the end of all evangelism should be to reconcile men unto
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.960]   God and to separate them unto him.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.320]   In other words, we need to remember that old conception of doing a thorough law work in
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.960]   presenting Christ as Savior.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.040]   These things must always go together.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.000]   And sanctification, in a sense, is a part of the message of evangelism.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.480]   Let me put it finally to you in this form.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.760]   The whole trouble, I believe, with regard to sanctification arises from a fatal tendency
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.040]   to start with ourselves instead of starting with God.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:38.480]   You see, we think of ourselves and our problems and our sins and our needs and things like
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   that, and we go with those things in our mind when we begin to think about sanctification.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.120]   But there, it seems to me, is the whole error.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.360]   You notice the apostle Peter, in preaching sanctification, adopts the exact opposite
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.360]   procedure.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   This is how he puts it.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.400]   "Wherefore," he says, "God, up the loins of your mind be sober, and hope to the end
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.880]   for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   children."
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.400]   It is your relationship to God that determines it.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:19.160]   "As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.920]   because it is written, 'Be ye holy'."
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   Why?
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.040]   Because you are not holy.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.600]   Now this idea has somehow gained currency, that meetings and conventions in which holiness
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.680]   is preached are clinics, where people are to go because they are being bothered by some
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   particular sin.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.480]   That is how it is represented to us.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.640]   So they are encouraged to go because of their problem, some particular sin that is getting
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.520]   them down and which they cannot get rid of, so they go to this clinic which is going to
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.800]   deliver them of their problem.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.320]   My friends, that is not how the Bible puts it.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.840]   There is one reason and one reason only why we should all be sanctified and holy.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.980]   It is this.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.440]   Not that we may be happy, not that we may get rid of our problems.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.800]   We are to be holy because God is holy, because we are God's people, because Christ has died
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.680]   for us and purchased us.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.440]   We do not belong to ourselves.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   We have no right to live that life.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   Be ye holy, for I am holy.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.600]   As obedient children.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:31.300]   Well now then I say that that is the way in which we should start facing all this.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:37.640]   Salvation is God's work from beginning to end, and therefore there can be no gaps.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.000]   You cannot have any sort of hiatus.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.640]   It is something that is started by God, continued by God, and is perfected by God himself.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.960]   Very well then, the moment therefore I argue that we are regenerate and united to the Lord
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:57.720]   Jesus Christ, the process of sanctification has already started.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:04.480]   The moment I receive the divine nature, the moment I am born again, something has come
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.160]   into me which is going to separate me from sin.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:17.040]   You take that statement of James in his epistle in that fourth chapter, which is sometimes
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.200]   not properly understood because of our translations.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.000]   In the fifth verse it reads, "Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The Spirit
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.480]   that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.560]   Now the revised version, Margin, puts that like this, and very rightly.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.040]   It says, "Don't you know that the Spirit that God has given you and that is in you
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   is lasting even to the point of envy, to wean you from the world and its spirit and to God?"
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   That's it.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.720]   So, the moment I am born again and have received the Holy Spirit, this process of separating
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.160]   me has already started.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:03.080]   And I can't be regenerate without the process of sanctification having already started to
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.520]   work within me.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.200]   In other words, the whole object of salvation, I say again, is to separate me from the world
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.120]   and to separate me unto God, in every part and in every step.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.920]   Well, now then, that brings us to the second great principle.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.000]   What is the agent in sanctification?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.960]   If that is the process, if that is God's will, if that is what all salvation is tending
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.880]   unto, how does it take place?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.040]   How does this proceed within us?
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:43.300]   Now, here once more, we must be careful.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:49.560]   We have seen in looking at a number of these doctrines that in some of them, God alone
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   acts.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.160]   In regeneration, for instance, man does nothing.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.260]   It's entirely the action of God.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.320]   In justification, likewise, man does nothing at all.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.880]   Justification is entirely the action of God in declaring and pronouncing us to be just
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.140]   and righteous.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.080]   The same thing applies to our adoption.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.040]   We have nothing to do with our adoption.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.080]   It is God's declaration.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.600]   It's God's action.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.840]   But on the other hand, you remember that when we were considering repentance and faith,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:30.200]   we pointed out that though these again are started by the Holy Spirit, you and I have
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.720]   our part to play.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.160]   We must confess our sins.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.040]   We must forsake our sins.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.280]   We believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.200]   We can't do so without the initial movement of God.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.240]   It's started by him, but then we have to do it, we express it.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.400]   Now then, it is exactly the same with this question of sanctification.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.320]   If you want the classical text to cover this, you must go, of course, to the epistle to
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:07.080]   the Philippians, the second chapter, and the thirteenth verse, Philippians 2.13.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:15.480]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:22.320]   both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:32.520]   Now, it seems to me that there, the balance is presented to us absolutely perfectly.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   So that when we are discussing this question of the agency in sanctification, when we are
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.120]   asking how is this work of sanctification carried on in us, we must start by saying
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.640]   that it is primarily the action of God.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.480]   It is God that worketh in me, both to will and to do.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:01.000]   Very well, now the scripture is quite clear about this, and in a very remarkable manner.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.640]   Sanctification in the scripture is attributed to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   Spirit.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.520]   Let me give you the texts.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:16.040]   Take for instance the way in which it teaches us that it is the Father's work, 1 Thessalonians
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:23.920]   5.23, "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.480]   And I pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body, be preserved blameless unto the
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.240]   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.120]   That attributes it to the Father.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:42.560]   Then in the same way, in Hebrews 13, you remember that great word in verses 20 and 21, "Now
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:48.600]   the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:55.720]   the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   to do his will."
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.840]   It is the God of peace who is going to do this.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.240]   It is the Father.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.600]   It is he who brought the Lord Jesus, his Son from the dead, who is to make us perfect.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.880]   It is the Father's work, so we believe.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.240]   But in exactly the same way, the Scriptures tell us that it is the work of the Son.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:22.920]   And you have noticed how often, in working through these doctrines, we have seen how
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:28.520]   frequently the same work is attributed to the three blessed persons.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:35.040]   There is nothing that I know that is so uplifting as to realize that great truth, that for such
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:43.000]   a worm as I, that the three blessed persons in the Trinity have cooperated in order that
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.960]   I might be rescued and redeemed and made perfect to stand in the presence of God in the judgment.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.320]   But listen to the text about the Son.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.480]   Take Ephesians 5, 25 and 26.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:04.360]   "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:10.680]   it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word."
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.560]   It is the work of the Son.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.640]   He died, he did this, that he might sanctify the church.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:23.960]   And in the same way, as I have already reminded you, in Titus 2, 14, we read that he gave
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   himself for us.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   Why?
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.720]   "Oh, not merely that we might have our sins forgiven, not merely that I might escape
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.360]   hell, not merely that my conscience might be put at rest, he gave himself for us, that
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:43.560]   he might separate unto himself, he redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.960]   a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.720]   It is the work of the Son.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.960]   But in exactly the same way, it is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.840]   It says, "Paul to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 6, 11, 'Such were some of you, but ye are
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:09.160]   washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.840]   by the Spirit of our God.'"
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.240]   By the Spirit.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.640]   And these various other references to his work in separating us.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.720]   "God hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.600]   the truth," he says in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the second chapter and
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.440]   the thirteenth verse.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.960]   Now, while therefore we can say that this is the work of the three blessed persons,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:43.800]   it is especially, of course, the work of the third person, the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.640]   Because as we've seen already, it is he that mediates Christ to us, it is he who applies
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:56.000]   the work of Christ to us, it is he who forms Christ in us, it is he who joins us to Christ,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.080]   it is especially, therefore, his particular work.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.440]   And therefore we can never emphasize this too strongly.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:15.480]   Sanctification is first of all and primarily the work of God in us through and by the Holy
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Spirit.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:24.240]   Therefore, my friends, it seems to me that it is thoroughly unscriptural to say that
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.720]   as a believer, as a Christian, you can be without sanctification and decide yourself
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.160]   to go in for it.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.280]   That is impossible.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.880]   It is God's work, it is his intent, it is his purpose, it is something he is really
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.000]   doing in all whom he has separated unto himself.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.440]   Our Lord died for us in order that this might happen.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.320]   And it is inconceivable that it couldn't happen or that it shouldn't happen in any
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.640]   for whom he has died and for whom he has paid the price of his own blood.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:03.120]   Therefore, I say we start with that and it must be emphasized.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.280]   But having emphasized that, we go on to the second half of the statement.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.040]   It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:20.840]   Because of that, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.200]   Be careful.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.620]   Realize what you're doing.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.620]   Realize who you are.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.760]   That's the meaning of the fear and trembling.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:34.480]   Now here once more, you see, we come to a vital point of difference between justification
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480]   and sanctification.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:43.240]   In justification, as I've reminded you, you and I do nothing because we can't do
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   anything.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.400]   That is the declaratory act of God.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.440]   But here, you and I are called to an activity.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.600]   This again, then, I say, is a crucial point in this whole doctrine of sanctification.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.520]   There are many who are in trouble at this point.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.000]   And there are two extremes who are in trouble.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.140]   There are some people who seem to think that once a man is born again, that the activity
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.400]   of God in him finishes.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.560]   Because God has given him a new nature, they say, he's got nothing to do now but to exercise
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.280]   the new nature.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.480]   And he does that by reading the scriptures and understanding it and applying it.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.760]   He does everything himself in connection with his sanctification.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.600]   Now I've already shown you that that is wrong.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.840]   It is God's work in us.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:40.480]   The first move, the initial move, the motive, the force all along is this power of God working
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.160]   in us both to will and to do.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   So that is wrong.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:48.600]   Yes, but people, you see, in trying to avoid that, they go right to the other extreme.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.200]   And the second school says that man's got nothing at all to do.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.960]   That all he has to do is to passively look to Jesus and abide in him and all the work
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.880]   is done in him and for him.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.540]   Now I reminded you of that last Friday evening in reminding you of how the illustration is
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:10.000]   used of the poker and of the men with the life belt round and about him, which give
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.240]   the impression that one has got nothing to do at all, that the work is done entirely
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.720]   by the Lord and we just look to him.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.360]   The answer to that, as I say, is Philippians 2.13.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.560]   Work out your own salvation because it is God that worketh him.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:33.400]   Now these friends sometimes tell us that surely our Lord in the fifteenth of John is teaching
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:39.080]   this selfsame idea that we do nothing but that we look to him.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.000]   The parable, the picture you remember of the vine and the branches.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.120]   I am the vine and he are the branches.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.680]   And they interpret that as meaning this, that the branch does nothing at all, that the work
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:59.880]   is done entirely by the tree and that the branch is just there to show the fruit.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:06.360]   But that surely is a profound misunderstanding of our Lord's picture.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:13.560]   A branch in a tree is not inactive, a branch in a tree is not like a hollow tube which
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.600]   is inert and has no life in it.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.560]   A branch is full of life.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.240]   Of course the branch can do nothing if it doesn't receive the sap that comes up from
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.240]   the tree.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:30.040]   Yes, that is absolutely essential, but given the sap the branch is full of activity.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.400]   It is throwing things from the air, it is sending things back into the air.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.360]   Every leaf on the branch is very active.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.080]   And it is a complete misunderstanding, surely, of our Lord's picture to think of a branch
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:49.240]   in a tree as if it were just an empty tube which can do nothing at all, purely mechanical.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.200]   It is a very grave misunderstanding.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.640]   A branch is full of life, it is full of vitality, it is a vital process and not a mechanical
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.960]   process.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:07.140]   You see the danger of illustrations, how easily they can be misunderstood.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.760]   But the scripture itself is perfectly clear about this.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.000]   Work out your own salvation.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.680]   You couldn't do that if God didn't work in you first.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.520]   But he works in you in order that you may work out.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:29.480]   God works in us, he works in my will, he works the will to do it that I may want to do it,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.760]   and he also enables me to do it.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.440]   It is God that worketh in you both the will and to do.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.720]   But I've got to do the willing and I've got to do the doing.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.800]   Now let me give you, as I close tonight, a number of statements in the scripture that
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.440]   say exactly the same thing.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.960]   Surely this is something that ought to be perfectly clear to all of us.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.080]   Take the sixth of Romans, for instance.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.520]   You've got a collection of these phrases.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:08.120]   Reckon yourselves, says Paul, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   God.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.240]   Now that's something that you and I've got to do.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.800]   Nobody can reckon this for me, I've got to indulge in that activity.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.520]   The Holy Spirit is working in me and leads me to this recognition, but I'm exhorted to
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.120]   reckon it.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.560]   It's an appeal to me, it's a part of sanctification.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.440]   Then listen to him putting it negatively.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.560]   He says, "Let not sin therefore reign in you, a mortal body."
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.280]   You mustn't let sin reign in you, it's an exhortation to you.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.080]   Then he puts it positively again.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.720]   He says, "Don't yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness and unto sin, but yield
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:52.680]   yourselves unto God and your instruments, and your members as instruments of righteousness
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.160]   and to holiness."
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.560]   You and I have got to yield the members of our body.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.880]   It's a positive thing that you and I have got to do.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.240]   Then listen to him again in the eighth of Romans.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:11.680]   He says, "If you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live."
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   You and I have got to mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.560]   Yes, you notice, through the Spirit.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.180]   Without the Spirit we can't do it.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.240]   That was the error of monasticism.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.160]   That's the error of all morality.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.880]   But having received the Spirit, and the Spirit working in us, then through the Spirit, you
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.680]   and I have got to mortify the deeds of our body.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.600]   Or listen to him again in Colossians 3, 4.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.720]   "Mortify therefore," he says, "your members which are on the earth."
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.120]   You and I have got to do that.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.100]   We are to mortify these members.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.800]   Listen to the other phrases, "Stand fast, fight."
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.540]   Even exhorts us to fight.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.500]   That's not very passive, is it?
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:39:01.380]   Then he says to Timothy specifically, "Flee youthful lusts."
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.660]   Now he's calling upon Timothy to flee, to do something.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.860]   Not to wait to be delivered.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   He's got to flee from them.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.300]   "O man of God," he says to him, "Flee youthful lusts.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.500]   Avoid all these things."
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.580]   He exhorts him positively to seek after righteousness.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.980]   He's got to seek after it.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.940]   He's got to strive after it.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.140]   We are told to put off the old men, to put on the new men.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.260]   But I sometimes think that the most important text of all is 2 Corinthians 7, 1.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.780]   Let me read it to you.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:47.980]   "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:54.020]   of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.900]   If there is any answer to that, I would be very grateful if somebody would be good enough
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.340]   to let me hear it.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:12.980]   "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves."
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:18.180]   Is there any possible alternative exposition of that statement?
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:25.420]   He goes on to say that we must perfect holiness in the fear of God.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.680]   That's the Apostle Paul.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.260]   You see, all these terms point in the same direction.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:40.020]   Indeed, as I've often put it from this book, if what I'm saying isn't true, well then,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.700]   none of these New Testament epistles need ever have been written at all.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.380]   If all a man has got to do to be sanctified is to let go and to let God, is to surrender
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:55.380]   himself and to look to Jesus, well then I say the apostles have wasted an awful lot
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.780]   of ink and of time and of energy in arguing with us about doctrine, in saying, "Therefore,
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:06.420]   in the light of that, now then, apply it, do this, don't do that, cleanse yourselves."
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.260]   Why should they have said all that?
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:16.460]   If all that is necessary is that I surrender and wait and look and abide.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:23.060]   My dear friends, let us be careful lest we arrest the Scriptures.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.940]   If not to our own destruction, then generally to our own confusion.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:37.180]   The Scriptures plainly teach us that God is working in us because he saved us, but he's
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.060]   working in us in order that we may work it out.
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.980]   And those are the ways in which we do it.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.860]   I hope to go into this in greater detail next Friday.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:54.100]   What you and I really have to do, this reckoning, this understanding, this application, this
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:59.220]   mortifying and so on, this cleansing.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:08.380]   But there is the great balance in the Scripture, primarily, initially, vitally, all importantly,
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.820]   the work of God by the Spirit.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:20.540]   But because of that, you and I, as newborn babes, as dearly beloved, as children of God,
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:26.980]   are exhorted to be holy because he is holy.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:33.260]   And his whole purpose in redemption is that we might indeed be children of him, worthy
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.740]   of the name.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.140]   Let us pray.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:46.940]   O our heavenly Father, we come into thy holy presence once more, conscious not only of
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:55.100]   our unworthiness, but conscious of our folly, conscious of our failure, O God, to heed thy
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.140]   word and its teaching.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.020]   O God, we do pray again thy forgiveness.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:09.420]   And we ask that thou wouldst open our eyes more and more to thy blessed truth for us.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:17.300]   O God, it grieves us that we are so slow to learn these things and to put them into practice
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.260]   in our lives.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.180]   We ask thee, therefore, to pardon us and to forgive us, and that thou wouldst work so
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:31.740]   mightily within us that we shall all hate the sin that remains in us, that we shall
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:37.620]   not allow it to have dominion over us, but that we shall yield ourselves and all our
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:43.420]   members unto thee and as instruments of righteousness and of holiness.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:50.140]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:58.340]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.700]   Amen.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.620]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
