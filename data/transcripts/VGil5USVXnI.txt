[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - I'll read tonight Psalm 40 from the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   It's for the choir director of David, a Psalm.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.240]   I hoped earnestly for Yahweh and he inclined to me
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.440]   and heard my cry for help.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   He brought me up out of the pit of destruction,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.540]   out of the miry clay, and he set my feet upon a high rock.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.640]   He established my steps.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.520]   He put a new song in my mouth,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360]   a song of praise to our God.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.520]   Many will see and fear and will trust in Yahweh.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.040]   How blessed is the man who has made Yahweh his trust
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.800]   and has not turned to the proud,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.840]   nor to those who stray in the falsehood.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.520]   Many, oh Yahweh, my God,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.760]   are the wondrous deeds you have done.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120]   Your thoughts towards us, there's none to compare with you.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.080]   I would declare and speak of them,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.320]   but they are too numerous to recount.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.580]   Sacrifice and meal offering you have not desired.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.080]   My ears you have opened,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.600]   burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.680]   Then I said, behold,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.460]   I come in the scroll of the book it is written of me.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.880]   I desire to do your will, oh my God.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.060]   Your law is within my inner being.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.520]   I proclaim the good news of righteousness
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.640]   in the great assembly.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480]   Behold, I do not restrain my lips, oh Yahweh.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.080]   You know.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.480]   I do not conceal your righteousness within my heart.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.840]   I speak of your faithfulness and your salvation.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.000]   I do not hide your loving kindness
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.320]   and your truth from the great assembly.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.960]   You, oh Yahweh, will not withhold your compassion from me.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.440]   Your loving kindness and your truth will continually guard me
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040]   for evils beyond number have surrounded me.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.400]   My iniquities have overtaken me so that I am not able to see
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.840]   they are more numerous than the hairs of my head
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.240]   and my heart has failed me.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.600]   Be pleased, oh Yahweh, to deliver me.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.040]   Make haste, oh Yahweh, to help me.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340]   Let those be ashamed and humiliated together
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.640]   who seek my life to sweep it away.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.440]   Let those be turned back and dishonored
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.880]   who delight in evil against me.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.080]   Let those be appalled because of their shame
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   who say to me, aha, aha.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.140]   Let those who love your salvation say continually,
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.360]   Yahweh, be magnified.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.280]   As for me, I'm afflicted and needy.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.080]   May the Lord think of me.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.960]   You're my help and the one who rescues me.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.080]   Do not delay, oh my God.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.240]   (silence)
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
