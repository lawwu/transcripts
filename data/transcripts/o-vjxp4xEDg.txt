[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.000]   Paul's epistle to the Colossians, in that first chapter out of which we read at the
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.320]   beginning and in the 28th verse.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:25.160]   The 28th verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Colossians, "Whom we preach,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.040]   warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.440]   perfect in Christ Jesus."
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:46.080]   Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.280]   every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.400]   In those words, as you must have realized from the reading at the beginning, the Apostle
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.360]   Paul sums up his ministry, his work as a minister and as a preacher of the gospel.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.640]   He has already reminded these people that God had called him to this and had made him
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.880]   a minister and had given him what he calls a dispensation of the gospel.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.400]   And here he sums up his work.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.840]   He looks at himself and, as it were, asks himself the question that he may answer it
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.000]   not only for himself but for them, "What is this preaching?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400]   What am I doing?
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.720]   What do I preach?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.600]   What is my message and why do I preach it?"
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.760]   Now, it is important, if we are to understand the full significance of what he says here,
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.680]   that we should realize what led him to do this.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.520]   Why did he ever do this thing?
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   And the answer, unfortunately, is but too simple.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   He did this because these members of the church at Colossae, whom he had never actually seenâ€”he
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.720]   reminds them of that in the second chapter, that many of them, perhaps most of them, had
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.440]   never seen him actually in the flesh.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680]   They had heard of him, but they had never seen him.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.240]   They had been converted into somebody else's ministry, but that does not matter.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   He is writing to them.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.280]   And he writes to them, I say, because of a certain confusion which had arisen amongst
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   them.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.320]   At Inuit there was the danger of a confusion.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.400]   There were certain clever people going round these early Christian churches at the very
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   beginning in the first century and muddling the believers, causing confusion in their
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.440]   minds.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.980]   They claimed to be very able men, very learned men.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.320]   They called themselves philosophers.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.560]   So he says, you see, in this eighth verse of the second chapter, "Beware lest any men
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.400]   spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160]   of the world, and not after Christ."
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   Well, it is a comfort to us who are Christian people at a time like this, when there is
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.160]   so much confusion in the church, and so many things are passing under the name of Christian.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.840]   You see them in the paper and in the correspondence columns, men claiming to be Christian, denying
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.320]   the Old Testament, this, that, and the other, and people are utterly confused as to what
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.640]   it really means to be a Christian, as to what Christianity is, why they should believe it.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   Well, now, it is a comfort, I say, to know that there is nothing new in all that.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.480]   There were false teachers, even in the early church.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.760]   There were people who had insinuated themselves into the life of the early church, and they
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.400]   were claiming for themselves an unusual degree of knowledge and of learning and of insight.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.800]   And they were confusing the simple Christian believers.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.160]   They had got a most complicated system.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.480]   These systems are always very complicated when you put them by the side of this gospel.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   You see, they were teaching that between man and God there was a whole series of angelic
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.840]   beings, intermediaries, and that if a man wanted to have communion with God, he had
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.760]   to go from one of these to the next.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.840]   And at the top of this list was this Jesus.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.400]   He was but the highest intermediary between man and God.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   That was their doctrine, their teaching in its essence.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.800]   And they were attempting to confuse the people at Colossae and in various other places where
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.320]   they went with their newfangled ideas and their false gospels.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.360]   Now that's why the apostle wrote this letter.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:55.280]   It was his sole object in writing it, in order to check once and forever this devilish teaching,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.640]   this denial of the gospel that masqueraded into the name of gospel.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.320]   He wants to expose it.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.680]   You see, it was a mixture, as I say, of this philosophy, which just means man's thinking,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.920]   human ideas, and a sort of mysticism, some vague experiences which you get.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.440]   And they claimed that this was very wonderful, and they liked to contrast it with the simple
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   preaching of Paul.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.520]   You see, that man Paul, he's always talking about the cross and the death of Christ, always
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   the same old thing.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.720]   This is the real thing, which sounded so marvelous and so intellectual and so wonderful, so modern
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   and up-to-date.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.320]   Now it was, I say, in order to expose all that for what it really is that the apostle
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.600]   wrote this letter, and explains to them what the gospel is, and explains to them how he
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.960]   preached that gospel.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.520]   And I, my dear friends, as I resume my ministry here, feel that I can do nothing better than
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:05.160]   repeat what the great apostle did in writing here to these members of the Church at Colossae.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.480]   For there is appalling confusion today as to what Christianity really is.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.360]   It's almost incredible, but it's true.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.120]   All sorts of notions and ideas are current.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.040]   Some think a man makes himself a Christian, others think it's this marvelous philosophy
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.500]   and ideas about this and that, and we are confronted again by this same confusion.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.680]   And the masses of the people, I sometimes think, are outside the Christian Church, because
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   they say, "Well, what is Christianity?"
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.280]   These Christians themselves don't seem to agree.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.920]   Here are men getting up and denying completely and utterly what others are saying.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   What is Christianity?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.160]   A man in the street is tempted to say, "Well, I'm not going to bother with it until these
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.320]   men decide amongst themselves as to what it really is."
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.000]   Well, how can we know what it is?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.200]   And surely there is only one answer.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.160]   It's not what I think or anybody else thinks.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.320]   It's what is plainly taught in the Scriptures.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.220]   The Christian Church is established upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.680]   I know nothing apart from what I have in this book, and my business is simply to expound
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.880]   it, to allow it to speak for itself.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.040]   The moment a man begins to stand in judgment upon this and say, "This isn't true.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.960]   I accept that, but I don't accept this," it's his authority, it's what he thinks.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.320]   That's not our position.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.800]   We know nothing apart from what we have in these records, the foundation of the apostles
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.460]   and the prophets.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.640]   And indeed the apostle Paul himself is very careful to tell us in this very chapter, as
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.080]   he does everywhere else, that his preaching was not his own idea, it wasn't the result
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.900]   of his own meditation and cogitation.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.520]   He says, "Who now rejoices in my sufferings for you, whereof I am made a minister according
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:07.320]   to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God."
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.000]   That's what he means, to fulfil the word of God means give it full scope, let it show
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   itself.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.840]   "That's all I'm here for," he says, "I'm simply here to open out the word to you, to
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.120]   fill it full in that way."
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.520]   He knew nothing apart from that which was given to him by the risen Lord as he commissioned
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.240]   him on the road to Damascus.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.480]   And there is no other authority.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.280]   Very well, now then I say let us take this opportunity therefore of reminding ourselves
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.680]   of certain fundamental and basic and primary truths.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.360]   It's all here in this one verse.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.520]   Let me divide it for you in this way.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.800]   Let's notice first of all what the apostle tells us about the nature of this message,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   the nature of the message.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.520]   "Whom we preach," a better word there would be "whom we proclaim."
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.720]   I says the apostle, "I'm a man who is proclaiming something, I'm making an announcement, I'm
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.880]   making a declaration."
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.760]   And that at once tells us a great thing about this gospel, doesn't it?
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.400]   You see he's a proclaimer of great good news, wonderful good news.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.360]   He's proud of this thing, "Whom we proclaim."
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.960]   He's like a man, I say, who's been commissioned to sound the trumpet call.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.720]   He calls everybody to listen.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.800]   He's got most marvelous good news to give them, the most thrilling good news that this
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.280]   world has ever heard.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   That's what he's doing.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.440]   And therefore you see that tells us a great deal about this gospel.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.840]   This message that we are considering at this moment is the greatest thing in the world
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840]   at this moment.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.520]   There's nothing to compare with it.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.840]   It's the most glorious thing, it's the most wonderful thing.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.040]   Well take that hymn we've just been singing.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.840]   Why does Charles Wesley write like that?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   "Oh," he says, "for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's prayer."
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.600]   Did you sing that honestly?
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.440]   Did you really mean it?
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.800]   Do you feel about this gospel and about this Lord Jesus Christ that you wish you really
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.840]   had a thousand tongues to proclaim what you know about him and what you feel concerning
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   him?
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   Did you feel that?
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.960]   Charles Wesley did, Paul did.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.400]   So you see the way we test whether we believe the gospel or not at the very beginning is
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   that.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:38.320]   Is this to us the most glorious and wonderful thing we've ever heard or ever can hear of?
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   If it isn't, well then it isn't the gospel, that's all.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.440]   You see this idea that by living a good life you make yourself a Christian, there's no
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.000]   good news about that, is there?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.360]   There's nothing thrilling, you don't need a thousand tongues to proclaim that.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.720]   But this is good news, it's a proclamation.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.680]   Very well, let's hurry on to the second thing which he says about it, which is that it's
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.040]   a very clear message.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.640]   You see, when you're making a proclamation it must of necessity be clear.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.280]   You don't proclaim a speculation.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.600]   Now you talk quietly about that, but when you come to the gospel you see you've got
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.000]   the evangelical prophet Isaiah already anticipating the whole thing.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.200]   "Lift up your voice," he says.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.560]   The town crier, the man who's making a proclamation, yes he's going to shout it and that means
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.120]   it's a simple and a clear message.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:39.680]   That's why you can shout it and proclaim it and make it clear as a mighty declaration.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.160]   This I say is no uncertain speculation.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.240]   Have you ever heard a man making a proclamation and saying, "Well now, friends on the whole,
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.360]   I think this may be going to be true."
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.960]   Is that a proclamation?
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   Have you ever heard a man making a proclamation like when a new king or queen comes to the
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.000]   throne, does he deal with ifs and possibilities and perhapss and suppositions?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Of course not.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.120]   I proclaim, I announce.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.280]   That's the gospel.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:15.360]   So that tells us at once that it's not something uncertain or speculative.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.640]   You know, we are not here in a quest tonight.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.600]   We haven't come here to seek and to search after truth.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.440]   We are not like some philosophical society trying to come to some understanding.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   That's not it at all.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.760]   "Whom we proclaim," says Paul.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   "I've got a message.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   It's a clear one.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   I know exactly what it is."
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.000]   And here he gives us a summary of it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.200]   So let's get rid of this notion that you can't tell what Christianity is, that it's just
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.880]   some vague feeling, some wonderful experience you can't describe.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.680]   Let's get rid of this idea that you can't define it and say it is this and it isn't
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   that.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.400]   If it's a proclamation, it's got to be absolutely clear.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.080]   And by the grace of God, it is clear.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.200]   But that leads me to say this third thing about it.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.640]   Did you notice how he keeps on emphasizing this "every man"?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:10.560]   "Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   every man perfect in Christ Jesus."
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.320]   Now why does he repeat that "every man" three times?
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.560]   Is he just one of these people who goes on repeating and adding unnecessary words?
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.480]   Is this just tautology?
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.680]   Is it just the carelessness of a man, bad literary style?
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.680]   No, no.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.200]   He did it very deliberately.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.160]   He wanted to get this point home.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.560]   Warning every man, teaching every man that we may present every man perfect in Christ
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.560]   Jesus.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   Why does he do that?
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.720]   I'll tell you, and this is something very wonderful to me.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.760]   You see, these false teachers, they said quite plainly and openly that their message was
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.160]   only for certain special people.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.360]   They had what became known later as the mystery religions.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.640]   And the whole point about these mystery religions was that there was something secret about
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   them.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.000]   You had to be initiated into the mystery.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.880]   You know, there are societies like that today.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.360]   They've got secrets.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.520]   You don't know.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   We outside, we don't know.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.840]   They've got some marvelous secret in there, but you've got to be initiated.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.760]   This secret, the common people don't know it.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.100]   It's only for these people who are allowed in.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.040]   That was what they were teaching.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.440]   That's the heresy, as I'm reminding you, that the apostle was countering.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.120]   That's his reason for writing his letter.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   So you see, he answers it by repeating "every man, every man, every man."
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.560]   This is not simply for some special initiates.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.160]   It's for all.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.680]   It's a proclamation to the whole world.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.160]   God now commanded all men everywhere to repent.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.080]   And this is still true.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   So you see, I draw a second deduction from this "every man."
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   And again I thank God for this as I stand in this pulpit and try to preach.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.800]   Because this is for every man, it's obviously not based upon our ability or understanding,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.960]   is it?
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.720]   Have you ever tried reading a book on philosophy?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.120]   Well take my advice, don't try it, unless you happen to be specializing on that sort
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   of thing.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.480]   It'll be a sheer waste of time.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.800]   You won't be able to follow it.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.960]   They've got their terms and their arguments and their subtleties.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   And unless you're gifted with unusual ability and have had special training, it'll mean
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   nothing to you.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   It'll be gibberish.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.140]   It's only certain special people.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.560]   You must have ability, you must have knowledge, you must have capacity.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.680]   You must have God.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.520]   That doesn't apply to this.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:50.280]   Here is a gospel that doesn't depend upon our powers, but is the power of God unto salvation,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.120]   to every one that believeth.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.160]   Yes, every one, I said, every man again.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.860]   In other words, you see, it is an all-inclusive gospel.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.640]   And I rejoice in this.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   Let me repeat what this great apostle says.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.720]   He says, "I warn every man.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:15.320]   I teach every man, that I may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.880]   He's challenging the whole world.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.880]   He often said this.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.080]   Listen to him saying it to the Romans.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.920]   "I," he says, "am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.400]   to the unwise, every man."
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.080]   What a gospel.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.920]   Nobody can say that but the preacher of the gospel.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.560]   Oh, your philosophers can say, "I'm a debtor to the Greeks."
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.680]   Yes, the Greeks were natural philosophers.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.680]   It was the home of philosophy.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.340]   "Debtors to the Greeks."
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.760]   But you put your great philosopher and confront him by a congregation of barbarians, people
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760]   who've never studied philosophy.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.960]   And he'd say, "What are you insulting me for?
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   I can't speak to people like that.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.800]   They don't understand my terminology.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.080]   My categories mean absolutely nothing to them.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.120]   Give me men who can understand and I can address them.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.760]   I can't speak to common people, ignoramuses like this.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.960]   He's a debtor to the Greeks but not to the barbarians.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.240]   He's a debtor to the wise but he's not to the unwise.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.280]   That isn't my position," says Paul.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.200]   "I am a debtor both to the Greeks and the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.000]   So as much as in me is, I'm ready to preach the gospel to you that are at home also."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.400]   In other words, this is his challenge.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:31.000]   "I have a message," says Paul, "for the greatest philosopher in the world.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I have a message which he cannot understand, which is beyond him, which leaves him baffled,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.680]   which leaves him completely without understanding.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.400]   I have a message that is so great and glorious and infinite and eternal that the mightiest
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.120]   intellect can't comprehend it.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.840]   I'm a debtor to the mighty, to the Greeks, to the philosophers, to the wise."
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:18:00.640]   But you see, he's at the same time able to say that he's also a debtor to the barbarians,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.400]   to the unwise, to the ignorant.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.640]   And this little man, of course, he exemplifies all this in his own personal life and in his
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   own personal story.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:15.360]   There he is standing on Mars Hill of all places in Athens, addressing a mixed company of Stoics
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.600]   and Epicureans, and he can meet them on their own level.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.800]   He's got a message for them, every man.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:29.200]   But thank God he could visit the Galatians, excitable, emotional, ignorant people, and
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.120]   he could address them also, and he's got quite as much to give them.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.320]   That's the glory of this Gospel.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.240]   The greatest mind in the world can't understand it.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.640]   It can save a little child.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.400]   The mightiest intellect can't comprehend it.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.360]   The most ignorant fool can be saved by it.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.600]   It's for every man.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   It's universal.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:57.800]   Because, I say, it doesn't depend upon our capacity, but upon the power of God in the
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.400]   person of his only begotten Son.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.880]   Very well, there's the nature of the message.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.900]   Let me hurry on from there to my second point.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:10.120]   What is the content of the message?
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.240]   And the Apostle is equally anxious that we should be clear about the content of the message
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.360]   as we are about its nature.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.920]   And here there is no difficulty, he puts it.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.880]   His first word tells us really everything we need to know.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.400]   What is the message of Christianity?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.680]   What am I commissioned to do in this public?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.920]   Am I sent here in order to give my views and ideas and notions about various things?
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:43.240]   Did anybody come here tonight expecting an address on the common market?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.720]   Did you expect me to solve this impasse that is holding up the meeting of the premiers
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.520]   of the British Commonwealth?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.080]   Is that Christianity?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.160]   Is it indeed the Christian view of this, that, or the other?
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   No, no.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:08.560]   Primarily the preaching of this message is whom we preach, this blessed person to whom
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.920]   God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:21.280]   which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:33.640]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise, it's he.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.880]   He is the beginning and the end.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.840]   He is the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.120]   Christianity is Christ.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.800]   And if he isn't at the centre of all your thinking and experience tonight, you're not
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   a Christian.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.960]   It's not your views and ideas and the thousand and one questions that matter.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.800]   It's your attitude to this person.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   It's your relationship to him.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.960]   The vital question is what think ye of Christ?
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.600]   This is what I'm preaching, says Paul.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   This is my proclamation, not these endless intermediaries between man and God, not this
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.240]   hierarchy of angelic beings that bring you into the presence of God.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:14.600]   There's only one whom we preach.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.140]   And God forbid that I or anybody else should ever enter into this pulpit to preach anything
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.240]   but this blessed person.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.720]   We preach not ourselves, says Paul to the Corinthians, but Christ Jesus the Lord.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.160]   I'm not here to talk about myself or to tell you stories about myself or about anybody
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   else.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:41.120]   I'm here to sing my great Redeemer's praise, the glories of my God and King, the triumphs
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.320]   of his grace, whom we preach.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.120]   Well, what is it?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.280]   Well, you start with his person, you see.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:22:00.960]   Christianity consists of this amazing proclamation that God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.120]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.000]   That's it.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.700]   It's all about him.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:15.160]   This person and the facts concerning him and the meaning of the facts concerning him.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   Who is he?
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.040]   That's who you must start.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.320]   We haven't started with Christianity until we've confronted this person, this Jesus,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.520]   this babe that was born in Bethlehem, brought up in Nazareth, the man who worked as a carpenter
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:36.000]   for all those years, the young man who began to preach at the age of 30, who preached,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.560]   worked those miracles, and who died upon a cross and who was buried in a grave and who
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   rose again.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   That's Christianity.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.960]   Who is this person?
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.720]   Now, you see, this is the good news.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.200]   Here we are in a world of trouble, a world of pain, a world of uncertainty, a world of
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.440]   unhappiness.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.720]   We see the great statesmen and others grappling with the problems and failing.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.840]   What's Christianity about?
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.280]   What's the church here for?
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.600]   Is it to tell those people what to do?
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.360]   No, no, it's to say this.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.720]   God has done something.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.400]   God has sent his Son into the world.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   Let's look at his person.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.360]   Oh, how the apostle Paul rejoiced in doing this very thing.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.880]   I read those great verses to you at the beginning.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.760]   Let me read them again.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.680]   And as I read them, my friend, I'm going to test you.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.480]   If you are not thrilled by hearing what I'm going to read, I don't see how you have any
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.840]   right to claim that you're a Christian.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:34.400]   Verse 15, "Who is the image of the invisible God?"
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.960]   He is the image of the invisible God.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.920]   He is the firstborn of every creature, of all creation, if you like.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:50.600]   For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:56.120]   invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.440]   All things were created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.040]   things consist.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.280]   They all hold together.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.400]   If he disappeared, they'd all vanish and disintegrate.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.000]   And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.800]   dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:23.160]   For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.040]   That's the person we are speaking of.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.280]   Listen to what he says about him in the second chapter.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:33.560]   Verse 3, "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.880]   Listen to it in verse 9.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:44.320]   "For in him," this is Jesus of Nazareth, "in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead."
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   That is him.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   That's who he is.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:53.000]   That's his answer to these people who talk about the intermediaries and Jesus being but
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   one of them.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.240]   That's the answer to the man today who says, "I believe Jesus was a good man.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.920]   I believe he's the greatest religious teacher the world has ever known.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   I like his life.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   I like this and that."
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.480]   But it doesn't go any further.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.680]   The answer is, "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:16.480]   In other words, this is our message, that the eternal Son of God has entered into this
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:23.880]   world, that the babe of Bethlehem was the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.720]   was everlasting God.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:33.520]   That all the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in that infant body.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.440]   Now then, that is why I say it's a proclamation.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.120]   It is thrilling good news.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.560]   Proclamation, new king, new queen, wonderful.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.760]   But listen, the King of Heaven has come down.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.120]   That's what the Christian church means.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.460]   That's why we are here tonight.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.600]   It's because of this thing that happened 1962 years ago.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.120]   God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.640]   God has done this thing.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.880]   The Son of God has been in this world.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.760]   Is that to you the most thrilling thing you've ever heard?
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:08.120]   That's what Christianity is about, this person.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.960]   The incarnation, God becoming man, the Word being made flesh and dwelling among us, taking
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   unto him human nature, living, teaching, all I say, the miracles and all these manifestations
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.480]   of his power, and then the cross, the death, the burial, and then the amazing fact of the
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.800]   resurrection, his appearances unto his people, his ascension unto heaven.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.280]   Whom we preach, that's the Apostle's message.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.360]   That's what he went round the world proclaiming, that the Son of God has been in this world.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.560]   Yes, but you see, the important thing to understand is this.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.400]   What's the significance of all this?
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.800]   Someone may say to me, "All right, I've always known that.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.480]   I was taught when I was a child that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, but I don't
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.040]   see that it has any relevance to me.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.080]   I don't see what application it has to my life and to my way of living and to my whole
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.600]   cause in this world.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   What's the meaning?
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.800]   What's the relevance of it all?"
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.920]   Well, here's the Apostle's answer.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.600]   Whom we preach, warning every man.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.920]   Warning.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.800]   What's he warning them about?
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.400]   That's how the Apostle preached his gospel.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.840]   It started always with a warning.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.400]   Indeed, all gospel starts with a warning.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.600]   The first preacher in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and he was a man who had
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   a warning.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.920]   He looked at certain people who came to listen to him and said, "Who hath warned you to
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   Warning.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   Our Lord Jesus Christ preached in exactly the same way.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.640]   Repent, he says, believe the gospel.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   Flee.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.120]   The Apostle Peter, the first preacher, under the auspices of the Christian church as we
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.920]   know her, preaching on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, this is what he thundered forth,
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.320]   "Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:04.640]   What's the meaning of the last book in the Bible, the book of Revelation?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.000]   Oh, it's a great warning of something that's going to happen.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Warning.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.640]   My dear friend, the greatest need of the world, of every man in the world tonight, is this
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   warning.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.400]   Well, what do we need to be warned of?
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.320]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.960]   The judgment of God.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.000]   This is what the Apostle preached.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.640]   He said, "I have a message for every man and woman in the whole world, and the message
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.200]   is this.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.040]   God has made you and your world and not you yourselves.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.160]   You're proud of yourselves and your knowledge and your achievements, but it's God's world.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.120]   God has made you.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.280]   Whether you know it or not, whether you believe it or not, he has made you and you're responsible
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   to him.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.560]   He's given you certain powers and certain abilities, not that you may consume them on
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.640]   yourselves, not that you may yield to them and enjoy yourselves.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.760]   God made man in his own image and for his own glory, and the object of the creation
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.440]   of men was that God might be glorified.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.680]   Man is set in this world to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.480]   God has made this quite clear in his commandments.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.320]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:26.880]   and all thy strength."
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.200]   We are all under God and we are all responsible to God.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.800]   And we will, every one of us, have to give an account of ourselves to God.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.480]   Warning every man.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.600]   Your great philosopher has got to stand before God like everybody else.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.760]   Your utter ignoramus, he's got to stand in the same place exactly.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.560]   That's the message of this book from the very beginning to the very end.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.120]   But you say, "Where does Jesus Christ come in?
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.600]   How does Jesus Christ and the truth about him come to me as a warning?"
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.400]   Oh, I'll tell you quite simply.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.440]   Why did Jesus Christ ever come into this world?
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.600]   Why did the incarnation ever take place?
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.200]   Why did that most amazing thing that's ever happened, that that babe of Bethlehem contains
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.400]   the whole fullness of the Godhead, what's it mean?
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.880]   And there's only one answer.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   He gave it himself.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:27.000]   He said, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.960]   You see, John 3, 16, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   Wonderful, but why did he do it?
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.640]   "Oh, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish."
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.360]   Perish.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.040]   The danger is the danger of perishing.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.240]   My dear friend, you and I, we are not merely animals, we are not merely bodies and a certain
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.160]   amount of reason and mind.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.200]   We are more than that.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   We have a soul.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.960]   We are related to God.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.520]   And when we go out of this life, we stand before God who made us, the judge of all the
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.240]   earth and give an account of what we've done with the gifts that he's given us.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.560]   That's what makes life such a tremendous thing.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.360]   And that's the tragedy of this present time.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.800]   Nobody's thinking about that.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.000]   Common market, oh, how are we going to do?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.360]   Are we going to do better or worse?
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.720]   How can I get more money and do less work at the same time?
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.080]   How can I get more pleasure?
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.000]   These are the things everybody's thinking about.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.760]   But the thing to think about is this, that every one of us is only here on a very temporary
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   lease.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.680]   Brief life is here our portion.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.120]   We don't know how long we're going to be here.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.400]   Let me tell you something.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.920]   I believe my dear friend would be glad that I should be saying it.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:48.600]   You heard me praying just now for a young widow and her infant child.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.720]   Very well, let me tell you.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:59.480]   The husband, the father, died last Friday night, a young doctor.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:08.440]   I believe I'm right in saying not yet 30 years of age, with life before him and prospects.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.040]   But there's to be a funeral service to him here at 10.30 next Tuesday morning.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   What's it mean?
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.000]   In the midst of life, we are in death.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.560]   Suddenly taken ill.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.560]   Without any warning.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.320]   Dead in a few weeks.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:31.560]   Warning every man, every man, not only those who are tottering on the brink of the grave.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.800]   I'm not preaching only to oxygenarians or non-ogenarians.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.400]   I'm preaching to the child in this congregation, to the youngest member of this congregation.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.760]   I warn you.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.240]   You've got to die and so have I.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.360]   And then what happens?
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.320]   Well, you stand before God in the judgment.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:57.080]   And you will be judged as to what you've done with the gift of the soul which God gave you.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.320]   You'll be judged as to whether you've lived your life to his glory or to your own glory.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.280]   Whether you've lived to please him or to please yourself.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.560]   Warning every man.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.560]   There is a final judgment and we shall be judged according to that standard.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.720]   It's all in the Ten Commandments, the moral law, what God has depicted as the kind of
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.240]   life he wants men to live.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.640]   We've all got to face it.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:25.400]   And listen, there is a verdict delivered in that judgment.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.200]   And it's one of two and there are only two.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:37.900]   We all of us, as the result of that judgment, either go on to spend eternity in the presence
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:45.440]   of God and in the glory and with the holy angels, or we spend it in eternal misery and
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.720]   wretchedness and unhappiness.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720]   That's the teaching.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.920]   Warning every man.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   Christ said it.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.360]   It isn't Paul's idea.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.640]   He talked about that place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.480]   There is a hell, my friends.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.840]   Whatever the modern man may say, he's only speculating.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.040]   He doesn't know.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.120]   The Son of God said there is a hell.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.640]   So the apostle warns every man, every one of us has got to die and face God.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.560]   And it's one of those two ends, heaven or hell.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:25.760]   Joy and bliss indescribable, or misery and wretchedness that are too awful to contemplate.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   Warning every man.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:33.480]   I say again, it doesn't matter who you are, nor what you are, nor what you know, nor how
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.680]   much money you have, nor what your learning is, nor what your prospects are.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   You've got to come to this.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   Every man of you.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   And I with you.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:49.800]   But thank God our message doesn't stop at a warning.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.080]   It does start with it.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.880]   People say nobody comes to Christ these days.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.480]   I'll tell you why nobody comes to Christ.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.160]   They see no need of him.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.400]   They say they've got all they want.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.680]   But certain sloppy sentimental people listen to the appeal, come to Christ, listen to any
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   appeal.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.320]   But says a man, I don't need it, I'm all right.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   Are you?
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.520]   When you realize my friend that you've got to face that eternal God in the judgment,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.560]   well then you'll begin to see your need of Christ.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.160]   And then you'll listen to the teaching.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.040]   Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   What is it?
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.840]   It's the wisdom of God.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.120]   It's this teaching about the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.240]   Why did he come into the world?
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.080]   He came into the world to save us.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   He came into the world for this reason, that face to face with God and his judgment we're
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   all lost.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   We're all undone.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.240]   We're all damned.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.220]   The most moral man is an utter miserable failure.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.720]   He hasn't done this, that and the other.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.640]   No, nobody has lived to the glory of God.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   He doesn't know God.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   He hasn't thought of God.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:56.800]   He's as damned a sinner as the greatest drunkard or prostitute in London.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.720]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.080]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   Teaching all men.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.360]   Oh, what a privilege it is to teach you this old, old teaching.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360]   Here's the teaching.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.840]   Jesus of Nazareth, this Son of God in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.360]   Why did he come into the world?
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360]   He came to save us.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.560]   How does he save us?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.260]   Here's the teaching.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.260]   By dying for us.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.440]   Did you notice it in the reading?
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.120]   For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell, and having made peace
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.840]   through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.360]   By him I say whether they be things in earth or things that in heaven, and you that were
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:40.220]   sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now were they reconciled
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:47.320]   in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   in his sight.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   Teaching.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.600]   Here's the blessed teaching.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.320]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.400]   The Son of God took on him human nature in order that he might be our representative.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.080]   That's the only way to deliver us.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.180]   He made himself one of us in order that he might deliver us.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.180]   What did he do then?
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.860]   Well, he took our sins upon him.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.520]   He made himself responsible for our position.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.720]   That's why this is a thrilling good news.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.240]   Here am I lost and damned, dying, facing God and knowing I'm going to hell.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.740]   I can do nothing about it.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.480]   It's no use my saying I'll live a better life.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.880]   My best will be unworthy, and God is perfect.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.240]   I must live entirely to him.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   I can do nothing.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.840]   I'm completely helpless.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:33.320]   Suddenly I'm told that God's own Son has taken all my failure and guilt and shame upon him,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:39.080]   has taken my punishment, has died my death, and thereby has satisfied the demands of God's
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.440]   law and God is ready to forgive me freely.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.540]   That's it.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.540]   That's the teaching.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.440]   But this is God's way of saving us.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.680]   This is God's way of reconciling men unto himself.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.960]   There was no other way.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.000]   If there had been, this would never have happened.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.600]   Think of the Son of God leaving the everlasting glory, coming down into a world like this
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.720]   of sin and shame and unhappiness and sharing our life and dying that awful death.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   Why does he do it?
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   Oh, it's the only way whereby he can save us and he did it.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:20.640]   And so the blessed teaching is just this, that the only way to be saved, to be forgiven,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.680]   is to believe this message, to believe on the Son of God.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.760]   Justification by faith only.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.240]   No man's works will ever save him.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.600]   All your good deeds are not enough.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.560]   Could my zeal now respite now?
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.360]   Could my tears forever flow?
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.720]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.000]   Thou must save and thou alone.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.160]   Listen to this most wonderful, this most glorious teaching.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.120]   The best men can't save himself.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.600]   The most learned men will never understand.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   Listen to this.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.800]   Paupers, helpless, people in rags, hopeless failures as we are.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.080]   Listen.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:08.720]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.880]   Whether you've touched the lowest dregs that a man can ever touch in this life or whether
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.880]   you're the most respectable, I'm teaching every man.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.800]   I don't care what your antecedents are.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.560]   I'm telling all that this is the only way and it is a way for all.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.680]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.640]   He died to make us good.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.720]   Justification by faith only.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:40.160]   So all we are called upon to do is this, is to repent, is to realize our state and condition,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.600]   to acknowledge it and to confess it to God and in our utter helplessness believe the
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.760]   message concerning the Son.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.600]   Come to him and say just as I am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me and
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.400]   that thou bidst me come to thee.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.960]   O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   I don't understand.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.160]   Tossed about with many a doubt.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.880]   Come, he says, as you are.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.120]   I'm not asking you to understand.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.920]   I'm asking you to believe.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.120]   Look at me.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   All the ends of the earth and be ye saved.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.440]   That's all, he says.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.640]   I'm not asking for your ability and wisdom.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.320]   I'm asking you to come as you are in need and helplessness and to believe that I've
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:23.000]   loved you and died for you and that I reconcile you to the Father.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.200]   Teaching every man in all wisdom and what's the object of it all?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.080]   Let me just tell you in a final word.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.080]   That whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that, in
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.800]   order that, what?
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:44.000]   We may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.680]   What a wonderful thing this is.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.520]   You see, it doesn't merely mean forgiveness.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.800]   Oh, it does mean that I'm not appreciating that God forbid that I should.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.680]   If we are not forgiven, well then we are completely helpless.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.920]   If we are not forgiven, we go automatically to hell.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.520]   Forgiveness is absolutely essential, but it isn't all.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.580]   It's merely the beginning.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.800]   To believe this message doesn't merely mean that your sins are forgiven tonight and then
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.040]   you go back and out into the world and go on living as you were before and go on sinning
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.080]   and then confessing and being forgiven and back and forth.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   No, no.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.640]   That I may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   Present?
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   When?
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.280]   Oh, at this last judgment, you see.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.600]   That's a part of this great and glorious gospel.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:43.400]   I do all this as the apostle in order that at the end I may present all who believe this
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:49.720]   message, all who receive the teaching, I may present them perfect without spot or wrinkle
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:55.280]   or any such thing in the presence of God and his eternal glory.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.400]   Did you notice how he'd been saying that before?
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.720]   To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.120]   which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.360]   I must tell you something about this.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.560]   This is a very important and thrilling part of the teaching.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   We are in this old troubled decaying world, change and decay in all around I see.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.920]   A world of war and shame and sin and bloodshed.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.640]   Throughout the running centuries men have been trying to improve it and make it a better
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.000]   place but it gets worse and worse.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Is there no hope?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.320]   Well, there isn't from the standpoint of men but there is from the standpoint of this
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.120]   teaching concerning this blessed person.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.400]   Why did Christ come into the world?
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.160]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.560]   It's because this is God's world.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.040]   He didn't merely come to save us as individuals.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.560]   He's going to reconcile all things unto God which are in heaven and on earth and under
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.720]   the earth there's to be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:01.040]   the glory, the hope of glory, the glory which is to come.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.000]   This is the marvelous thing.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.440]   You see, we go on forever and forever.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.160]   As I said, it's either heaven or hell and it's eternal.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:16.040]   And my object, says Paul, is to prepare these people who believe this message for heaven
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.880]   and for this glory which is coming.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.100]   It is not merely a message of forgiveness.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.440]   We are not merely delivered from the guilt of sin, we are delivered from the power of
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.800]   sin.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   We are to be made perfect.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.240]   How does he do it?
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.820]   Well, he gives us a new birth.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.620]   He gives us a new life.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.560]   He gives us a new nature.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.280]   He gives us a new power in the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.300]   That's the program of Christianity.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.640]   We are just being prepared for this amazing glory that is coming when the Son of God comes
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   back again.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.320]   He'll rout all his enemies.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.680]   He'll banish all evil out of sight.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.520]   There'll be a great purging of the whole cosmos.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:09.000]   And there shall be this final regeneration, this renovation of the whole universe.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   It'll be handed back to God as it was in its original perfection.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.440]   And all who believe this message will be in that glory and will spend their eternity in
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.680]   it, the hope of glory.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:27.440]   So says the apostle, "I warn every man and I teach every man in all wisdom in order that
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.000]   I may present every man perfect.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.160]   I'm preparing them for the glory," says Paul.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.400]   This is not the only world.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.240]   This is a comparatively unimportant one.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.800]   This is but a preparatory school.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.640]   This is but a stage of preparation.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.880]   That's the world that's coming.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.920]   This is a doomed world.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   This is a damned and a condemned world.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.560]   The world that is coming is the world of glory.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:51.800]   Because I'm preparing men, every man, for it who believes this message.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:45:00.720]   Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:07.520]   That is the Christian message according to the apostle Paul.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.360]   It is for every man.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.280]   What of you, my friend?
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.000]   Have you heard the warning?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.080]   Have you believed it?
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.400]   Have you paid heed to it?
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:34.200]   Had you realized that you have got to die and face God in the judgment in these terms?
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   Have you realized it?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.880]   That's the warning.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.160]   It may come at any moment.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.080]   Have you paid heed to it?
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   Have you repented?
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.120]   Have you expressed your sorrow to God?
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.960]   Have you turned away from all that and turned to God, giving yourself to him?
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:53.400]   Have you heard the warning?
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.880]   Have you believed the teaching concerning the Lord of glory who came down to earth to
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.960]   die for you?
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.320]   Are you trusting utterly and absolutely and only to the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320]   tonight?
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:14.360]   Have you completely ceased to rely upon yourself and your good works and your good ideas and
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.060]   all your good motives?
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:22.160]   Have you said, quite honestly meaning it, "Nothing in my hands I bring.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.800]   Simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.360]   Helpless look to thee for grace.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:35.000]   Foul I to the fountain fly.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.360]   Wash me, Savior, or I die."
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:49.800]   Are you trusting entirely and only to what the Son of God has done for you and believing
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   that?
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.120]   Are you preparing for the glory that is coming?
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.480]   If ever a man needed to ask that question from a Christian pulpit, it is now.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   When is it coming?
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.600]   It may come at any moment, I do not know.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:09.940]   But everything seems to be pointing that we are hurtling on to an end.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.880]   If you believe this message, you will give proof of it.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.240]   You will be preparing yourself for that glory.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:23.560]   The apostle John puts it like this, "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.400]   even as he is pure."
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.000]   The man who has heard and believed the warning, the man who has accepted the teaching, the
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.880]   man who believes that the Son of God so loved him that he left heaven and literally died
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.320]   for him, that cruel death, is a man who says, "I am not my own.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.000]   I have been bought with a price.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.440]   I must yield myself to him, body, soul, and spirit."
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:48.280]   He gives himself to preparation for the glory that is yet to come, that "I may present
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:54.120]   every man perfect in Christ Jesus."
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.400]   But what a glorious prospect!
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.040]   Are you rejoicing in it tonight?
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.640]   Are you rejoicing in the thought that a day is coming when your old body even will be
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:07.920]   absolutely pure, free from sin and every stain and every taint of sin, free from illness,
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:15.200]   free from weakness, a glorified body in a glorified spirit dwelling in a glorified universe?
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:22.680]   That is the thing that is offered to all who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   of God.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:32.720]   You see, when a man believes that, he really does mean this, doesn't he?
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:42.360]   "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great Redeemer's praise!
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.120]   He breaks the power of cancelled sin.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.220]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.760]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.480]   His blood availed for me."
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.640]   The moment you believe it, you see, there is nothing else that is of value.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   There is nothing else worth singing about.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.240]   But He is worthy of it all and infinitely more.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   A thousand tongues are not enough.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:13.000]   This Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me and who is preparing me for the glory
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:23.280]   everlasting world without end, warning every man, teaching every man that we may present
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.840]   every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.240]   My dear friend, are you in the company?
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:36.280]   Very well, if you are, you'll be very ready to sing this last hymn, the hymn number 166.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.640]   "Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne."
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   Hymn number 166.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:50:07.320]   "Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:34.040]   The Lamb upon His throne."
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:51:02.240]   "Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:30.440]   The Lamb upon His throne."
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:58.640]   "Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:26.840]   The Lamb upon His throne."
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:55.040]   "Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:23.240]   The Lamb upon His throne."
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:51.440]   "Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:54:08.640]   The Lamb upon His throne."
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.960]   I didn't tell you the most wonderful thing about my dear friend whose mortal remains
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.440]   are to be buried on Tuesday, the young doctor.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:26.280]   He was given the verdict by other doctors a fortnight ago that his liver was riddled
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.860]   with cancer.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.560]   And being a doctor, he knew exactly what that meant.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.360]   But he wrote to a friend and threw the friend to me just saying this.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.240]   He said, "At first I was staggered, but immediately God gave me that peace of His
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.820]   which passeth all understanding.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:52.080]   I know," he said, "that this just means for me going to be in the glory."
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:56.320]   He said, "I am nevertheless prepared to say that if it be God's will that I remain
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:01.560]   a little longer in this world and do some service for God, I am ready even to submit
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.160]   to that and forgo the joys of the glory for a few years.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.520]   But whichever it is, I am in God's hands."
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.000]   He had heard the warning.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.040]   When he came up to London as a student, he wasn't a Christian.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.040]   He had heard the warning.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.040]   He had believed it.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.600]   He had listened to the teaching.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.960]   He had accepted it.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.200]   He was preparing himself for the glory.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.560]   So when the stunning blow comes, he is ready.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:37.880]   He knows that death just means going to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.700]   Are you like that?
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.120]   You can be.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:48.800]   He simply believed this message, and that is the glorious result to which it leads.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:57.280]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be he saved.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:05.240]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:10.240]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:16.760]   Now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour, short and certain, earthly life
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.520]   and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.360]   Amen.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:29.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
