[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.300]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.260]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.700]   Today, we are discussing caffeine.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.020]   Caffeine is one of the most widely used substances
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.380]   on the planet.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.020]   Estimates are that more than 90% of adults
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.660]   and as many as 50% of kids,
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.420]   that is adolescents and teenagers,
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.340]   use caffeine on a daily basis.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560]   Caffeine is an amazing molecule.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.820]   Most people are familiar with caffeine's ability
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.980]   to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.260]   of sleepiness and fatigue, and indeed it does that.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.220]   But what most people are not aware of
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220]   is that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.440]   What I mean by reinforcer is that when caffeine is present
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.580]   in a drink or food, and yes, indeed,
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.380]   caffeine is present in many foods, even unbeknownst to us,
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.380]   when it's present in drinks and foods,
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.620]   we actively come to like those foods and drinks more
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.780]   than if caffeine were not contained
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.360]   in those foods and drinks.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.020]   So it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks,
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.900]   and indeed, it even reinforces our liking
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.560]   of the containers they are consumed from
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.580]   and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.200]   that contain caffeine.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.900]   That is, caffeine is not just a stimulant,
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.140]   caffeine is a reinforcer, and it's a reinforcer
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.180]   that plays an active role in almost everybody's daily life.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.380]   We can say that with confidence,
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.020]   because as I mentioned a moment ago,
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.500]   more than 90% of people are consuming caffeine,
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.780]   and most people think that they consume caffeine
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780]   because it makes them feel more alert.
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.540]   But there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine,
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.860]   and I'm not going to tell you
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.720]   that consuming caffeine isn't necessarily bad.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.980]   In fact, today I'm going to tell you
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.020]   about many of the positive health benefits of caffeine,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.660]   including neuroprotective effects,
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.060]   antidepressant effects,
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.340]   and certainly performance-enhancing effects,
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.980]   both for mental performance and for physical performance.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.820]   Now, that said, there are certain situations
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.280]   in which you want to avoid caffeine,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.900]   and there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.980]   That's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.300]   not just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.940]   In fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.400]   that if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.180]   in certain foods and drinks,
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.980]   you will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.460]   over other choices, which can be a good thing or a bad thing,
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.480]   depending on what sorts of food and drink choices
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.320]   you're trying to make.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.060]   So today I'm going to inform you
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.740]   about how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.340]   I promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.300]   and such that even if you don't have a background in biology
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.820]   you will be able to digest that information easily.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.740]   And then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.780]   or conversely, how to avoid caffeine at certain times
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.900]   to your advantage.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.340]   So today's episode will focus both on mechanisms
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.780]   and tools that is the use and leverage of caffeine
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.660]   to improve mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.200]   Before we go any further into today's discussion,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.480]   I want to tell you about some recent results
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.820]   about a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.220]   beverages and that has been proven to be very useful
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.740]   for both weight loss, mental performance
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.780]   and controlling blood sugar levels.
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.440]   And that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide one.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.680]   Glucagon-like peptide one is found in the brain and body.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440]   It acts both on the brain and body.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.520]   It does many different things,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.160]   but one of its primary effects that's been discovered
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.960]   is to reduce hunger and it does that two ways.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.300]   It does that by activating certain neurons
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.280]   in your hypothalamus.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.300]   So that's a brain region that controls hunger and satiety.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.800]   It makes us feel full at the level of the brain.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.720]   So it makes us feel sated that is,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.920]   and it actually makes us feel full.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.280]   Turns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.320]   to make us feel as if we've ingested enough food.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.960]   It doesn't necessarily make us feel
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.920]   as if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   That's really interesting because if you think about it,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.860]   when we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously,
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.720]   and that information has to be communicated to the brain
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.520]   such that the brain can then send satiety signals
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.240]   that actually shut off our hunger.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.660]   And believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.160]   to reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.520]   And GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.840]   to create these feelings of satiety as if we've had enough
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.120]   and to reduce our desire to eat more.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.240]   And GLP-1 acts directly on the gut
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.080]   to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.640]   which then is communicated to the brain.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.120]   So really there are two parallel signals being sent
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   when we have GLP-1 present in our system.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.720]   Now, a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.840]   it was actually discovered in Gila monsters.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.320]   These are these reptiles that can go long periods of time
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.000]   without eating, and a very clever scientist
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.120]   decided to study why it is that certain animals
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.540]   like Gila monsters can go a long period of time
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.640]   without ingesting anything.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   And it's because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.520]   They isolate the peptide from GLP-1,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.540]   then they looked for the analogous peptide in humans,
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.160]   and it turns out that does exist.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.360]   And as I mentioned, it's released in both brain and body
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.600]   to make you feel full and sated.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.740]   Why am I telling you all this?
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.460]   Well, today we're going to talk about caffeine,
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.520]   and there's one particular caffeine source,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.840]   which is yerba mate, and there's some other forms of teas,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.240]   similar to yerba mate,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.920]   that stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.540]   There are also nowadays drugs,
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.160]   which are called analogs of GLP-1.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.340]   So these are drugs that mimic or are identical
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.060]   to the kind of GLP-1 that you would make,
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.840]   and those drugs are proving to be very effective
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.000]   for the treatment of certain forms of diabetes
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.820]   and for the treatment of obesity,
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.040]   but they trigger enormous amounts
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   of GLP-1 pathway activation.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.880]   So those are extreme cases for people
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.480]   that are really struggling for weight loss,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.280]   but the clinical trials and the data that are out there
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.760]   in the general population now are very, very promising
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.920]   for GLP-1 analogs.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.800]   Yerba mate tea, provided it's not the smoked variety,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.220]   and I mention that because a number of people
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.480]   have cued me to the fact that yerba mate teas
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   come in smoked varieties and non-smoked varieties,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.720]   and the smoked varieties are thought to perhaps
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.040]   be carcinogenic, that is pro-cancer causing.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.200]   So I advise people to avoid smoked varieties
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.600]   of yerba mate tea,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.940]   but yerba mate teas are known to stimulate
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.640]   significant amounts of GLP-1 release,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.160]   and so they can be effective as a weight loss tool,
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   mainly by blunting appetite.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.260]   And again, they do that both at the level of the brain
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.320]   and at the level of the gut.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.060]   Now, all of what I just told you has been known
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.560]   for some period of time,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.640]   but there are a new set of findings that were just published
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.660]   in "Cell Reports Medicine," "Cell Press Journal,"
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.720]   "Excellent Journal," which indicate exactly how it is
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.400]   that GLP-1 stimulates both satiety
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.040]   and can trigger additional weight loss
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.340]   through other mechanisms.
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.520]   And I find the mechanism to be really interesting
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.000]   and actually really important,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.400]   given some other topics we've covered
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.680]   on this podcast before.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.920]   So the basic finding is that GLP-1,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.500]   whether or not it's stimulated through the release
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.400]   of a analog drug that one is prescribed,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.760]   or by drinking yerba mate tea, for instance,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.360]   and stimulate release of your own
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.320]   so-called endogenous GLP-1,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.580]   yes, it makes you feel more full
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.720]   at the level of brain and body,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.020]   but it turns out it also stimulates thermogenesis.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.040]   Now, thermogenesis is the active utilization
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.760]   of more metabolic energy.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.320]   And fat cells, in particular,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   so-called beige and brown fat cells,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.320]   are a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.360]   The basic background is that you have white adipose cells,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.840]   so white fat cells, you have beige fat cells,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.680]   and you have brown fat cells.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.080]   And the beige and brown ones are fat cells
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.360]   that you actually want more of.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.960]   They are not abundant under your skin.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.540]   They're abundant really around your clavicles
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.480]   and your upper neck.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.200]   They are the ones that generate heat,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.800]   and the beige and brownness of them
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.920]   is actually the consequence
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.760]   of having a lot of mitochondria in those cells.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.960]   When GLP-1 is elevated in your system,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.680]   it turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.720]   and helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.320]   That is, it takes fat cells
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.960]   that are not doing anything useful for you
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.440]   except being stored energy,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.480]   and I think most people out there
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.720]   would like to have fewer of those white adipose cells.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.560]   There are a few of you out there
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.680]   that actually need more of them
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.160]   that are too thin, too lean,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.600]   but most people are suffering
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.980]   from having too many of these white adipose cells.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.580]   Well, when you ingest Yerba Mate tea,
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.320]   or you were to take a GLP-1 analog
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.520]   or stimulate GLP-1 in any number of different ways,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.480]   yes, you stimulate increased satiety,
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.440]   but you're also stimulating the conversion
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.180]   of these white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells,
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.500]   which makes you more thermogenic,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.800]   and over time raises your basal metabolic rate,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.820]   so you're burning more calories even at rest.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.040]   It also makes you feel as if you're more comfortable
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.900]   in colder environments at rest.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.300]   This is very much the same as the mechanism
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.980]   that's induced when you were to, say,
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.260]   take a cold shower or do regular ice baths
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.940]   or get into cold water regularly.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.700]   That too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.560]   to beige and brown fat cells.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.860]   So I like these findings very much
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.860]   because they provide a mechanistic coherence.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.300]   They provide, that is, a really nice story
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.140]   as to how something like GLP-1
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.060]   could be so effective for weight loss.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.500]   Yes, on the one hand, GLP-1 is reducing appetite,
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.980]   and that of course will help people maintain or lose weight,
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.340]   but it's also increasing basal metabolic rate,
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.780]   and we now know how that's accomplished.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.120]   It's likely accomplished at least through this one mechanism
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.740]   by the stimulation of conversion of these white fat cells,
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.500]   which don't do much for us except as energy storage units,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.140]   to these metabolically mitochondrial-rich
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.820]   beige and brown fat cells,
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.060]   which you can think of as sort of the oil in the candle
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.460]   that allows your furnace, your metabolism to burn
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.580]   at a higher temperature and a higher rate.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.740]   So that's the mechanism, and the basic tool takeaway
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.940]   is that if you are somebody who's interested
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.980]   in losing weight and you want to leverage the GLP-1 pathway,
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.940]   drinking a cup or two of Yerba Mate tea early in the day
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.480]   would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.380]   There are other ways to stimulate GLP-1 release.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.220]   You can get it through certain forms of exercise,
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.720]   in particular fasted exercise.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.120]   This is actually a vote in favor of fasted exercise.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.880]   There's a debate as to whether or not fasted cardio
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.660]   burns more fat than non-fasted cardio,
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.860]   and the data basically say, no, it doesn't really matter,
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.980]   but that doesn't really take into account
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.420]   the longer arc of things like GLP-1 release,
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.220]   so that needs to be taken into consideration.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.500]   So you could do fasted cardio,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.320]   you could drink Yerba Mate tea,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.700]   keeping in mind that Yerba Mate tea does contain caffeine.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.520]   We'll talk more about the specific forms of stimulants,
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.320]   including caffeine that Mate has,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.840]   but Mate would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.800]   And then of course, for those of you that are interested
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.360]   in more robust activation of GLP-1,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.880]   then perhaps you might want to consider
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.040]   some of the new prescription GLP-1 analogs
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.860]   that are out there,
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.160]   but that's a more severe stimulus for GLP-1, of course.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.780]   And for everybody, regardless of whether or not
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.320]   you're trying to lose weight, gain weight or maintain weight,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.000]   I think we're going to be hearing a lot more
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.440]   about GLP-1 analogs and drinks and supplements
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.880]   and things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   in the very near future because it does appear
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.880]   to be a very important biological mechanism.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.520]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.360]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.440]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.000]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.760]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.880]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.600]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.520]   Our first sponsor is Levels.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.040]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.460]   how different foods affect your health
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.480]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.760]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.460]   Now blood glucose or blood sugar is a critical aspect
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.960]   of your immediate and long-term health
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.680]   and indeed your feelings of vigor and mental clarity
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.120]   and wellbeing at any moment.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.140]   One of the key things is to know how different foods
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.080]   and food combinations and timing of food intake
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.800]   is impacting blood glucose.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.680]   And with Levels, you're able to assess
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.900]   all of that in real time.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.260]   I tried Levels and what it taught me, for instance,
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.940]   was that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day,
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.740]   but if I eat them at other times of day,
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.480]   I get a blood sugar crash.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.860]   It also taught me, for instance,
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.960]   how to space my exercise and my food intake.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.240]   Turns out for me, exercising fasted is far more beneficial.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.020]   That's something I learned using Levels
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.600]   and it's completely transformed,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.140]   not just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise,
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.520]   but also use of things like the sauna and other activities.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.500]   It's been a tremendous learning for me
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.520]   that's really shaped an enormous number of factors
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.680]   in my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.060]   with far more mental focus
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.580]   and physical strength and endurance.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.340]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.740]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.100]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.800]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.420]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.540]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.420]   I've talked many times on this podcast
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.700]   about the critical relationship
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.180]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.200]   That is, in order to fall asleep
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.180]   and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.560]   our body temperature needs to drop
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.460]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.140]   And conversely, when we wake up in the morning,
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.300]   that is in large part because of our body heating up
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.000]   by one to three degrees.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.940]   Now, people have different core body temperatures
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.540]   and they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.520]   Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.800]   of your sleeping environment
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.420]   so that you have the optimal temperature
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.380]   that gets you the best night's sleep.
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.260]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.420]   about eight months ago
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.740]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.600]   I sleep so much deeper.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.640]   I wake up far less during the middle of the night,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.060]   if at all, and I wake up feeling far better
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.220]   than I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.060]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.060]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.320]   to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday Bundle,
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.680]   which includes their new Pod 3 cover.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.940]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.580]   United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.300]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.920]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.180]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.220]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.820]   from Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.760]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.520]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.420]   the visual system,
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.780]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.300]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.140]   in order for you to see clearly, for instance,
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.380]   when you move from a sunny area
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.220]   to a shady area and back again,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.740]   whether or not you're looking at something up close
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.020]   or off into the distance.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.380]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.140]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.420]   so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.400]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.860]   for activities such as running and cycling,
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.400]   and indeed they are very lightweight.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.780]   Most of the time I can't even remember
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.820]   that they're on my face, they're so lightweight.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.940]   But the important thing to know
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.580]   about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.220]   is that while they can be used during sports activities,
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.100]   they also have a terrific aesthetic
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.980]   and they can be used just as well for wearing to work
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.020]   or out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.460]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.300]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com

[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.820]   on your first order.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.060]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.220]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.940]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.180]   with Momentus Supplements.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.500]   To find the supplements we discussed
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.740]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.340]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.700]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.300]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.500]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.580]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.620]   Let's talk about caffeine.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.620]   So as I mentioned earlier, caffeine is consumed
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.540]   by basically most all adults every single day
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.660]   and consumed at very regular times each day.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.760]   In fact, if you were to take a look at your caffeine intake
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.020]   or the caffeine intake of somebody close to you,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.380]   what you would realize is that they don't do so well
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.900]   if their caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.640]   or 30 minutes past their expected
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.980]   or usual intake of caffeine.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.300]   That's pretty remarkable.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.660]   And it brings to mind ideas
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.520]   that we are all quote unquote addicted to caffeine
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.820]   or that caffeine is somehow bad.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.440]   I'm certainly not going to make the argument
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.460]   that caffeine is bad.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.460]   First of all, I'm a regular caffeine user.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.120]   I wouldn't call myself a caffeine abuser
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.980]   but I am a regular caffeine user.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.960]   And caffeine is known to have certain health benefits.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.760]   I listed off a few of them earlier
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.420]   but I'll mention those again now before going forward.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.300]   Caffeine is known to have certain neuroprotective effects
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.100]   and that is because of its ability
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.540]   to increase neuromodulators such as dopamine
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.640]   but also other so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.780]   If you don't know what those names mean,
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.420]   these are molecules that increase levels of alertness,
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.780]   motivation and drive.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.640]   And so then therefore not surprisingly,
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.960]   the large scale analysis of the relationship
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.660]   between depression and caffeine
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.200]   shows that provided people are not drinking so much caffeine
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.740]   that it makes them overly anxious,
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.000]   that regular intake of caffeine is inversely related
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.380]   to levels of depression.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.600]   So it may have some antidepressant effects
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.200]   and those could be direct or indirect.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.040]   What do I mean by that?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.920]   Well, you can imagine that if people are ingesting caffeine
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.000]   and they are more motivated to do work
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.280]   and pursue quality social interactions,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.980]   then the probability that they will have depression
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.600]   could be lower.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.620]   It could also be that there are direct effects
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.540]   on the chemical systems of the brain
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.820]   that relate to mood and wellbeing
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.920]   that could offset depression.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.260]   It is not clear whether or not the effects of caffeine
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.700]   in countering depression are direct or indirect.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.500]   Nonetheless, there's a relationship there
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.640]   and it's an interesting and positive one
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.020]   or I should say negative correlation,
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.020]   positive effect overall on mood and wellbeing to be exact.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.120]   Now it's also the case that caffeine can improve mental
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.640]   performance and physical performance.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.960]   This has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.600]   I will review a few studies on this in particular today,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.880]   but to just give you a sense of how caffeine works
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.560]   at the level of its timing and impact on mental performance
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.880]   and physical performance.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.120]   When we ingest caffeine,
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.000]   provided that we don't have a lot of food in our stomach
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.280]   and that our blood sugar isn't particularly high,
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.880]   generally we experience an increase in alertness
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.160]   within about five minutes
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.800]   and that increase in focus and alertness peaks
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.480]   around 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.280]   and persists for as long as 60 minutes.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.160]   Now this is assuming that one takes caffeine in pill form
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.080]   or drinks the entire caffeine drink
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.720]   within a short period of time.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.560]   But a little bit later,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.240]   I'll talk about how you can consume caffeine
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.880]   at regular intervals while doing mental work
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.760]   or physical work in a way that can further
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.680]   increase mental performance and physical performance.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.280]   But let's just touch on what caffeine intake really does
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.000]   for mental performance and physical performance.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.880]   Perhaps the most robust finding
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.020]   across all of the studies that I've examined
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.240]   is that caffeine reduces our reaction time.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.560]   That is, it improves our reaction time.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.220]   It doesn't make it longer, it makes it shorter.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.960]   So for instance, in a laboratory study
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.180]   where people were asked to hit a lever
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.240]   every time they hear a tone,
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.480]   you can greatly reduce the time between the tone
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.120]   and the pressing of the lever
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.240]   if people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.120]   before they do that task.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.560]   Now that seems like a trivial task,
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.840]   but this is also seen in the domain of sports performance
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.740]   and even in cognitive performance
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.400]   where people have to arrive
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.700]   at a particular answer to a question.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.760]   And the answer to that question has to be pulled
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.940]   from their memory banks within their brain,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.280]   their hippocampus, for instance,
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.560]   a brain structure involved in memory.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.000]   And if you are asking people, for instance,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.920]   to remember the capitals of different states or cities
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.020]   or to remember certain historical facts,
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.960]   they will do that at a particular rate.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.780]   But if they've ingested caffeine within the hour prior,
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.020]   their ability to recall that information
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.040]   is much, much better.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.160]   They are faster and it does not appear
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.440]   that accuracy is reduced.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   In fact, in many cases, accuracy is enhanced.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.840]   And that's because caffeine both works
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.400]   on the reaction time systems of the brain and body.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.760]   I'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.920]   but it also stimulates certain neurotransmitters
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.840]   and so-called neuromodulators within the brain and body
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.780]   that give the neural circuits in the brain
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.640]   that are associated with learning and memory
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.840]   a lower threshold to activation.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.660]   What does that mean?
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.600]   That means that we are better able to access
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.300]   the brain circuitry involved in learning and memory
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.040]   when we have a certain amount of caffeine
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.360]   circulating in our system.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.280]   So this makes caffeine
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.420]   an incredible performance-enhancing compound.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.920]   And I could give you tens of thousands
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.400]   of examples of this in humans.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.540]   But before I do that, I want to just touch on
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.020]   what we know about the existence of caffeine in nature
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.460]   and what the existence of caffeine in nature
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.180]   and its effects on other animals
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.540]   tells us about what caffeine does in humans.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.780]   Because as I alluded to earlier,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.420]   what caffeine is doing for us
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.420]   is not just making us more alert, improving our memory,
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.240]   improving our reaction time, and so on.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.720]   It's actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.560]   And it's acting as not just a powerful reinforcer
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.780]   of the caffeine containing drink that we drink,
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.760]   but also the mug that it's contained in,
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.160]   plus the person that we might be sitting across from
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.260]   when we consume that caffeine, and so on and so forth.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.500]   If it's a little bit hard for you to conceptualize
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.640]   what a reinforcer is and why I'm calling it a reinforcer,
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.600]   let me spell it out in three specific ways.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.280]   We often hear about the word reward and we think,
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.580]   okay, if we do certain things and we like the outcome,
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.840]   then those certain things are rewarded, right?
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.180]   If we're doing something, we receive praise,
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.140]   the praise is the reward,
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.600]   and therefore we are more likely
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.460]   to do that thing in the future.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.360]   In fact, a lot of parenting is like that
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   and a lot of life is like that.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.040]   However, when we hear the word reward,
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.780]   we often think about something that feels good to us.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.260]   And certainly if we've worked hard and we get some praise,
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.300]   that's natural for the praise to feel good to us.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.240]   Or for instance, if we work very hard
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.680]   and we get a certain outcome, a trophy, a financial outcome,
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.000]   a degree outcome, recognition, et cetera,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.460]   all of those can act as rewards,
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.920]   but those are all conscious rewards.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.360]   We are aware that they are happening.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.320]   Reinforcers are a little bit different
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.100]   because the word reinforcement can apply
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.340]   to conscious rewards of the sort that I just described.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.520]   But there are also many ways in which caffeine stimulates
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.360]   the release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers,
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.060]   but those reinforcers are subconscious.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.700]   That is, we are not aware that they cause this preference
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.860]   for the activities that cause their release.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.160]   So the study I'm about to describe beautifully, I believe,
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.360]   encapsulates how is it that humans came to consume caffeine
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.680]   and why caffeine exists in nature
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.280]   and the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing agent,
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.560]   both in animals, insects, and in you and me.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.880]   And the title of the paper is Caffeine and Floral Nectar
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.840]   Enhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.460]   Keep in mind that caffeine is made from plants.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.380]   Some of you will say, duh,
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.700]   but I think some of us don't realize that the reason why
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.980]   there is caffeine in coffee is because coffee comes
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.720]   from a plant, it's a coffee bean, certain teas,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.100]   which of course are plants that people brew,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.200]   caffeine is contained in those teas, such as yerba mate.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.020]   Well, why would this bitter substance,
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.880]   because in fact, caffeine is quite bitter
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.820]   in high concentrations,
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.600]   why would this bitter substance be something
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.080]   that insects or animals would want to consume at all?
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.840]   It turns out that in most plants,
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.640]   caffeine is present in small enough quantities
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.280]   that insects and other animals,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.480]   and in fact, we can't actually taste the caffeine.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.840]   If I were to give you a little bit of pure caffeine,
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.160]   yes, it would be a stimulant for you,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.540]   but you would say that it tasted awful.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.800]   It's in a category of compounds
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.540]   that would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.840]   on your tongue and would make you cringe and pucker
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.380]   and essentially walk away from whatever it is
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.520]   that contained that caffeine,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.800]   and from the experience that contained that caffeine.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.620]   Well, in nature, caffeine is present
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.620]   in very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.420]   within flowers, beans, and plants.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.980]   And what this paper really points to is that caffeine
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.520]   in nature is acting as a reinforcer for bees
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.580]   that are consuming different nectar.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.700]   So the way that it works is that bees, of course,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.820]   go from flower to flower,
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.500]   and they are consuming the nectar.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.620]   They are bringing nectar and pollen back to the hive,
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.620]   and that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.280]   The bees are foraging in a way that includes information
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.220]   about color, in particular, ultraviolet color,
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.720]   things that we can't see, but they can see
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.640]   'cause they have different photoreceptors than we do.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.480]   And what this study shows is that plants and nectars
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.440]   that contain very small amounts of caffeine
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.500]   are the preferred sources of food for bees.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.580]   And the study is beautiful because they were able to confirm
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.480]   that they could mask the caffeine taste,
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.240]   so they know that the bees are not preferring
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.420]   the taste of caffeine, but what they do is they pair caffeine
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.780]   with different food sources for the bees,
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.660]   then they remove the caffeine.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.920]   And what they find is that the bees very strongly
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.360]   prefer flavors that contain caffeine,
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.980]   not because they could taste the caffeine,
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.620]   but rather for the way that those caffeine-containing flavors
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.900]   made the bees feel.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.480]   So how do those caffeine-containing flavors
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.960]   make the bees feel?
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.680]   The same way that they make you and I feel,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.940]   a little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.200]   For the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.860]   which then has a further reinforcing effect.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.240]   So what we're really talking about here is the fact that,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.760]   A, caffeine exists in nature, in plants.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.140]   It exists in concentrations that are very low,
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.320]   so low in fact that they are not detectable
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.280]   to the taste receptors of insects,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.040]   and in many cases to the taste receptors of humans.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.000]   And of course, there can be high levels of caffeine
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.360]   in a plant, but if the plant also contains compounds
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.160]   that mask the flavor of caffeine,
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.200]   well then those plants are going to essentially
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.600]   be even stronger reinforcers for the flavor of the plant.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.440]   So now we're talking about strong flavors
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.380]   plus strong neurostimulant effects of caffeine.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.280]   And the most important point here is that
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.420]   all of these effects of caffeine are subconscious.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.420]   It is not because the bee or you likes the taste of caffeine.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.560]   In fact, most people, when they take their first sip
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.660]   of coffee, they find that it tastes bitter
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.320]   and kind of noxious, they don't like it.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.900]   You may not even remember that
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.280]   because it happened so long ago,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.380]   and because caffeine is such a strong reinforcer
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.420]   that very quickly you come to like the taste of coffee.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.300]   You might even come to like the feeling
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.440]   of your mug in your hand.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.040]   You might even come to like the smell of coffee
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.480]   and so on and so forth.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.120]   And that's because caffeine stimulates the release
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.740]   of certain neurochemicals in the brain,
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.560]   in particular dopamine and acetylcholine,
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.520]   two neuromodulators that increase our focus
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.820]   and alertness and our feelings of wellbeing.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.560]   A little bit later, I'll tell you that caffeine stimulates
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.800]   the release of dopamine in a way that's very much distinct
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.200]   from the classical dopamine pathway associated
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.440]   with addiction and reward.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.640]   In fact, we can think of caffeine
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.080]   as having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.200]   I'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.660]   Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.340]   and acetylcholine, not within the classic
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.000]   so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.220]   That's just fancy nerd speak
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.840]   for the reward pathways of the brain.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.000]   They're associated with things like sex and food
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.920]   and drugs of abuse like cocaine and methamphetamine,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.060]   but rather caffeine seems to stimulate the release
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.680]   of dopamine in the parts of the brain
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.040]   that are associated with alertness and cognition,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.760]   meaning the forebrain.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.240]   This is very important.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.480]   We have multiple dopamine systems in the brain and body,
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.240]   and caffeine seems to stimulate dopamine directly
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.160]   within the components of the brain
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.080]   that are associated with clarity of thought and wellbeing,
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.400]   but more so clarity of thought.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.240]   Now, I'm also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.800]   in that it makes you feel good overall, and it does,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.360]   and that suggests that it also taps
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.180]   into the more classic reward pathway,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.840]   but it does that in a very interesting
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.540]   and frankly almost diabolical way.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.560]   When we regularly ingest caffeine,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.320]   it stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.120]   at multiple sites throughout the brain,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.560]   but in particular within the reward pathways of the brain.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.160]   So not the areas of the brain that are associated
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.540]   with focus and clarity of thought and cognition.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.000]   It does that, but it is also increasing the level
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.500]   of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.600]   And what that means is that for any dopamine
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.100]   that's released in response to a positive experience,
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.840]   social experience, or any number of the other things
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.320]   that can stimulate dopamine release,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.720]   there are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.600]   for that dopamine to arrive at
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   and to exert its increases in mood, increases in motivation,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.560]   and overall feelings of drive and excitement.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.120]   So there are four ways that caffeine works
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.140]   that we need to understand.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.880]   First of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.260]   It increases the probability that you will return to
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.040]   and engage in a certain activity
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.600]   or consume a certain beverage or food.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.360]   Second of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.000]   which are both neuromodulators in the forebrain,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.280]   which helps us improve our ability to think,
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.720]   to modify our rule sets, that is to adjust our strategies
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.480]   for different social situations and mental demands
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.620]   and physical demands.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.080]   And third, it increases the number and efficacy
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.980]   of dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.340]   That is, it makes things that would feel pretty good
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.420]   feel even better.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.080]   And fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine,
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.440]   which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.120]   from the accumulation of adenosine that occurs
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.600]   as we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.700]   So let's talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.040]   Again, this was first most beautifully demonstrated
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.120]   in this study on honeybees where the bees prefer nectars
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.880]   that contain caffeine.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.440]   And that all makes perfect sense in terms of the ecology
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.480]   of bees and flowers that contain nectar.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.240]   There's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation,
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.320]   that the flower benefits because of distribution
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.000]   of things from the flower, which is good for the flowers
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.480]   and the bees benefit because they're getting food.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.240]   And so there's a kind of a symbiosis there.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.360]   But with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.520]   beverages for our sake.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.000]   I don't think we have it in mind,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.740]   nor do the bees have it in mind, frankly,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.160]   that we're trying to preserve the plants
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.680]   that provide the caffeine.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   I think we would all suffer, or I should say 90% of adults
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.640]   would suffer greatly if all the caffeine-containing coffee
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.800]   and tea plants were gone, certainly.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.820]   But most of us are not consuming coffees and teas
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.940]   and caffeine-containing foods because we're thinking
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.100]   about the plants they come from
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.140]   and we want to help those plants.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.240]   We're thinking about how we want to help ourselves.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.160]   And yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.720]   are that they are largely subconscious.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.440]   We are not aware of them.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.000]   Now you might say, no, that's not true.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.080]   When I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.100]   So I'm aware that it makes me feel good.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.480]   In order to illustrate how reinforcement really works,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.640]   let me give you the counter example,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.900]   which would be an aversive agent.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.680]   So we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   Let's say that there were compounds in nature
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.080]   that exist in plants that are aversive, and indeed they are.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.520]   And let's say that these compounds were present
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.920]   at such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.060]   Let's say you wake up in the morning
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.200]   and you go to your refrigerator and you open it up
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.540]   and you are thirsty.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.880]   And so you reach for a nice, you know,
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.680]   rich red containing beverage in a glass jar.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.480]   Maybe it looks like cranberry juice
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.600]   or something of that sort,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.280]   or even a nice clear glass of water.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.120]   It looks like a jug of water, a glass of water,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.700]   and you drink that.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.800]   Tastes fine to you, maybe even tastes great to you.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.960]   And then let's say about 30 minutes later,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.240]   you feel a little queasy, you feel a little off,
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.280]   you feel like going back to sleep.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.880]   You just don't feel very good.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.160]   You don't know why, but your nervous system
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.360]   is a predictive machine and it has a process
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.920]   in which it back integrates, or I should say,
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.940]   integrates backwards into your immediate experience
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.000]   that preceded that not so good feeling.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.600]   We can reliably say that there is a much lower probability
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.440]   that the next day when you wake up,
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.000]   that you would reach for that same beverage
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.320]   or for that same container even.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.500]   And maybe if you're in a novel environment,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.440]   maybe you're staying in an Airbnb or a hotel
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.720]   or something of that sort,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.680]   you might even find that you don't really like the kitchen
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.520]   in which you consume that beverage in the first place.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.300]   And then you don't know why.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.640]   And unless you got very, very sick the day before,
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.200]   it's unlikely that you would have such a strong response
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.920]   that you would entirely avoid, for instance,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.040]   water or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.520]   Let's say you went back to the refrigerator
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.080]   and you consumed beverage again,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.460]   and you just didn't feel so well,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.040]   you felt less good than you normally would.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.960]   Well, even without any ability
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.160]   to taste what's in that beverage,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.940]   and even without any understanding
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.960]   of what was happening to you at a conscious level,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.560]   there is a very, very high probability
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.480]   that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.760]   and certainly at that location
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.140]   and in the same volume in the subsequent days.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.980]   That's just the way that aversive agents work.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.460]   And they work by way of activating neurons in the gut
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.380]   that communicate with areas in the brain
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.200]   that give us this feeling of queasiness.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.220]   And for some of you hearing this,
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.940]   that pathway and that association
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.980]   with times in which you felt queasy
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.460]   and as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.740]   that you might even be feeling
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.560]   some of that symptomology now.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.220]   For certain people, that's going to be increased salivation,
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.700]   which precedes vomiting.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.900]   We know that there's a class of neurons in the brain
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.980]   related to an area called area postrema
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.500]   that actually stimulates vomiting.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.580]   And if I keep talking about this,
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.820]   I'll probably feel like I want to vomit.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.540]   So I'm going to move on from this in a moment.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.280]   So when we ingest caffeine containing beverages and foods,
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.820]   it's the exact opposite scenario as to what I just described.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.780]   Caffeine as a reinforcer makes us feel slightly better
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.920]   or a lot better in the immediate minutes
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.100]   and hours after we ingest it.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.460]   So it's acting as a reinforcing agent,
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.660]   not just while you're under the effects of caffeine,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.700]   but for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine,
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.860]   which is why you return again and again
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.380]   to caffeine containing beverages,
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.900]   such as coffee and tea,
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.200]   or maybe even foods that contain caffeine,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.700]   even if the taste of those foods is not something
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.280]   that you would otherwise consider especially delicious.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.120]   In fact, most people,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.540]   when they take their first sip of coffee or tea
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.300]   or other caffeine containing beverage,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.700]   they find it to be very bitter.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.060]   And that's not because of the taste of caffeine.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.940]   It's because of the taste of the beverage itself,
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.620]   independent of caffeine.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.940]   However, when caffeine is present in there,
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.940]   they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.860]   In fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.700]   will invest a lot of financial resources
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.340]   and time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.340]   What they're trying to make sure
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.420]   is not that they get that taste,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.440]   but that they get the caffeine.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.780]   It is that positively reinforcing.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.040]   And the taste therefore takes on new significance,
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.860]   new meaning, and we come to associate it as positive.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.140]   And in fact, most of us, including myself,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.500]   love the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.580]   love the taste of yerba mate,
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.720]   even if the initial taste,
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.700]   the very first time that we consume that beverage
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.860]   was either neutral or negative.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.380]   And that is all because of the reinforcing properties
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.220]   of caffeine.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.040]   And then of course,
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.300]   there are the more direct actions of caffeine,
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.560]   that is the faster actions of caffeine.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.100]   And just to list those off again very briefly
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.200]   so that you have them in mind going forward,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.580]   caffeine also increases the release of dopamine
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.560]   and acetylcholine,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.040]   both of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain,
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.640]   which increases clarity of thought
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.480]   and your ability to rule switch,
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.600]   your ability to move from one context to another
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.700]   and change and understand the rules of engagement,
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.440]   social engagement, physical engagement,
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.260]   mental engagement, and so forth.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.240]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.740]   caffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.200]   in the reward pathway,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.720]   such that any good thing that happens to you,
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.140]   any positive experience that you have
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.100]   will have a more potent effect
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.140]   on your feelings of wellbeing.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.700]   And last but certainly not least,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.860]   caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.340]   It reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.920]   and your desire to sleep
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.020]   by parking in the receptors for adenosine
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.780]   and not allowing adenosine to have its pro sleepy,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.960]   if you will, effects on your brain and body.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.340]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.400]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.860]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.220]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.120]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.800]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.020]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.620]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.700]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.680]   once or usually twice a day
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.600]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.280]   that I need for gut health.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.380]   Our gut is very important.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.920]   It's populated by gut microbiota.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.700]   They communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.100]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.740]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.600]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.420]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.980]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.900]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.780]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.220]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.680]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.080]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.060]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.380]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.660]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.940]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.360]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.040]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.420]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.340]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.620]   I'd like to just briefly talk about adenosine
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.260]   and some of its molecular features.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.060]   And again, if you don't have a background in biology,
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.060]   don't worry, I promise to make this very clear to everyone.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.900]   First of all, caffeine is what's called a methylxanthine.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.480]   It's a plant alkaloid.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.860]   That's why caffeine itself is very bitter.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.700]   Again, if I were to give you just the tiniest little bit
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.300]   of pure caffeine,
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.940]   you would find it to be extremely aversive.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.540]   And so these plants that have snuck
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.020]   small enough amounts of caffeine into them,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.380]   or that have masked the flavor of caffeine
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.540]   with other flavors such that bees and humans
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.020]   want to consume them.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.920]   While we don't know what plants think,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.660]   it does seem very diabolical and very clever
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.660]   in that we are seeking out these caffeine-containing plants,
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.460]   beverages and foods,
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.660]   even though caffeine itself is this alkaloid
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.000]   is very, very bitter.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.920]   Methylxanthine, that is caffeine,
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.420]   binds to adenosine receptors.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.500]   And there are really two types of adenosine receptors.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   There are the so-called A1 receptors and the A2 receptors,
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.380]   and they're present in different parts of the brain and body
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.100]   at different levels.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.660]   We don't have to get too far into receptor subtypes.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.960]   More importantly to understand is that adenosine
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.180]   makes us feel tired because of the way
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.900]   that it taps into the ATP pathway.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.100]   The ATP pathway is central to energy production
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.720]   and feelings of overall energy in our brain and body
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.500]   in all cells and organ systems.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   When caffeine binds to adenosine receptors,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.240]   it prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.620]   of the energy production pathway.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.180]   And the net consequence of that is increased cyclic AMP.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.100]   So basically when we ingest caffeine,
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.260]   we are biasing our system towards the pro-energetic aspects
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.660]   of these cellular pathways.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.340]   Now it's really important to understand that in biology,
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.140]   even if you block a receptor or you prevent the activity
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.540]   of an enzyme, and at least in this case,
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.460]   you end up with more cyclic AMP, more energy,
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.340]   you're not really getting more energy.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.200]   You're actually borrowing energy against an overall system
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.340]   that is frankly non-negotiable.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.220]   What do I mean by that?
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.660]   Well, let's say that you were to wake up after six
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.660]   or eight hours of sleep and to drink a lot of caffeine
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.140]   and keep drinking caffeine throughout the day,
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.760]   throughout the day, blocking those adenosine receptors.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.860]   Yes, you'll offset fatigue, you'll offset sleepiness
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.500]   because that adenosine simply can't function.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.000]   But at the point where the caffeine becomes dislodged
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   from the adenosine receptors, you will have a massive glut,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.420]   a backlog of adenosine, and you will feel extra,
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.700]   extra sleepy.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.120]   So really there's no way to create more energy
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.960]   in your system.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.640]   Really what you're doing is you're changing the timing
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.060]   in which the sleepy signals and the more energetic signals
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.300]   are arriving.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.400]   And this is really important to understand as the backdrop
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.580]   to the various tools that we're going to get into next
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.020]   in which you can use caffeine for enhancing mental
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.460]   performance and physical performance
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.380]   and other aspects of health.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.340]   But it's very important to understand this concept
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.780]   that when you wake up in the morning provided
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.840]   that you slept well and enough the night before,
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.800]   your levels of adenosine will be about as low
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.640]   as they will ever be.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.400]   Actually, in order to get your adenosine levels
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.640]   really bottomed out, you want to avoid caffeine
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.700]   in the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.560]   We'll talk about why that is because it turns out
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.540]   there's a way to completely clear adenosine
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.900]   out of your system in the hour or so after waking.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.000]   But for most people, adenosine levels are going to be close
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.120]   to their lowest after a good night's sleep.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.940]   But there's really no negotiating the accumulation
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.960]   of adenosine that's going to occur and going to bias you
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.480]   towards feeling more sleepy than you would otherwise
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.820]   that's going to occur throughout the day.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.740]   There's really no way to eliminate adenosine.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.500]   All you can really do is block its function.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.560]   So it's sort of like borrowing energy against the fatigue
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.060]   that you will inevitably feel.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.000]   Now, this actually has a very important
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.920]   socio-economical relevance.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:06.240]   Before caffeine was regularly consumed by human beings,
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.000]   we were really slaves to the light-dark cycle.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.400]   And this was especially true before the presence
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.720]   of artificial lighting.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.560]   But even before the advent of artificial lighting,
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.840]   humans were largely constrained
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.360]   to the outside light-dark cycle.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.640]   We need to be active during the day
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.760]   and working during the day,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.720]   and we need to be asleep at night.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.840]   Caffeine allows us to divorce ourselves
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.200]   from that circadian cycle.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.720]   Circadian just means about 24 hour.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.520]   Caffeine allows us to do that at least somewhat
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.960]   by way of increasing our alertness,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.740]   that is spiking our alertness at various times
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.360]   throughout the day and even at night.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.300]   This is how we can have shift workers, for instance,
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.760]   that can sleep during the day
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.200]   and then drink a strong cup of coffee at 8 p.m.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.640]   and then work into the night.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.400]   That ability completely transformed our society.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.560]   Now, of course, the healthiest schedule,
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.680]   we know this with certainty,
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.160]   the healthiest schedule for brain and body
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.080]   is going to be alert during the daytime and asleep at night.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.120]   There's no question about that.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.640]   Shift workers run into all sorts of health problems.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.680]   And thank you, shift workers,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.960]   for doing the important work that you do.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.440]   We need you, air traffic controllers, paramedics,
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.520]   firefighters, police officers, et cetera.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.340]   But we know that there are serious health consequences,
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.120]   negative health consequences, that is, for shift workers.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.020]   But for most people out there,
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.880]   about 95% of people follow a typical schedule
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.960]   where they're awake during the day and asleep at night.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.800]   And yet it used to be,
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.320]   before the advent of caffeine-containing beverages,
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.200]   that if you were sleepy in the afternoon,
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.660]   you either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness,
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.600]   that your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.360]   were governed by these circadian changes
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.360]   in availability of sunlight and when you slept.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.460]   And you just didn't have the ability to ingest a beverage
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.660]   that would increase your levels of alertness
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.040]   because you block adenosine.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.460]   So this is important to understand that nowadays,
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.280]   we certainly live in a time in which we use,
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.020]   in fact, 90% or more of adults
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.400]   and half or more of adolescents and teenagers,
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.960]   use caffeine as a way to negotiate with,
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.440]   to borrow against this natural pattern of adenosine
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.000]   making us sleepy.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.880]   But again, you're just offsetting the effects of sleepiness
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.920]   that adenosine causes.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.520]   You can't eliminate the adenosine entirely.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.400]   The important point is that adenosine
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.700]   as a pro-sleepy molecule is a non-negotiable aspect
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.960]   of your biology.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.400]   In fact, it's so non-negotiable that every 24 hours,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   you are going to release adenosine
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.140]   and you're going to release adenosine in direct proportion
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.800]   to how long you've been awake.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.760]   So the longer you've been awake,
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.680]   the more adenosine circulating in your system.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.480]   There are really only a handful of ways
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.920]   to completely clear out adenosine.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.800]   The major one being to get sleep.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   The other is to take a short nap, which of course is sleep,
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.240]   but it's shallow sleep.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.640]   Or non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR,
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.860]   has been shown to reduce levels of adenosine.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.340]   And there are certain things
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.420]   such as viewing morning sunlight,
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.580]   which because of its effects on cortisol
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.740]   can quote unquote clear out adenosine.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.220]   We'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.020]   And there's also evidence that certain forms of exercise,
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.460]   provided that it's brief and intense,
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.400]   can also reduce adenosine, not just block its effects.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.740]   Now that we've talked about some of the incredible mechanisms
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.560]   by which caffeine changes our experience of life
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.940]   increases alertness and mood, et cetera,
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.060]   I want to talk about the use of caffeine as a tool.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.320]   Now caffeine is a very potent and useful tool
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.380]   for enhancing mental health, physical health,
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.540]   and performance.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.020]   But there are certain considerations
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.340]   one has to keep in mind, in particular dose.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.140]   Now, first off, not everybody will respond
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.540]   to the same dose of caffeine the same way,
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.940]   but we can reliably say that your body weight
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.420]   is a good measure by which you can estimate
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.420]   what a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.740]   So for most people, ingesting one to three milligrams
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.860]   of caffeine per kilogram of body weight
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.100]   is going to be the range in which caffeine
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.900]   can have positive effects
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.020]   without making us feel overly anxious
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.360]   and give us that feeling that we're jumping out of our skin
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.420]   and turn the otherwise positive experience of caffeine
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.780]   into an aversive one.
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.660]   For those of you that aren't familiar with thinking
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.500]   in terms of kilograms and normally thinking pounds,
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.140]   I'll just quickly give you some general estimations
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.700]   that for instance, 100 kilograms equals 220 pounds.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.940]   So for me, I weigh 100 kilograms.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.220]   That means that one to three milligrams,
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.420]   again, milligrams, thousandths of a gram,
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.720]   one to three milligrams of caffeine
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.220]   per kilogram of body weight would mean for me,
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:48.020]   I could safely ingest 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.280]   in a single dose, in a single drink,
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.900]   if that's the way I'm consuming it,
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.580]   or pill form if that's the way that I'm consuming it.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.740]   And it's very likely that that will be a tolerable dose.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.860]   However, if you are not somebody that's accustomed
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.220]   to drinking caffeine on a regular basis,
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.360]   I suggest you start on the lower end
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.340]   of that one to three milligrams per kilogram
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.060]   of body weight range.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.780]   So for instance, if you're somebody who weighs 50 kilograms,
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.660]   that's approximately 110 pounds,
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.480]   and you would be pretty comfortable ingesting
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.400]   somewhere between 50 and 150 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.860]   So what I recommend is that people
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.180]   who are considering using caffeine as a tool
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.780]   or who are already ingesting caffeine,
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.640]   start to think about the dosage of caffeine
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.700]   that you are ingesting or plan to ingest
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.580]   and the timing in which you ingest that caffeine
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.620]   relative to certain tasks throughout your day,
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.740]   your waking and your sleep.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.180]   And we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.860]   But the first step for you is to figure out
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.900]   how much you weigh in kilograms,
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.940]   and then to go to that number of one to three milligrams
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.160]   of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.020]   And that's a good range in which you might want
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.120]   to explore the use of caffeine in a single application,
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.780]   meaning in a single dose.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.340]   Now, I do realize that some people out there
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.060]   are drinking coffee all day long
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.380]   or having coffee in the morning
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.620]   and then again in the afternoon.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.300]   What I'm referring to here is the ingestion of caffeine
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.020]   in a single bout, right?
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.140]   One cup of coffee or two cups of coffee, for instance,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.440]   to achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.300]   if that's what's appropriate for your body weight.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.020]   But to avoid any confusion,
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.880]   when I talk about dosage of caffeine,
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.340]   what I'm really talking about is not the total amount
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.940]   of caffeine ingested per day.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.380]   I'm talking about the total amount of caffeine ingested
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.200]   in one sitting or setting, that is.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.360]   And if you're somebody who's drinking caffeine
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.080]   multiple times throughout the day,
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.060]   you could imagine, for instance,
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.380]   let's say the appropriate dose for you
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.140]   in order to get an enhancement in mental performance
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.700]   or physical performance is 200 milligrams.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.880]   And you are somebody who's doing some work in the morning
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.380]   and you want to have that lift in the morning
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.840]   to be able to focus better.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.920]   And you're doing some physical exercise in the afternoon
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.360]   or vice versa, that you would ingest 200 milligrams
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.900]   of caffeine at two separate times per day,
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.940]   separated by about four hours.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.100]   Now, you don't have to separate them.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.320]   You could put them two hours apart, for instance.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.380]   But we'll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.280]   Just keep in mind that if you're ingesting 200 milligrams
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.960]   of caffeine, and that's the appropriate dose for you
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.280]   based on your body weight, and then you are ingesting
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.760]   another 200 milligrams of caffeine an hour later,
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.580]   you are effectively ingesting approximately 400 milligrams
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.740]   of caffeine, which is going to start exceeding the dose
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.540]   in which you can normally tolerate
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.660]   without feeling anxious and jittery.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.620]   With all of that said, there is a range of tolerance
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.180]   for caffeine that's based on two things.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.740]   One is a preexisting disposition.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.080]   That is whether or not your genetics and nervous system
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.120]   and the backdrop of your life,
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.620]   how much stress you're experiencing,
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.460]   tends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.220]   before you ingest any caffeine.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.660]   And the other is how so-called caffeine adapted you are.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.140]   We often hear about tolerance.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.740]   Tolerance means something very specific.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.800]   It's the ability to ingest more and more of something
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.060]   with a plateau that is a no increase
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.980]   or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.420]   But here, we're not really talking
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.600]   about tolerance to caffeine.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.740]   What we're talking about is being caffeine adapted.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.540]   A simple way to understand whether or not
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.980]   you're caffeine adapted or not is that if you drink caffeine
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.060]   and it tends to increase your heart rate
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.780]   and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious,
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.000]   then chances are you are not caffeine adapted,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.180]   provided the amount of caffeine
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.580]   is within the healthy range for you, that is,
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.580]   the ranges we talked about a moment ago.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.380]   However, if you're somebody who drinks caffeine
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.940]   and you actually feel alert and relaxed,
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.340]   chances are you are caffeine adapted.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.420]   And so at various times during today's episode,
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.100]   I'll talk about people who are caffeine adapted
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.180]   and people who are not caffeine adapted.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.640]   We'll talk about the use of caffeine every other day.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.460]   I know a few habitual caffeine drinkers, including myself,
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.580]   just the simple mention of that probably sounds aversive,
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.580]   but there is actually great utility
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.680]   to using caffeine every other day as opposed to every day.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.280]   But just keep in mind that some people will drink caffeine
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.740]   and not get much of a lift from it at all.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.980]   Other people will drink caffeine
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.800]   and they will feel extremely anxious,
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.860]   even at dosages far lower than that one to three milligrams
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.560]   per kilogram of body weight range
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.400]   that I described a moment ago.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.260]   So you have to take into account individual differences.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.320]   That said, one to three milligrams of caffeine
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.960]   per kilogram of body weight for a given sitting,
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.580]   for your morning coffee or your morning Yerba Mate tea
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.420]   is a good range from which to start.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.720]   And I do encourage you to go online
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.980]   and look up the various beverages and foods
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.740]   that you might be eating that contain caffeine
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.500]   For instance, some people are surprised to discover
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.020]   that the coffee that they get
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.340]   from some of the more standard popular vendors out there,
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.260]   the small coffee or the median coffee, for instance,
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.340]   can contain as much as 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.060]   And that the large coffee that is often sold
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.100]   at those commercial vendors can contain as much as one gram,
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.820]   1000 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.260]   Now you may be adapted to that
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.340]   such that it doesn't make you feel anxious,
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.820]   but if you wonder why you feel irritable
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.020]   and you get a headache when you don't get that caffeine
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.120]   or that amount of caffeine at precisely the time
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.880]   that you're used to getting it each day,
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.820]   that's because you are consuming quite large quantities
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.740]   of caffeine on a regular basis.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.940]   So I do recommend whether or not you drink soda
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.660]   or coffee or tea that you figure out the source of that.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.940]   Okay, so figure out what vendor you purchase it from,
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.500]   what kind of coffee and go online
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.860]   and spend a little bit of time
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.140]   because the information is out there
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.960]   to discover what levels of caffeine
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.560]   you're actually ingesting.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.060]   Now, if you happen to be ingesting
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.040]   more than one to three milligrams per kilogram
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.380]   of body weight of caffeine, that's not necessarily bad.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.700]   However, you do want to be careful
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.740]   about ingesting very high levels of caffeine
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.940]   over long periods of time in your life
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.460]   because there can be issues that start to arise,
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:00.020]   in particular, a bias towards higher levels of anxiety
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.640]   and depletion of certain electrolytes
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.980]   because caffeine is a diuretic,
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.900]   can cause you to lose sodium and other things of that sort.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.700]   And also just from simply a dependent standpoint,
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.940]   it does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine,
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.500]   that is exceeding the dosages
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.420]   that normally you could get away with
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.720]   and get just as much mental enhancing
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.080]   and physical enhancing benefits,
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.080]   that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature,
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.900]   you can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks,
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.860]   and you can become actually quite irritable
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.100]   when you're not getting those higher levels of caffeine.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.760]   So I do encourage you to figure out
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.940]   not just what an appropriate caffeine dosage would be for you
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.000]   but also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.580]   The first tool I'd like to talk about
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.440]   is one that I've mentioned before
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.760]   on this podcast several times.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.780]   And it's something that if you haven't heard of
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.980]   will be very useful to you.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.240]   And if you have heard this tool before,
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.020]   I'm going to add some additional features
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.540]   to the description of this tool
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.700]   that should make this worthwhile for you as well.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.460]   And that is to delay your caffeine intake
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.980]   And I'll be very clear as to days
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.700]   in which you might want to ingest caffeine
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.660]   more closely to when you wake up.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.980]   Why would you want to delay your caffeine intake
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:22.000]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking?
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.700]   The answer to that is very simple.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.580]   Many people wake up in the morning,
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.700]   they drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30,
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.520]   sometimes within two minutes of waking,
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.660]   and they feel more alert naturally.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.780]   That makes sense because of the effects of caffeine
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.620]   in blocking the effects of adenosine
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.740]   that I talked about earlier
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.800]   and its effects on other neurotransmitter systems.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.060]   But then what they find is that in the early afternoon,
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.060]   in particular after lunch,
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.180]   they experience a dramatic dip
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.580]   in their overall levels of energy,
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.060]   the so-called afternoon crash.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.740]   And in most cases, the way they respond to that
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.380]   is to ingest more caffeine,
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.860]   which indeed can increase their levels
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.820]   of mood and alertness.
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.040]   However, as we'll soon talk about,
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.220]   there is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   if it falls within eight or 10 or dare I even say 12 hours
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.340]   of going to sleep.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.900]   And that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.820]   for most everybody,
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:24.100]   let's say for 95 plus percent of people disrupts
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.080]   the architecture and quality of their nighttime sleep.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.420]   And I should say that it doesn't necessarily impact
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.740]   their ability to fall asleep
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.660]   and maybe even sleep through the night,
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.300]   but that the depth and quality of that sleep is disrupted
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.260]   by consuming caffeine in the afternoon.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.340]   A little bit later, I'll talk about how you can offset
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.760]   some of those negative effects
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.840]   if you absolutely require caffeine in the afternoon.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.300]   But there's a huge advantage
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.760]   to restricting your caffeine intake
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.260]   to the early part of your day,
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.160]   but not consuming caffeine
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.240]   within the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.820]   In fact, many people find that if they delay
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:02.060]   their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up,
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.700]   that they feel more alert in the morning
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.760]   and they completely avoid that afternoon crash.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.820]   Now that said, many people including myself
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.980]   do need a short nap or non-sleep deep rest
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.500]   or other form of relaxation
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.260]   for 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.220]   That is natural and healthy.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.220]   I'm not referring to the need for that
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.700]   when I refer to the so-called afternoon crash.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.980]   What I'm talking about in the afternoon crash
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.780]   is a inability to recover energy and focus
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.660]   and a need to consume more caffeine
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.260]   just to make it through the afternoon.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.880]   By delaying caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.980]   after waking, there are a couple of things
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:40.820]   that are accomplished.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.460]   First of all, you offset that afternoon crash,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.260]   and this is an effect that many people experience
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.900]   the very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.540]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.780]   And the reason this works so well is the following.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.260]   As I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.340]   that builds up the longer that we are awake.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.980]   It is a molecule that is reduced
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.980]   or cleared from our system by sleep.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.660]   So when we emerge from sleep,
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.040]   regardless of how long we've slept,
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.940]   our adenosine levels are lower than they were
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.860]   when we went to sleep the previous night.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:17.720]   If you slept well enough and long enough,
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.800]   those adenosine levels can be very, very low,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.580]   but they are never completely zero.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:24.560]   When you wake up in the morning,
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.980]   even if you're one of these people that springs out of bed
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.660]   and is ready to attack the day,
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.140]   and here I'm certainly not describing myself,
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:35.000]   I'm not one of those people, I tend to wake fairly slowly.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.820]   But if you're one of those spring up and attack the day,
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.300]   or you're one of the people who moves more slowly
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.960]   into your day, regardless,
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.380]   there's still some residual adenosine in your system.
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.000]   And this is particularly the case
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.500]   if you did not get enough sleep
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.880]   or enough depth of sleep the night before,
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.800]   the correct ratios of slow wave sleep
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.960]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.940]   And for those of you interested in optimizing sleep,
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.860]   I'll just refer you to our Master Your Sleep episode
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.180]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.100]   the Perfect Your Sleep episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.320]   And we have a toolkit for sleep, all of which are available,
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   zero cost, timestamped, et cetera, at HubermanLab.com.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.480]   You wake up in the morning
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.400]   and your adenosine levels are low,
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.960]   but they're not zero.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.440]   And if you didn't sleep that well
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.820]   or deeply enough the night before,
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.320]   you're going to have more adenosine in your system.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.920]   You might think the logical thing to do
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.180]   is therefore to drink caffeine
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.460]   and to block the adenosine that's there.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.360]   But what happens if you do that is there's an accumulation,
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.780]   a sort of glut of adenosine that hangs around.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:36.960]   And then in the afternoon,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.480]   when the effects of that caffeine start to wear off,
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.700]   you will experience the so-called afternoon crash.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:43.940]   As I mentioned earlier,
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.760]   there is a way to clear out the adenosine that's present
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.660]   when you wake up in the morning
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.940]   and to clear it out essentially completely
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.280]   without just blocking its receptors
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.940]   and letting it accumulate or hang around.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.300]   And the way to do that
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.020]   is to deliberately spike your cortisol.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.900]   Now, many of you have heard of cortisol,
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.500]   the so-called stress hormone, as a bad thing.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.380]   And indeed chronically elevated cortisol is a bad thing.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.140]   It depletes your immune system.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.660]   It's bad for psychosocial effects.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.640]   It tends to make us feel anxious and on and on.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.420]   But cortisol itself is not bad.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.640]   Cortisol is wonderful.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.620]   Cortisol enhances the efficiency of the immune system.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.300]   It makes us alert and focus.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.580]   It stimulates our metabolism.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.440]   It does a huge number of positive things
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.620]   provided that it is released in a circadian fashion,
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.340]   that is at the appropriate times every 24 hours,
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.740]   and that it tends to peak very close to waking.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.020]   In fact, one of the reasons you wake up in the morning,
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.260]   assuming that you weren't woken up by some noise
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:46.740]   or sleeping in an environment that's too warm, et cetera,
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:49.100]   is that your cortisol levels start to rise.
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.400]   And shortly after waking,
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.900]   your cortisol levels will start to reach their peak.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.220]   And when I refer to a cortisol pulse,
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.520]   that's just, I mean, biology nerd speak
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.760]   for a rise and peak in cortisol.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.140]   You want that cortisol pulse to occur
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.120]   early in the day close to waking.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.620]   And you want that for a couple of reasons.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.720]   First of all, if you don't restrict that cortisol pulse
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.180]   to early in the day,
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.000]   it will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.860]   And actually a late shifted cortisol peak
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.380]   is one of the hallmark signatures of depression,
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.140]   low level depression and serious depression.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.620]   And it can start to disrupt sleep
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.360]   and certainly can disrupt mood metabolism
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.020]   and your immune system.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.860]   So you want that cortisol peak early in the day.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.460]   How do you ensure that that happens?
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.640]   Well, you wake up in the morning
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.820]   and whether or not you're a bounce out of bed type
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.220]   or you're a more groggy,
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.500]   you know, kind of wade slowly into the day type like I am,
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:44.020]   you wake up and you don't ingest caffeine.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.800]   Fine and in fact beneficial to hydrate
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.680]   with water and electrolytes.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.660]   Terrific, in fact, I would say necessary
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.980]   to get bright light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.460]   I've talked about this many, many times before
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.300]   on the podcast.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.900]   If you wake up before the sun comes out,
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.580]   then turn on bright artificial lights,
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.220]   but then certainly once the sun is out
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.240]   and even on cloudy days, in fact,
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.540]   especially on cloudy days,
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.600]   get outside for anywhere from five to 20,
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.760]   maybe even 30 minutes, do some work outside,
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.060]   take your breakfast outside if you're a breakfast eater,
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.140]   get something done outside,
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.520]   even if it's just to get outside
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.540]   and get bright light in your eyes, why?
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.300]   Well, because it's been shown in studies on humans
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.260]   that getting bright light in your eyes
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.140]   in the first hour after waking
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.040]   or as soon as possible after waking
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.040]   increases the peak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, 5-0.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.460]   And that cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood,
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.620]   yes, increases alertness,
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.860]   but it does one other very important thing,
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.940]   which is that through an indirect pathway,
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.940]   it can clear out any residual adenosine
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.300]   that might be present in your system
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.140]   when you wake up in the morning.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.720]   Again, this is going to be especially important
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.760]   for those of you that are not getting as much sleep
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.940]   or as much quality sleep as you would like.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.500]   It's going to be very important for you
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.220]   to get that morning bright light, ideally from sunlight,
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.780]   get that cortisol peak going.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.520]   Other ways to increase that cortisol peak
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.600]   would be to do some physical activity.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.580]   If you don't have time to do a full workout,
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.640]   well, then getting some movement,
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.720]   10 minutes of skipping rope
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.980]   or even five minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.720]   or walking if that's all you have time for,
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.880]   ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.440]   but that's going to zero out
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.600]   the adenosine present in your system.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.340]   If however, you were to wake up
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.580]   and immediately drink caffeine,
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.660]   caffeine itself can stimulate the release of cortisol
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.500]   a little bit more than it would otherwise
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.120]   be present in your system,
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.060]   but by blocking those adenosine receptors
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.760]   and because of the indirect effects of caffeine
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.300]   on the cortisol system,
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.420]   you actually are reducing the clearance of adenosine
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.300]   that would otherwise occur.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.700]   So I realize that's a mouthful, just to be very clear,
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.400]   if you wake up and you ingest caffeine right away,
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.960]   you're blocking the adenosine receptor,
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.120]   but you're not clearing it out.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.480]   You're also preventing cortisol
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.440]   from having its normal increase in rise
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.600]   such that it can directly clear out adenosine
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.340]   because cortisol can clear out adenosine.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.380]   And that's what you want.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.080]   You want to be at maximum alertness and focus
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.020]   in your morning and throughout your day.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.240]   And by delaying your caffeine
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.820]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.380]   you set up your system
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.180]   so that you get that morning cortisol peak,
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.920]   ideally a peak that's even greater
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.000]   because you're getting your bright light viewing.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.360]   And then when you ingest your caffeine
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.740]   90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.220]   not only will you be craving it just a little bit,
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.220]   but you will be drinking that caffeine
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.860]   on an already existing backdrop of increased alertness
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.700]   for two reasons.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.720]   One is adenosine is zeroed out
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.020]   and your cortisol peak is higher.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.660]   And so now when you ingest caffeine,
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.620]   you can actually ingest levels of caffeine
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.060]   that are a little more reasonable,
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.400]   that almost with certainty are going to fall
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.900]   in this one to three milligrams per kilogram dosage
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.520]   and will allow you to feel really alert
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.340]   and will carry that alertness well into the afternoon hours
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.720]   without the need to drink more caffeine
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.020]   and thereby will prevent you from drinking caffeine
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.020]   and disrupting your nighttime sleep.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.280]   And of course, by getting better nighttime sleep,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.560]   you're going to zero out your adenosine even more.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.260]   So what I'm describing here are essentially two tools.
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.700]   I'm telling you to get morning sunlight
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.620]   and maybe some exercise in conjunction with that,
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.700]   even if it's brief exercise.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:32.640]   But the main tool of delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.520]   after waking has immediate effects,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.800]   but it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.940]   that lead to better sleep and more wakefulness
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.700]   the next night and the next day and so on and so forth.
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   Now I realize there are some people who just simply cannot
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.580]   or will not delay their caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.700]   after waking for whatever reason.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.040]   First off, let me say that if you are somebody
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.760]   who likes to wake up and do very intense exercise
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.300]   within the first 90 minutes after waking,
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.780]   well, in that case, it would be appropriate
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.640]   to ingest your caffeine just prior to doing that exercise.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.580]   Not a problem, not a problem,
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.660]   but you should expect that the combination
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.160]   of drinking caffeine very shortly after waking
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.300]   plus exercising very intensely shortly after waking
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:21.580]   will increase the intensity of that early afternoon
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.300]   and afternoon fatigue that you feel.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.680]   Now, for some people, that's a great thing.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.900]   They can afford to take a nap or do non-sleep deep rest,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.560]   step away from work and so forth.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.340]   In that case, I strongly encourage you to do whatever it is
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.100]   that allows you to get regular exercise
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:38.300]   because regular exercise is going to be very beneficial.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.220]   In fact, we did an entire episode called Toolkit for Fitness
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.100]   that describes a couple of different,
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.420]   but really one main structure that allows you
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.900]   to get the appropriate amount of resistance training
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.700]   and cardiovascular training
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.500]   and flexibility training throughout the week.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.460]   I happen to follow that program
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.120]   and it works very well.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.200]   And it does involve some of those workouts
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.380]   to come very early in the morning, shortly after waking.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.120]   And in those cases, I do ingest caffeine just prior to those.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.500]   So within 10, 20 minutes of waking.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.300]   However, on other days,
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.200]   I personally delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.240]   And I've done that to great benefit.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.180]   And most people, if not all people that try that
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.740]   have reported the same.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.340]   I should mention that some people will find getting out
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:23.120]   to that 90 minutes to be excruciatingly difficult
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.100]   because they're so accustomed to ingesting caffeine
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:26.980]   close to waking up.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.260]   In that case, maybe just push out your caffeine intake
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.580]   by about 15 minutes each day
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.380]   until you hit that 90 to 120 minute mark.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.420]   And that will make it much easier.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.820]   It might take you a week or so to get there.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:37.860]   But once you get there,
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.260]   you'll find it to be quite easy to maintain.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.900]   The other thing is that if you are somebody
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.180]   who insists on drinking caffeine very shortly after waking,
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.420]   I would encourage you to drink half of your caffeine then,
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.980]   and then the other half of your caffeine
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.020]   about an hour later.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:55.140]   That also will help offset some of the afternoon crash
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.500]   for reasons related to the so-called kinetics of caffeine.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.120]   Caffeine has a quarter life of about 12 hours.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.900]   That means that if you were to ingest a cup of coffee
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.960]   at let's say 8 a.m. and let's say 100 milligram coffee,
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.000]   just for sake of simplicity,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.840]   that about 25% of that caffeine action,
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.300]   we wouldn't really say 25 milligrams,
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.240]   but about 25% of that caffeine action
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:23.240]   will still be present at 8 p.m. that night,
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.600]   which is pretty remarkable.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.560]   So there's a long arc of caffeine effects,
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.900]   and this is why it can impede sleep
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.700]   if we take caffeine in the afternoon.
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.620]   But again, if you're somebody who wakes up
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.180]   and you really need caffeine right away
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:37.160]   and you refuse to do this 90 to 120 minute delay thing
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.340]   that I'm talking about,
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.340]   well, then in that case,
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.300]   I would drink half of your caffeine upon waking
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.980]   and then a little bit more or the other half
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.260]   about an hour later,
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.100]   and that will extend the arc of that caffeine effects
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.140]   such that you don't need it again in the afternoon
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.380]   because you won't experience the afternoon crash.
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.840]   Because of the way caffeine works,
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.140]   I should mention that if you ingest caffeine
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.360]   on an empty stomach,
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.900]   it will have a more potent stimulant effect.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.940]   That will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.500]   that caffeine can produce.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.660]   Later, I'll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness,
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.480]   but I'll just tell you one tool now.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.100]   Many people opt to take 100 milligrams of theanine,
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.300]   T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.600]   as a way to offset some of that jitteriness.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.640]   Theanine will reduce the jitteriness of caffeine,
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.180]   which is why many energy drink manufacturers
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.100]   and even some coffee manufacturers
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.320]   are now putting theanine in energy drinks
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.980]   and in ground coffee.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:33.020]   Because no surprise,
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.900]   it allows people to consume more of that beverage
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.020]   and thereby purchase more of that beverage,
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.780]   which is what these vendors want,
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:42.300]   without feeling overly anxious and jittery.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.260]   So you can take pill form theanine if you want
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.100]   with your caffeine.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:45.980]   I don't tend to do that.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.740]   Rather, I control the total dosage of my caffeine.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.860]   I do tend to consume caffeine on an empty stomach
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.460]   because I do restrict my caffeine intake
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.500]   to the early part of the day.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.460]   And I generally eat my first meal somewhere around 11 a.m.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.440]   And then I generally eat my last meal sometime
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.740]   around 8 p.m. or so.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.900]   Those are averages, I would say, plus or minus an hour.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.460]   And that's not because I'm religiously following
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.120]   any kind of time-restricted feeding.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.300]   It's just that tends to work best with my schedule
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.960]   and my appetite.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.440]   But again, that's a general theme.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.200]   There are days in which I wake up and I'm very hungry
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.020]   and I might ingest something, a small snack or something.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.540]   Or if I'm meeting somebody for breakfast,
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.960]   sometimes I'll have breakfast, sometimes I won't.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.140]   And so on and so forth.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.540]   The point is that you can get away with drinking
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.820]   less caffeine to get the stimulant effect
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.500]   if you do it on an empty stomach.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.380]   And if you're somebody who likes to exercise
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.580]   on an empty stomach, and I'm one of those people,
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.740]   well then ingesting caffeine just prior to exercise
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.360]   can be a fantastic tool.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.340]   A little bit later, we'll talk about some of the
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.800]   physical performance enhancing effects of caffeine,
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.220]   but I'll just briefly jump to a point about that
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.420]   as we relate to morning exercise.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.220]   If you are somebody who regularly ingest caffeine,
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:03.260]   and we can define regularly by if you've ingested caffeine
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.020]   every day for the last two weeks,
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.140]   you're a regular consumer of caffeine.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   Whereas if you're somebody who only ingest caffeine
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.560]   somewhere between two and four times per week,
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.340]   well then you are not a regular consumer of caffeine.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.540]   You're an intermittent user of caffeine.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.960]   Well, if you're somebody who's a regular user of caffeine,
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.340]   the performance enhancing effects of caffeine
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.100]   are going to be most dramatic
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.820]   if you take two or three days off from drinking caffeine,
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.020]   which to my mind is a,
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.420]   I don't want to call myself a caffeine addict,
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.900]   but a regular caffeine user,
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:36.280]   that's a horrible notion to me, an aversive notion,
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.660]   because I do like the effects of caffeine so much.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.980]   But if you really want to see the maximum performance
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.640]   enhancing effects of caffeine,
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.340]   you will do either one of two things.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.020]   You will either abstain from caffeine for a few days
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.740]   or three days prior to ingesting caffeine,
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:54.180]   or you will use caffeine on an empty stomach.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.740]   It's very clear that caffeine on an empty stomach
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.560]   enhances both the mental
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.580]   and physical enhancing effects of caffeine.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.300]   And of course, all of that has to be stated
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.980]   on the backdrop of consideration that if you,
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.200]   you know, you're very, very hungry,
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.740]   it can be make it hard to concentrate
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.560]   and so on and so forth.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.840]   So I'm not encouraging people to starve themselves
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.340]   by any means, certainly don't do that.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.740]   But if you want to maximize
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.660]   the performance enhancing effects of caffeine,
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.120]   you will consume it on an empty stomach.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.300]   And then as a final point to that,
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.120]   caffeine is a diuretic.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.980]   It causes us to lose fluid
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.460]   and along with that fluid to excrete sodium
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.180]   because of the effects of caffeine
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.740]   on various processes within the kidney.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.780]   So one thing that works very well
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.100]   to maintain mood and alertness,
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.600]   longer given a certain amount of caffeine intake
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.100]   and to avoid the jitteriness
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.140]   and what can sometimes feel like a crash
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.580]   or low blood sugar feeling or even blurry vision
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.680]   is to make sure that you consume
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.740]   at least an equal volume of water with your caffeine.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.180]   And ideally that water would contain
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.340]   maybe a small pinch of salt
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.580]   or some sort of electrolyte drink or powder rather.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.780]   For me, I use Element.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:02.020]   Full disclosure, they are a podcast affiliate and sponsor,
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.280]   but you don't need to do that.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.740]   You could simply just have a glass of water
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.780]   alongside your coffee or espresso
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.180]   or your yerba mate and just put a small pinch of sea salt
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.180]   in that or even just plain table salt.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.400]   And that will help offset
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.020]   some of the jitteriness of caffeine.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.700]   A lot of people think that when they ingest caffeine,
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.020]   they get the jitteriness and crash
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.820]   because their blood sugar is low.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.040]   And while that can be the case,
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.800]   oftentimes it's simply because of the excretion of sodium
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.740]   that's occurred when they've ingested caffeine.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.380]   So I encourage you to hydrate well
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.140]   and to hydrate with something
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.820]   that contains a little bit of sodium.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.900]   Obviously not so much that it increases hypertension
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:36.740]   or something of that sort,
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.900]   but a small amount of sodium
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.400]   or an electrolyte drink like Element.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.780]   And there are other electrolyte drinks out there
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.360]   that can accomplish the same, of course.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.300]   Just a couple of quick notes about theanine
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.480]   because there are a growing number of products out there
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.500]   that contain theanine.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.620]   And there's certainly a growing number of people out there
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.860]   who are using theanine
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.300]   for the effect that I described before,
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.220]   which is to offset some of the jitteriness
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.540]   associated with caffeine containing beverages or foods.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.940]   And of course, I should mention that
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.780]   I've talked about the effects of theanine on sleep
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.580]   at that sleep toolkit that you can find as a free download.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.080]   You don't even have to sign up for anything.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.900]   You can just download it from hubermanlab.com,
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.180]   go to the menu, go to newsletter,
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.820]   you'll see the toolkit for sleep.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.420]   You'll see that the so-called sleep stack
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.860]   that I use and recommend includes magnesium threonate,
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:24.720]   something called apigenin and theanine.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.940]   Although that sleep stack is designed to be taken
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.860]   30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.320]   And I make the point there and I'll make it again here,
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.500]   that ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.380]   if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams,
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   night terrors or night sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.480]   In that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.380]   However, a number of people are using theanine
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:52.300]   and products are using theanine to offset jitteriness
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:55.100]   from caffeine containing products during the daytime,
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.180]   daytime consumption that is.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.540]   A couple of notes about theanine.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.700]   Theanine is something that is present in green tea, right?
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.740]   It's now been created as a supplement.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.920]   It's what's called a non-protein amino acid.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.740]   So while there are amino acids and proteins,
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.180]   there are of course amino acids and non-proteins
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.860]   and theanine is one such non-protein amino acid.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.420]   Theanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.280]   and glutamine pathway.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.500]   It's actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.780]   And it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.900]   of the nervous system.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.060]   But the general effect of theanine is to compete
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:33.060]   for the receptors for certain neurotransmitters.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.380]   And the neurotransmitters I'm referring to
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.400]   are all excitatory neurotransmitters, things like glutamate.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.400]   And they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.060]   and action and feeling, et cetera,
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.720]   because they're present at so many connections
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.180]   between neurons in the brain.
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:51.100]   Theanine competes for the receptors for glutamate
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.900]   and tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.020]   So really when people take theanine along with caffeine,
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.620]   what they're doing is they're really taking a slight,
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.060]   I don't want to call it depressant
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.580]   to the point where it misleads people
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.940]   and makes people think that it will make you depressed.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.300]   The word is a little bit misleading,
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:12.580]   but tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.660]   pro-alertness actions of neurons in the brain.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.160]   So when you take it alongside caffeine,
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.740]   tends to quote unquote even things out a bit.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.020]   I should mention that the dosages of theanine
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.980]   that are effective for offsetting
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.660]   the jitteriness of caffeine is 200 to 400 milligrams.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.200]   And the studies that I was able to find
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.140]   showed that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.420]   can be safe, but that's a very high dosage of theanine.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:39.860]   In fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.940]   to the point where it wouldn't feel good.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.980]   There are also some positive effects
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.380]   of daytime consumption of theanine
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.040]   that are independent of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.420]   For instance, there's a study demonstrating
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.020]   that 17 days of ingesting theanine
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.680]   at these 200 to 400 milligram dosage
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.780]   of one to three times per day
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:02.400]   can reduce depression and anxiety.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.820]   There are also some good data out there
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.300]   showing that theanine can have positive effects
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.200]   on endothelial cells, so blood vessels,
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.780]   capillaries, and so on,
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.260]   and increase some of the function of blood vessels,
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.700]   allowing them to pass more blood through them,
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.220]   give them a little bit more elasticity, if you will.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.020]   So theanine has certain pro-sleep effects
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:22.380]   if it's taken prior to sleep.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:25.900]   It can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.300]   Again, if you're a sleepwalker
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.100]   or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.380]   from which you wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.880]   probably best to leave out theanine
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.260]   or maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams,
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.940]   and if that's still too much, then eliminate it completely.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.100]   But theanine can be terrific
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.760]   for enhancing quality, depth, and duration of sleep.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.700]   It can also reduce the jitteriness associated
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.980]   with caffeine-containing beverages and foods,
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.780]   and it has certain antidepressant
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.180]   and pro-endothelial effects.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.540]   That is, it can offset depression, it can offset anxiety,
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.080]   although those are minor effects, subtle effects,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.160]   and it has been shown to improve endothelial cell,
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.420]   that is vessel and capillary function and structure,
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:13.700]   in ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.180]   Now, one final point about theanine
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.600]   that's worth paying attention to
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.040]   is that the kinetics of theanine are such
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.420]   that you don't need to take theanine
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.780]   every time you ingest a caffeinated beverage.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:28.840]   When we ingest caffeine, the peak effects of caffeine
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.860]   occur about 30 minutes after we drink it,
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.500]   and there, I'm assuming one takes it all at once,
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.940]   and this is a key point that we'll come back to later,
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.620]   rather than sipping your coffee slowly
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.180]   over a couple of hours or an hour.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.340]   If you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.420]   in your coffee, 600 milligrams of your coffee,
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.700]   if you're getting one of those commercial coffees,
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.260]   and you take theanine along with it,
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:56.800]   theanine will block some of the jitteriness
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.840]   and anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine that can occur
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.000]   for much longer than the effects that caffeine lasts.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.500]   So the peak in theanine occurs
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.240]   about an hour after ingestion.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.500]   I suppose if you wanted to get really fancy
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.400]   and really dial in the kinetics,
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.080]   you could ingest theanine about half hour
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.300]   before you ingest your caffeine,
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.180]   but I think that's getting a little bit excessive
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.680]   in terms of controlling your microenvironment, if you will.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.940]   I think it would be perfectly fine
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:27.940]   to take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.660]   along with your coffee or tea and so forth,
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:34.220]   and just realize that if you drink more caffeine
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.180]   or you extend your caffeine intake over several hours,
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.220]   that you don't necessarily have to take theanine
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.020]   repeated times throughout the day.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.660]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.740]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:48.220]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.740]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.380]   to help you better understand your body
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.220]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.880]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.300]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.300]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.900]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:05.980]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:09.500]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.040]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.780]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.580]   Inside Tracker solves that problem
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.900]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.920]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.760]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.340]   you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.500]   of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids,
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.140]   and other things that impact your immediate
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.460]   and long-term health to bring those numbers
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.260]   into the ranges that are appropriate
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.140]   and indeed optimal for you.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.540]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.620]   Let's talk for a moment about when to avoid caffeine.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:50.340]   And in the same stroke,
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.620]   let's also talk about some of the myths around caffeine.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:56.060]   For instance, one of the major myths around caffeine
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:59.280]   is that it can increase osteoporosis.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.300]   Turns out that while there is a relationship, of course,
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.740]   between calcium and osteoporosis,
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.640]   that is reductions in bone density,
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.580]   and it is the case that caffeine can extract calcium
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.000]   from certain tissues,
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.860]   the large-scale studies that are out there
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.420]   essentially prove that if people are ingesting
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.740]   enough calcium through their diet,
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.560]   which most everybody is,
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.080]   although certainly there are some people
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.540]   that need to supplement calcium
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.940]   or make it a point to consume more calcium-containing foods,
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.260]   but assuming that you are getting
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.660]   adequate levels of calcium,
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.380]   there is no direct relationship
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.500]   between caffeine intake and osteoporosis,
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.420]   at least not that I'm aware of.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.360]   I know this was debated for a number of years
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.400]   in the literature,
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.840]   but the literature seems to have arrived
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.740]   at a general consensus now
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.660]   that caffeine itself is not going to create
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.500]   or exacerbate osteoporosis,
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.600]   provided people are getting enough calcium
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.060]   through their diet, that is through foods,
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.740]   through supplementation, or both.
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.820]   Some of the other myths around caffeine are that,
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.980]   for instance, caffeine will reduce testosterone levels
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.720]   or will reduce estrogen levels.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.300]   Other myths out there are an exact opposite to that,
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.980]   that caffeine will increase testosterone levels,
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.340]   in particular, free testosterone levels.
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.140]   There've been some large-scale studies
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.600]   addressing the hormone effects of caffeine.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.560]   They are a little bit difficult to do.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.100]   I should just mention that caveat.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.080]   And the reason they are difficult to do
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.620]   is because 90% of adults are consuming caffeine,
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.260]   and therefore, you can imagine,
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:35.780]   it's very hard to find a control group
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:38.540]   to compare the caffeine consumers to.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:41.860]   In particular, a control group that's well-controlled
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.220]   for other things like lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:50.480]   However, when one controls as well as one can
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.240]   for all the various factors that could impact hormones,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.880]   what one discovers is that caffeine intake,
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.760]   at least at the dosages we talked about earlier,
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.140]   one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.220]   or even up to double that,
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:09.220]   that there are no consistent increases or reductions
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.360]   in testosterone or estrogen in men or women
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.320]   that can be directly attributed to the caffeine intake.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.580]   And I say directly attributed
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.500]   because in these association studies,
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.300]   one always has to wonder, for instance,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.260]   if because people are ingesting more caffeine,
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.560]   they have more energy and therefore exercising more,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.300]   and exercise is known to have effects
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.740]   on testosterone, estrogen, and other hormones,
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.220]   whether or not the effects of caffeine on those hormones
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.900]   is indirect and so on and so forth.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.820]   And this all just underscores the challenges
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.040]   of doing studies on humans in the wild,
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.820]   in their natural habitat of living,
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.700]   as opposed to an acute study, as it's called,
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.180]   that brings someone into the laboratory
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.340]   and studying them just for those hours or moments.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:50.420]   With all that said, there does appear to be a relationship
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:53.580]   between caffeine intake and so-called sex hormone
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:58.460]   and binding globulin, which is a protein present
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:01.700]   in the body of both men and women
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.760]   that binds to the sex steroid hormones,
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.980]   testosterone and estrogen,
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.860]   and prevents them from being in their free or active form.
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:13.580]   It has been shown that ingestion of caffeine,
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.220]   even in the sorts of dosage ranges that are considered safe
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.480]   and that we've been discussing,
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.620]   can increase sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.860]   such that it can slightly reduce overall levels
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:28.220]   of free testosterone and free estradiol in women.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:32.160]   Now, those effects are relatively minor, but they do exist.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.860]   If any of you are interested in reading further
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.340]   into the effects of caffeine on hormones,
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.420]   I'll just refer you to a couple of studies.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.420]   We will link to this in the show note caption.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.820]   The title of the study is
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.300]   "Consumption of Caffeinated Beverages
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.860]   "and Serum Concentrations of Sex Steroid Hormones
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.100]   "in U.S. Men."
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.420]   And within this study, there's a reference
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:54.260]   to a equally-sized empowered study done on women,
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:56.780]   both of which converged on the same conclusion,
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:59.300]   by examining more than 1,000,
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:03.360]   so in this case, 1,410 men, or more than 1,000 women,
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.340]   that there are increases in sex hormone binding globulin
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:10.420]   associated with increased intake of coffee in particular,
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.420]   but they were able to narrow that down specifically
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.740]   to ingestion of caffeine.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.380]   So it's not coffee per se that's causing the increase
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.120]   in sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.220]   it's actually caffeine itself.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:25.380]   Now, again, the increases in sex hormone binding globulin
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.700]   were not so significant that, at least to my mind,
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.100]   they seem like a concern,
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.540]   although I think that it is worth noting
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.140]   that if you're going to consume caffeine,
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.620]   that you'd probably want to consume caffeine
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:40.260]   in a way that is in dosages and with the sort of timing
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.920]   that will allow you to get away with ingesting caffeine,
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.900]   but not to excess, so to derive the benefits of caffeine
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:47.780]   without, for instance,
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.540]   driving up sex hormone binding globulin too far.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.780]   Now, why would that be a good idea?
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.860]   Why would you want to make sure
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.760]   that you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen?
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.600]   Well, some of that is related to the acute effects
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.700]   of those hormones in terms of wellbeing and libido
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.560]   and strength and mood, et cetera,
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.740]   but some of it is also related
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.620]   to the longer term effects of sex steroid hormones.
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.380]   Many people don't realize this,
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.420]   but the sex steroid hormones operate on the receptors
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.020]   at the surface of cells to have immediate effects,
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.100]   but they also can enter cells
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:20.960]   and actually go into the nucleus of cells
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   where the DNA of those cells are contained
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.460]   and control gene expression in those cells.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.880]   So the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.500]   are controlling a lot of different cellular functions
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.900]   over long periods of time.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.140]   So blunting their action over long periods of time
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:36.900]   is probably not a great idea.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.500]   But again, at the dosages of caffeine
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.640]   that we're talking about today,
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.940]   one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.360]   unlikely that the increases in sex hormone binding globulin
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.980]   that one experiences from that are going to be detrimental.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.800]   And certainly the positive effects of caffeine
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.380]   that one experiences in terms of mental performance
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.360]   and physical performance,
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.160]   and the fact that it increases energy
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.620]   to do the sorts of things like exercise
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.940]   that we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:07.120]   Twofold or threefold improvement in hormone profiles.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.120]   In that case, it seems that ingesting caffeine
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.300]   is overall a good thing provided it's not in excess.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.020]   That also makes this the appropriate time to mention
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.420]   one of the more impressive effects of caffeine,
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:21.640]   which is on overall levels of mood and mental health.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   There are several studies on this,
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.200]   but the one that I'm particularly fond of
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.740]   was published in 2019 in Psychiatry Research.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.100]   And the title of the paper is
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.360]   Inverse Association Between Caffeine Intake
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.560]   and Depressive Symptoms in US Adults.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.560]   And these are data from the National Health
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.560]   and Nutrition Examination Survey.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.180]   And the basic takeaway is that while of course,
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.200]   there are a ton of different factors
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.180]   that are going to relate to whether or not
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.520]   people are depressed or not, life circumstances,
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.080]   genetics, and so on, that,
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.280]   and here I'm quoting from the study,
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.080]   caffeine's psychostimulant properties,
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.440]   that just means the ability to make us feel more alert
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.080]   and positive, appear to protect against depressive symptoms.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.160]   And of course, they acknowledge
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.880]   that additional studies are needed.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   But this is just one of several studies
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.960]   pointing to the fact that people who regularly ingest
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.260]   caffeine in the appropriate dosages
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.960]   do seem to enjoy an anti-depressive effect overall.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.420]   I wouldn't want anyone to consider caffeine
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.280]   a treatment for severe depression,
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.060]   or at least not alone a treatment for severe depression,
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.800]   but provided the anxiety inducing effects of caffeine
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.960]   can be kept in check through use of theanine
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.860]   or making sure that the dosage
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.720]   and the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct,
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.940]   then caffeine overall seems to be good for our mood
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.080]   and prevent depression or at least keep depression at bay
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.120]   when depression might otherwise surface or be more severe.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.780]   And of course, there are the don'ts
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:44.340]   surrounding caffeine intake.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:48.860]   As it relates to sleep, and to put it very simply,
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.280]   sleep that is getting enough quality sleep each night
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.680]   is the foundation.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.320]   It is the bedrock of mental health,
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.720]   physical health and performance.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.840]   Sleep and the power of sleep far exceeds
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.200]   any nootropic you could ever take,
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.400]   any prescription drug you could ever take,
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.800]   any health promoting tool for your immune system,
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.320]   your metabolism, your mental function,
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.880]   your physical function you could ever take.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.800]   Sleep is the bedrock.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.360]   I know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.840]   Nobody is perfect about sleep.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.580]   That's important to keep in mind.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:24.220]   I think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.900]   of sufficient duration, 80% of the nights of your life,
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.860]   and then as much as possible to make sure
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.840]   that the remaining 20% of nights,
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.000]   you're not getting enough sleep for good reasons
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:33.840]   as opposed to hard reasons.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:36.060]   Good reasons would include raising children.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:36.920]   That's important.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.020]   After all, every species desires to make more of itself
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:45.040]   and to preserve and extend the wellbeing of its young.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.920]   So child rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.780]   to get a lack of sleep,
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.020]   but you really want to strive to get quality sleep
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.280]   most nights of your life.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.520]   Which means that even if you're somebody
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:01.060]   who can "drink an espresso" and then fall right asleep,
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:03.940]   that you avoid caffeine intake
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:06.880]   in the 12 hours prior to sleep.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.020]   I realize not everyone will be able to do that.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.860]   In fact, I sometimes violate that.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.620]   So I tend to go to sleep around 10 p.m. every night,
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:18.280]   sometimes 11, occasionally 12 midnight,
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.200]   but usually around 10 p.m. every night.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.940]   I confess that my last ingestion of caffeine
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:29.560]   is not always 10 a.m. or prior to that.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.580]   So sometimes I will have caffeine up until 11 a.m.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.320]   or maybe noon.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.420]   And very, very rarely I'll have an afternoon coffee
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.420]   or espresso or non calorie containing soda
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.520]   or tea or something of that sort.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:48.080]   But I really try to restrict my caffeine intake
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.260]   to the early part of my day that is before noon,
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.440]   given that I go to sleep around 10 p.m. each night.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.220]   And I strongly encourage everyone out there
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.920]   to try and limit their afternoon caffeine intake.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:03.300]   This is something that Dr. Matt Walker,
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.780]   who's an expert sleep researcher
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:07.700]   out of University of California, Berkeley,
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.540]   psychology and neuroscience department there,
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.380]   author of the incredible book, "Why We Sleep."
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:14.600]   He's been on this podcast, many other podcasts,
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.500]   talking about the importance of sleep.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.100]   He will remind us, and I'll remind you now
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:23.140]   that the quarter life of caffeine is 12 hours.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.140]   I mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to repeat it again.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:29.420]   And that means that if you ingest caffeine at noon,
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:32.180]   25% of its effects, more or less,
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:33.420]   okay, I'm using broad stroke here
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.860]   to talk about quarter life.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.380]   25% of that is still going to be bioactive
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:39.860]   at midnight that night,
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:42.580]   which will disrupt the early phase of your night,
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.100]   the amount of slow wave sleep,
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.460]   which then in turn will disrupt
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.980]   the amount of rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.660]   which will disrupt your emotional processing
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:53.140]   during the following day and so on and so forth.
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.440]   None of this is to say
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.180]   that if you have the occasional cup of coffee
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:58.300]   in the afternoon, that's going to completely demolish
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.040]   your sleep-wake cycle forever.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:03.260]   But I really encourage people to avoid drinking caffeine
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.520]   in the 12 hours prior to sleep.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.860]   And if you can't do that within the 10 hours prior to sleep,
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.600]   and if you can't do that within the eight hours
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.820]   prior to sleep, so really try and limit your caffeine intake
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:16.220]   in the eight to 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:18.540]   And of course, slow wave sleep, aka deep sleep,
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:23.180]   is the sleep that's associated with somewhat mundane dreams,
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.180]   which makes it sound like it might not be that important,
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:28.180]   but it's also the sleep that's associated
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.600]   with growth hormone release,
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.560]   which is important for protein synthesis,
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.520]   repair of all bodily tissues and metabolism,
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.000]   and slow wave sleep is also critically attached
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.780]   to your immune system's ability
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.600]   to clear out bacteria and viruses
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.620]   that might otherwise infect your tissues.
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:47.440]   Now I'd like to talk about caffeine and performance,
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.260]   and that includes both mental performance
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.960]   and physical performance.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.520]   Now I'd like to talk about caffeine
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.940]   and its positive effects on performance
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.700]   when used correctly.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.460]   And here we are referring to both mental performance
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.760]   and physical performance.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:06.720]   The exploration of caffeine as a pro-performance tool
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.640]   has been explored since the 1930s,
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.920]   at least that's some of the earliest
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.280]   documented literature on this.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.440]   Although I have to imagine,
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.200]   given that people have been using caffeine
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.860]   for much longer than that,
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.540]   that long ago, somebody realized that
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.380]   by ingesting a certain plant,
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.980]   that they felt much more alertness
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:25.700]   and were able to hunt and gather
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.540]   or do any number of different things better,
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.780]   and as a consequence,
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.320]   decided to consume more of that plant.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   Now, these days we consume a lot of caffeine
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.000]   in the form of coffee and tea mainly,
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.340]   and some people consume it in the form of caffeine tablets
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.260]   or energy drinks, et cetera.
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:45.680]   Across the board, one finds that caffeine intake
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.960]   at a level of one to three milligrams per kilogram
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.220]   of body weight improves reaction time.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.960]   That is, it reduces the amount of time
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.720]   to take a physical action
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:58.720]   or to answer a question correctly
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.120]   with a verbal response.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.720]   It can also improve coordination,
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.720]   it can also improve memory,
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.660]   although I do want to mention that
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.480]   whereas most studies of the effects of caffeine
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.200]   on improving mental and physical performance
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.860]   involve taking caffeine at one to three milligrams
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.980]   per kilogram of body weight
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:20.600]   before the mental task or physical task,
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:24.560]   there is also a pro-performance effect of caffeine on memory
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.240]   if one takes caffeine after learning certain material,
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.920]   or I should say, being exposed to certain material.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.640]   We'll come back to that in a few minutes.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:39.200]   If one examines reaction time, mood, alertness,
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.520]   focus, and memory,
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.200]   or the ability to call up information from memory,
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.200]   or physical dexterity, power output, endurance,
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.420]   and overall feelings of wellbeing
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:56.560]   during exercise and exertion,
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:59.480]   caffeine has been shown in numerous studies
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.040]   in both men and women
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.280]   to improve all of those metrics significantly.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.800]   So this is all just to say that caffeine
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.280]   is an incredible performance-enhancing tool.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.480]   Now, what's not obvious from the statement
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.120]   that caffeine is a performance-enhancing tool
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.500]   across the board and in men and women
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.080]   and in different contexts
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.160]   is that the way in which caffeine is taken
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.240]   is very important.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.340]   Because 90% or more of adults consume caffeine,
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:33.160]   finding controls for studies of caffeine
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.160]   is really challenging.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.340]   That is, finding people who don't ingest caffeine regularly
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:40.440]   is a very challenging task for the researcher.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.600]   And as a consequence, many of the studies of caffeine
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.440]   on human beings involve depriving regular caffeine users
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.800]   of caffeine and then examining the effects of caffeine
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.100]   given after a period of, say, five to 15 days of abstinence
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:58.520]   in a person that is essentially experiencing
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.880]   mild withdrawal symptoms
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.140]   because they haven't had the caffeine
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:03.400]   that they were used to getting.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.640]   So this is an important point.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.740]   And it's a point that likely exacerbates
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.080]   the observed pro-performance effects of caffeine.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.120]   Now, all of that isn't necessarily a problem,
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.240]   provided you keep it in mind.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.500]   And it actually points to a way in which,
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.680]   even if you're a regular caffeine user,
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.160]   you can extract more of the benefits of caffeine.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.220]   The simplest way to do this, for instance,
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:28.440]   is to look back to what we talked about earlier
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:32.040]   in terms of the need to have most of your cortisol increase
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.400]   restricted to the hour or hours just after waking
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.380]   in terms of mood and alertness and performance.
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:41.800]   One of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.600]   early in the day is to consume caffeine
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.240]   shortly after that peak occurs.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.420]   And this was really nicely demonstrated
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.900]   in a study entitled caffeine stimulation
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.240]   of cortisol secretion across the waking hours
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.760]   in relation to caffeine intake levels.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.440]   We will provide a link to this study.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.260]   It's a somewhat complicated study
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.820]   because they looked at a bunch of different times of day
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:05.540]   for caffeine intake.
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.200]   And I should mention this study,
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.480]   they use this 300 milligrams per day
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.220]   or 600 milligrams per day.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.180]   So that's quite high,
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:14.380]   although for people of sufficient body weight
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:15.880]   and who are accustomed to taking caffeine,
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.220]   it's certainly not going to be in excess
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.480]   of what a lot of people out there are taking.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.400]   But basically what they observed was the following.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.040]   Cortisol responses to caffeine are reduced,
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.880]   but not eliminated in people who consume caffeine
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.160]   on a daily basis.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.120]   What this means is that if you wake up
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.000]   and as I recommended earlier,
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.880]   you avoid drinking caffeine for the first 90 to 120 minutes
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.900]   after waking, but you do get some sunlight
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.740]   or other bright light in your eyes in that time,
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:45.440]   maybe even get some exercise in that time,
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.880]   which would be even better.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.240]   And then you ingest caffeine,
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.720]   you will get a further increase in cortisol,
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.880]   which provided it's restricted
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.900]   to the early part of the day
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.600]   is a good thing overall for mood and alertness.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.980]   So this is a simple performance enhancing tool,
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.400]   which is to stack caffeine
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   on the tail of that early cortisol peak.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.800]   I should also mention however, that in this study,
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.260]   they had people do a five day caffeine abstinence
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.620]   prior to being tested with 300 milligrams
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.560]   or 600 milligrams of caffeine.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.520]   So the simple tool to extract from this
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.920]   and other studies like it,
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.280]   is that if you want to experience
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.440]   the maximum alertness promoting effects of caffeine
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.640]   when you adjust it early in the day,
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.220]   you would abstain from caffeine for five days
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.700]   and then ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.600]   I would still hope that you were doing all the other things
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.280]   that I described, morning sunlight exercise,
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.040]   et cetera, correctly, but regardless,
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.840]   it's very clear that a five day abstinence from caffeine,
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.760]   however painful that might be,
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.080]   will increase the performance enhancing effects
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.200]   of caffeine when you take caffeine on that sixth day.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.400]   Now, I'm sure many of you out there are saying,
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.780]   why would I ever want to abstain from caffeine
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:54.680]   for five days in order to just get this
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.120]   six day performance enhancing effect?
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.540]   Well, there are a couple of reasons for doing that.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:02.880]   Perhaps you're planning to travel to a new time zone
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.840]   and you want to use caffeine as a stimulant
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:07.340]   to stay up during the day in the new time zone.
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:09.100]   That's a somewhat unusual case.
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:10.440]   Others of you might be interested
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.760]   in the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.760]   We'll talk more about these in a little bit,
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:18.160]   but you want to get the maximum strength increase
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.620]   or the maximum endurance increase from ingesting,
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:25.020]   in this case, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.760]   Well, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.160]   will greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.800]   of caffeine when you take it on that sixth day.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   Although admittedly, those five days are likely
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.440]   to be pretty painful if you're a regular caffeine user.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.920]   Another variation on this, however,
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.580]   might be to have the amount of caffeine
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:44.680]   that you ingest on a daily basis
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:47.520]   and then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.540]   on that day in which you need the caffeine
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:51.960]   to really boost your mood, energy, and performance.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.800]   Another reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.780]   or reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.220]   and then go back to your regular caffeine intake
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:03.240]   is simply to identify how much of an effect caffeine
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.380]   is really having on your overall level
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:08.040]   of daily functioning and mood.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.420]   This was something that was actually covered
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.780]   in beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:14.180]   all about caffeine, it's available on Audible.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.320]   I really enjoyed that book.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.940]   It describes his experience with the decision
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.920]   to completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.880]   Although I confess that after hearing that book,
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.120]   what it basically made me want to do
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.800]   is never quit drinking caffeine because it sounded as if,
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.060]   at least my interpretation was,
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:33.240]   that even after several weeks or months
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.960]   of abstaining from caffeine,
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.080]   that he still fantasized about the effects of caffeine.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.560]   But he did mention that when returning to ingesting caffeine
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.500]   after a period of long abstinence, that it had almost a,
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:48.500]   let's not call it a psychedelic property,
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:53.420]   but it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:56.620]   and feelings of wellbeing that it really highlighted for him
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.220]   the extent to which caffeine normally was allowing him
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:01.340]   to just function what he thought was normally.
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.900]   So in other words, many of us don't even really know
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.740]   what our normal basal level
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.300]   of cognitive and physical functioning is
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.900]   because we're ingesting caffeine on such a regular basis.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.260]   I confess that as much as I enjoyed that book
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.960]   and as intriguing as his description of caffeine abstinence
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.940]   and then the return to caffeine was,
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.960]   I don't intend to ever find out personally.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.500]   Now, a very good reason why you might want to abstain
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.460]   from caffeine for a deliberate period of time
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:28.380]   and then return to caffeine intake
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:32.840]   is for its physical performance enhancing effects.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:35.700]   And here we can look to a really interesting study,
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.940]   title of which is "Time Course of Tolerance
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.420]   to the Performance Effects of Caffeine."
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.440]   And what I like about this study
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.760]   is that while yes, it does say that abstaining from caffeine
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.580]   and then returning to caffeine intake
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.620]   can enhance physical performance in a very specific way.
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:50.880]   It also says that if you take caffeine regularly,
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.160]   you can still see the physical performance
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.660]   enhancing effects of caffeine,
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.020]   although they are not quite as robust as they would be
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:40:59.700]   had you abstained from caffeine.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:03.920]   The design of the study is pretty straightforward.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.460]   They had people either ingest three milligrams
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.660]   per kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.460]   Many people are already doing that, I realize,
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.920]   but they had people do that
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.520]   or ensure that they were doing that,
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.620]   or others ingested a placebo for 20 days.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.680]   So they abstained from caffeine without realizing it.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.320]   Then after that 20 days of either ingesting caffeine
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:30.280]   or a placebo, their peak performance was measured
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.120]   in terms of aerobic output,
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.700]   but prior to that measurement, they had caffeine, okay?
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:38.060]   So it's 20 days of caffeine and then a 21st day of caffeine
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:40.760]   and then the physical task on that 21st day,
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.360]   or it's 20 days of abstinence from caffeine,
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.320]   and then on day 21, you get caffeine
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.880]   and you get the same physical test.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.480]   And what they discovered was that the ingestion of caffeine
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.600]   increased peak performance in this aerobic output
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.780]   dramatically if people had abstained from caffeine,
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:03.240]   but for people that had consumed caffeine
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.440]   all the way through up until that day,
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.020]   it still was effective to ingest caffeine on day 21,
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:12.520]   but not as effective as it would have been
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.160]   had they abstained.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.140]   And in fact, the magnitude of the,
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.540]   what they call ergogenic effect,
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:22.760]   which is the pro-performance enhancing effect of caffeine,
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.860]   was higher on the first day than in subsequent days
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.980]   when they allowed people to continue caffeine intake.
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.260]   So the takeaway from this study is really straightforward.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.440]   If you want to get the maximum physical performance
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.660]   enhancing effects of caffeine, you abstain from caffeine
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:39.280]   for 20 days, then on day 21,
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.160]   when you're going to do the physical thing, the task,
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:45.100]   you ingest caffeine about 30 minutes to an hour
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.560]   before you do that physical challenge.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.600]   Now, 20 days of abstinence is going to be rough
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.440]   for a lot of people.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.600]   I certainly don't want to sign up for this study,
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.920]   in which case you might want to do five days of abstinence
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.220]   as we talked about before.
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.740]   And then on day six is the day that you ingest caffeine
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.760]   and do the physical task.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.580]   There are even some studies showing that you can abstain
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.120]   from caffeine for just two days, for just 48 hours.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.100]   And in particular, if you are a regular user of caffeine,
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.800]   this allows you to, on day three,
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.720]   ingest caffeine at the dose that's appropriate for you
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.300]   and do the physical, or I should mention,
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:24.820]   mental performance task and perform significantly better
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.360]   than those that have been taking caffeine
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.160]   throughout the entire period leading up to the challenge.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.420]   So you don't necessarily need to abstain for 20 days
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.760]   in order to get the pro-performance effects of caffeine
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.780]   on day 21.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:38.480]   You could do five days of abstinence prior,
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.180]   or even two days of abstinence prior.
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:44.320]   Or if that's intolerable to you, as it is in my mind to me,
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.880]   to just reduce your caffeine intake slightly,
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.240]   or even perhaps have it, if you can tolerate that,
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.620]   in the week or two weeks, or maybe even three weeks
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:55.880]   preceding some physical or mental challenge.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.400]   Now, again, this sort of implies
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.400]   that you're going up against a marathon,
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.520]   or you're going up against a series of long tests,
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.680]   maybe standardized tests in one day.
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.200]   There, I just really want to point out
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.480]   that there is an abundant literature showing
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.440]   that people perform best on mental tests
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.320]   if they are in the state that they were
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.180]   when they studied for that material.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:19.020]   Now, in college, I knew a number of people
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.360]   who took this to the extreme,
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.960]   thinking that if they were to study
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.200]   under the effects of alcohol,
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:26.100]   that they would be best off consuming alcohol
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:29.160]   prior to taking exams, and it turns out to not be the case.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:30.720]   Here, we're talking, in particular,
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.400]   about psychostimulant effects of caffeine
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.740]   and other compounds.
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:36.880]   So don't think that you can drink
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:40.740]   or be under the influence of THC when you study,
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:42.620]   and then take an exam under the same influence
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:43.700]   and do just as well as you would
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.740]   had you not ingested anything.
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:46.620]   Please don't let that be the takeaway.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:49.360]   However, do let it be the takeaway
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.320]   that caffeine's effects are made more potent
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.080]   by a brief to not so brief period of abstinence
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.640]   prior to taking a dosage of caffeine.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.580]   And then the final point to make
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.600]   is that if you are somebody
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.680]   who is not accustomed to drinking caffeine,
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:04.320]   meaning you're hypersensitive to caffeine
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.280]   or you don't regularly ingest caffeine,
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.960]   please do not ingest caffeine
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.920]   on the day of any important mental
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.560]   or physical challenge or performance,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.820]   because what you will find
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.160]   is that because you are not caffeine adapted,
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:18.320]   you will experience changes in your thermal regulation,
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.800]   in your levels of anxiety and jitteriness,
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.800]   and your levels of focus that could be very detrimental
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.760]   to mental or physical performance.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.480]   So you don't want to throw yourself in the deep end
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.600]   by ingesting caffeine if you're not used to it.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   And I should mention that for people
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.060]   that are not accustomed to ingesting caffeine
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:35.720]   or are very sensitive to caffeine,
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.320]   even 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.440]   in the amount that's found in, for instance,
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.480]   a piece of certain types of chocolate
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.120]   can actually cause anxiety.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.420]   So be careful there.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.680]   Here I'm referring only to people
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.940]   that are accustomed with caffeine intake.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:51.600]   So what I recommend is to explore
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:54.960]   the ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training,
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:58.260]   and then to make a decision about what you can reasonably
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:00.180]   and reliably do in terms of abstinence,
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:04.120]   and then pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.840]   I get a lot of questions as to whether or not
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.940]   caffeine has different effects on the nervous system
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.640]   and on performance in particular,
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.480]   depending on phases of the menstrual cycle.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.680]   So I explored that in my research for this episode,
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:15.880]   and I found two studies,
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:18.320]   both of which we will reference in the show note captions.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.680]   The first one is entitled
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:22.640]   Caffeine Consumption and Menstrual Function.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:23.960]   So it's actually the relationship
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.540]   between caffeine and menstrual function.
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:26.760]   We will do an entire episode
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.080]   about the menstrual cycle and menstrual function.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.820]   But the other one, as it relates to performance,
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:34.200]   was published in 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition,
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.920]   which is ergogenic effects of caffeine
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:39.300]   on peak aerobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle.
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:41.340]   And the basic takeaway of this study,
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.840]   this is frankly a very nice study,
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.100]   showed that quote,
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:48.020]   "Caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:50.760]   in the early follicular, pre-ovulatory,
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.740]   and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.100]   Thus the ingestion," and again here,
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.660]   they use three milligrams of caffeine
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:58.020]   per kilogram of body mass,
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:02.360]   might be considered an ergogenic aid
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.320]   for women who are in the menstrual cycle
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.220]   during all three phases of their cycle.
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:09.340]   So keep that in mind, women,
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:11.540]   for those of you that are regular users of caffeine,
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.400]   or you're using caffeine to enhance physical performance,
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.620]   there does not seem to be
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:18.940]   any menstrual cycle phase dependent effects
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:20.200]   of caffeine on performance.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.020]   That is caffeine seems to always increase physical performance
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:26.280]   regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.280]   you might happen to be in.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:29.200]   I'd like to touch on a little bit more
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.120]   of the use of caffeine for enhancing mental performance.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:37.000]   Yes, it is the case that ingesting one to three milligrams
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.100]   of caffeine per kilogram of body weight
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:42.840]   in the 30 minutes or so prior to doing a memory task,
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:45.600]   or sitting down to doing some studying,
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.760]   or learning of any kind,
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.620]   physical or mental performance of any kind is beneficial
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:53.860]   for all the reasons we talked about before
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:57.080]   related to dopamine and acetylcholine, et cetera.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:00.280]   But it turns out that it is also the case
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.320]   that spiking one's adrenaline
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.880]   and other so-called catecholamines,
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.720]   so this would be dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.500]   after about of learning can greatly enhance memory
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.440]   for the information that one was trying to learn.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.460]   That's right.
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:19.100]   Spiking your adrenaline after learning
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:20.860]   can greatly increase memory
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.840]   for the material you're trying to learn.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.220]   In fact, this is a practice that dates back centuries
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:29.940]   and was written about in a beautiful annual review
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:33.660]   of neuroscience on the biology of memory by James McGaugh,
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:35.980]   where he talks about medieval practices
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:38.480]   of children being taught information
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:41.500]   and then being thrown literally into cold water
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.580]   to stimulate the release of adrenaline
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:47.080]   and that increase in adrenaline while the mechanism
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.480]   wasn't completely understood,
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.680]   it was understood that that sort of shock to the system
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:55.340]   from the cold water led to better memory
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:57.640]   and retention of the information
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.220]   that these children had been exposed to.
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:02.120]   And it turns out the exact same thing is true for adults
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.140]   in the laboratory or kids in the laboratory.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:05.960]   And here, I'm not suggesting throwing anyone
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:06.800]   into cold water.
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:08.120]   If you want to get into cold water,
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:10.680]   there's a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:12.800]   on the podcast is that it should be deliberate
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.020]   and controlled by you, not by somebody else.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.160]   If it's controlled by somebody else,
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.120]   that might be military screening or something.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:22.980]   But here we're talking about deliberately increasing
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.940]   your levels of adrenaline and other catecholamines,
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:28.240]   dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.920]   You can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:34.040]   with a cold shower or getting in up to your neck
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.360]   in cold water of any kind.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.500]   But the other way to do that is to spike your adrenaline
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:42.900]   by ingesting a one to three milligrams per kilogram
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:46.380]   of caffeine after sitting down
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.860]   to try and learn some material.
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.900]   I confess that more often than not,
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.160]   I use caffeine the same way that most people use it,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.700]   which is, okay, I'm going to sit down,
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:56.480]   I'm going to research information for a podcast
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.100]   or assemble some information for a paper or grant.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.700]   And I want to focus, so I will drink a cup of coffee
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.580]   at the beginning of that and maybe even throughout that,
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:09.060]   or a cup of Yerba Mate at the beginning or throughout that,
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:13.060]   or I'll sip on one or both throughout trying to learn.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.760]   And that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:20.520]   and alertness and retention of information.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.220]   But it is indeed the case,
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:24.120]   that is the research supports the fact,
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:26.500]   and I've experienced the fact that if I abstained
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.940]   from caffeine while I'm trying to learn something,
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.100]   but then I drink caffeine immediately after,
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.740]   somewhat surprisingly to me,
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:36.060]   but certainly in a way that's consistent
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:37.740]   with the research literature,
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.240]   memory for the information that I was focused on
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:45.020]   prior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.860]   And here I'm talking about it as a personal anecdote,
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:48.420]   but this is actually what the data point to
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.820]   both in animals and in humans.
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:53.020]   And if you think about it, it makes perfect sense,
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:56.220]   because the way that the memory systems
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.300]   of the brain are organized is that
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:00.220]   we go through life experiencing things,
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.780]   we encounter surprises, both good and bad,
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.060]   we go through the motions of things,
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:10.060]   both typical mundane, exciting and novel and not novel.
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.660]   And then every once in a while,
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.420]   something will happen that will spike our catecholamines,
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.020]   dopamine, typically if it's a positive surprise,
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.660]   adrenaline, which can be associated
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:23.420]   with both positive surprise or positive events
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:26.540]   and negative events or surprises.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:31.460]   And without fail, increases in the catecholamines
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:35.580]   tend to lock in memories for things that preceded
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.160]   the increase in those catecholamines.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:39.100]   Again, the catecholamines being dopamine,
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.380]   epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:41.980]   sometimes all three in combination,
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.100]   sometimes just two of those,
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:46.340]   sometimes just one of those, depending on the experience.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:49.500]   So it makes perfect sense that using caffeine
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:53.560]   at the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.520]   for the information that we're trying to learn.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.620]   So if you decide that you want to try and
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:00.500]   extract this performance enhancing effect of caffeine,
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:04.900]   what I recommend would be to try and abstain from caffeine
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:06.060]   for a day or two prior.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:06.900]   But if you can't,
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:09.360]   to just continue with your normal caffeine intake.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.140]   But then when you sit down to study or learn something
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:15.980]   to not ingest any caffeine as you do that,
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:18.160]   but then afterward to ingest caffeine.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.500]   Now, in theory, you could probably further enhance
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.300]   the memory encoding effects of adrenaline
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:25.900]   and the other catecholamines by drinking caffeine
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.980]   and then taking a cold shower,
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:29.340]   doing deliberate cold exposure
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.500]   if you really wanted to or had the ability to,
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:34.860]   or doing some sort of intense form of exercise.
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:38.100]   And we'll talk in a moment about how caffeine exercise
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.180]   and the adrenaline system interact.
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:42.800]   But as a brief, but relevant aside,
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.740]   brief bouts of intense exercise,
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:47.700]   ranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so,
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:51.180]   have been shown to improve memory for information
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:54.100]   that one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:58.000]   This is work from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU,
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.940]   as well as other laboratories.
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.120]   Some of the work that's being done at Stanford
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.700]   and the mind-body laboratories
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.540]   and our laboratory points in the direction
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:08.780]   of these kinds of effects as well.
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:13.040]   They all come back to the same general neurochemical theme,
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.780]   which is that when we experience an increase
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:18.780]   in these catecholamines that include adrenaline,
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:21.060]   dopamine and norepinephrine,
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:23.840]   the memory systems of the brain flip on
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.140]   in a way that try to capture the information
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.460]   and the perceptions and the experiences
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.720]   that we were exposed to just prior
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.620]   to the increase in catecholamines.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:37.400]   And caffeine, but also exercise and also cold water,
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:41.300]   and of course, any of those alone or in combination,
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:43.400]   all increase the levels of catecholamines.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.200]   So it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.780]   as to why this would work, and in fact, it does work.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.400]   If you want to remember specific information,
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.920]   you might consider using caffeine
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.560]   as you move through and absorb
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.220]   and are exposed to that information,
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:59.500]   but you might also consider using caffeine
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.400]   after being exposed to that information,
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.760]   because studies in animals and humans show
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:06.480]   that that is a potent way to increase memory
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.320]   for what you were just exposed to.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.000]   I should mention that what I just described
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.760]   also pushes back on something
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.600]   that I know a number of people perhaps have heard about
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:17.740]   and maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino.
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.300]   I remember hearing about this a few years back.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:22.880]   It was a sort of trend, if you will.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.200]   The trend involved drinking a cup of coffee
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.900]   or double espresso and then going down for a nap,
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.740]   typically in the afternoon, and then waking up,
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:32.160]   and the idea was that the caffeine would hit your system
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:34.000]   right at the time that you awake from the nap
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.880]   and that you would be better able to focus and exercise.
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.280]   There are a couple of things about that practice
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.240]   that I don't like.
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.600]   First of all, it implies in most cases
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.480]   that you're napping and ingesting caffeine in the afternoon,
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.520]   which I realize for many students
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.920]   and for people that are comfortable staying up
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.400]   until the wee hours of the night
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.500]   and then waking up late the next day
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:59.000]   might be compatible with their schedule.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.500]   But again, because of the sleep diminishing effects
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:05.460]   of caffeine, and we talked about earlier,
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:08.040]   I'm not crazy about the idea of people ingesting caffeine
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.080]   in the late afternoon
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.040]   in order to perform better in the late afternoon.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.020]   Far better would be to restrict caffeine intake
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.460]   to the early part of the day, as we talked about earlier.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.360]   The other reason is that the data
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.360]   on things like non-sleep deep rest
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.020]   and naps in the afternoon.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:27.440]   And again, the rule here is that you don't have to nap,
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.560]   but if you want to nap,
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:31.440]   it's been shown that naps of 90 minutes or less
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.400]   or non-sleep deep rest protocols,
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.440]   and you can find those, for instance,
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:35.840]   there's one with me speaking,
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.480]   you just put NSDR Huberman into YouTube.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.180]   You can hear that it's completely zero cost.
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:42.440]   There are other NSDR scripts out there now, of course,
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.120]   if you prefer those,
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.560]   that those can all lead to increases
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.820]   in one of the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:54.300]   That's been shown in a really nice
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:55.780]   neurotransmitter labeling study,
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:57.960]   not from my laboratory, but from another laboratory,
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.460]   but also can improve mood focus and alertness on its own
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:03.340]   without the need to ingest caffeine
[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:05.260]   prior to going into those states.
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:07.820]   And in fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:10.420]   or ingesting caffeine prior to NSDR
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:14.200]   is most certainly going to reduce the effectiveness
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.340]   of that nap and NSDR in restoring natural levels
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:18.620]   of alertness and focus
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:20.320]   that would lead to the performance enhancing effect.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.840]   So I'm not such a fan of the so-called nappuccino,
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.220]   although if any of you out there
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.980]   have derived great benefit from it,
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:27.740]   definitely let me know your protocol
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:28.760]   and what you've experienced.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:31.800]   Put it in the comment section, if you would.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.060]   I'd appreciate that.
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:36.040]   There's another very important and potent use of caffeine
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:37.480]   for enhancing performance.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:42.260]   And this relates not just to the dopamine and epinephrine
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.840]   and the arousal inducing effects of caffeine.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.060]   And it doesn't even just relate to the effect of caffeine
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:51.640]   on enhancing frontal lobe function.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.040]   It does include all that,
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:56.820]   but it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.960]   that we talked about at the beginning of the episode.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.880]   And the best way to illustrate
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.320]   these performance enhancing effects of caffeine
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:09.020]   that stem directly from its association with reinforcement
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.460]   is to highlight a study.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.040]   And the title of the study is a blood dopamine level
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:16.440]   enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:19.100]   And as the title suggests, this was carried out in men,
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:22.040]   but there's no reason to think that the same results
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:24.240]   wouldn't also be present in women.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.540]   There are some sex dependent effects of caffeine.
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.300]   I'll touch on just briefly at the end,
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:31.480]   but those are largely present in kids,
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.120]   that is adolescents and teens, as opposed to adults.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.920]   So this study is really interesting.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.820]   What they had people do was run on a treadmill
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:42.520]   and either ingest caffeine, again,
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:45.560]   three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:47.760]   or to not ingest caffeine.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:50.640]   And then they looked at levels of dopamine
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.240]   and other neurotransmitters and hormones
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:55.380]   such as prolactin and cortisol.
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:58.400]   And the basic takeaway is, as the title suggests,
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.380]   that exercise while on its own can increase cortisol
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:06.040]   in healthy ways provided it's not too intense and too long.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:09.000]   Little note here, if you have trouble recovering
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.040]   from exercise, or you want to continue to derive
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.960]   the benefits from exercise, in general,
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:16.020]   best not to do high intensity exercise
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:19.380]   for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes,
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:20.580]   I'll be in the outer threshold.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.620]   I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:23.940]   or people that are chemically assisted
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.560]   that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise,
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:30.760]   but most people don't do well,
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:33.480]   long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:38.100]   and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less,
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:40.220]   that doesn't include the warmup, is going to be beneficial.
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:43.060]   See the episode on a toolkit for fitness
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.560]   if you'd like details on that.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:49.540]   Exercise is known to increase levels of dopamine, cortisol,
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:53.760]   and other catecholamines and neurotransmitters very potently
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:55.680]   and things like testosterone and estrogen
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:57.080]   in ways that we know are beneficial to us.
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.040]   And of course have all these positive effects
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:02.280]   on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:05.240]   But unbeknownst to most people,
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:08.680]   ingesting three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:12.680]   prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:15.440]   associated with exercise specifically.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:17.260]   And this has two important effects.
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:19.880]   First of all, that increase in dopamine is great
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:22.840]   because it provides a long lasting increase
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:24.760]   in focus alertness and motivation,
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:28.880]   not just during the exercise, but also after the exercise.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:33.880]   And second, it, that is caffeine and dopamine in combination
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:38.880]   act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.880]   and the period immediate after exercise
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.360]   more pleasant and in fact reinforcing.
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.900]   So in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.960]   and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:55.320]   and to experience a genuine increase in dopamine
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:58.080]   that's beneficial for mood and alertness
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:02.200]   is to ingest caffeine prior to exercise.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:05.760]   Now, this is important because a number of people out there
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.900]   are exercising, love exercise, love eating great,
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:11.380]   love doing all the things that are beneficial
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:13.500]   for their health, but a number of people out there
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.380]   really don't like to exercise.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:20.020]   And that serves as a serious block for their willingness
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:22.160]   and their consistency to exercise.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:28.200]   Ingesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise.
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:31.480]   It increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:33.460]   that are good for us during exercise.
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:35.600]   But as I'm highlighting here,
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.600]   it also increases the reinforcement pathways
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.840]   associated with exercise.
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:44.800]   That is, it creates a positive feeling
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.280]   about the general theme of engaging in exercise
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:51.460]   and it creates a general positive experience
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.580]   of the things that follow exercise.
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:57.700]   So I think this, if nothing else is a call for
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.420]   or support for the idea that ingesting caffeine
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:03.460]   as a performance enhancing tool makes perfect sense.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:06.140]   But for those out there that don't enjoy exercise,
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:08.580]   in particular, certain forms of exercise,
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:11.840]   ingesting caffeine can change your relationship
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.260]   to that exercise.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.740]   In other words, make it more positive.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:17.920]   Much in the same way that ingesting caffeine
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.760]   alongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.440]   or maybe even negative can actually make the taste
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.780]   of that particular drink or food positive.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:28.340]   So again, this brings us back to the reinforcing properties
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.640]   of caffeine that are subconscious.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.300]   It's not just about the enhanced performance in the test
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:36.620]   or the enhanced performance on the treadmill
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:38.580]   or with the weights in the gym.
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.540]   It's enhanced feelings of mood and wellbeing
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:43.180]   that are genuine because of the effect of caffeine
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:45.900]   on certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems.
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:48.820]   But it also is creating an overall milieu
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:51.980]   of reinforcing all of the things that led into
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.460]   occur during and occur after exercise.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.560]   I do want to point out something that's very important
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:01.700]   as it relates to combining things like caffeine
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:03.980]   and exercise in order to increase dopamine.
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:05.780]   This is something that came up in the episode
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:08.340]   that I did on dopamine motivation and drive,
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:11.140]   which turns out to be one of our most popular episodes.
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:13.340]   Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:15.780]   and links to all formats with timestamps, et cetera.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:18.920]   This also came up in the episode on ADHD
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.540]   because of the relationship between ADHD and dopamine.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:24.620]   And that's this notion of dopamine stacking.
[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:27.900]   In the episode on dopamine motivation and drive,
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:31.060]   I pointed out that while there are a near infinite number
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:34.020]   of things that can increase dopamine release,
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:39.020]   most notably positive surprise or positive anticipation
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:42.980]   or experiencing a win, certainly there are compounds,
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:47.720]   both drugs of abuse, food, sex, and certain supplements
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:49.700]   that can increase dopamine to varying levels
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:52.840]   and to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy.
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:54.120]   That's all contained in that episode
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:55.940]   on dopamine motivation and drive.
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:58.240]   But what I pointed out is that if you are somebody
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:02.140]   who tends to experience difficulty with motivation,
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:05.120]   that so-called dopamine stacking, as I called it,
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.600]   might be something that you want to avoid.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.660]   What is dopamine stacking?
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:12.060]   Dopamine stacking would be combining a highly caffeinated
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:15.460]   energy drink that also includes the amino acid tyrosine,
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.260]   which is a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music,
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:19.700]   plus getting yourself really ramped up
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:21.220]   then in an intense workout.
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:24.860]   All of that can be great if you do it every once in a while.
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:27.860]   But what you will quickly find is that the extent
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:31.580]   to which your dopamine peaks also dictates
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:34.660]   the extent to which your dopamine will drop after that peak.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:37.000]   And when I say drop, I mean drop below baseline.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.100]   So a lot of people find that if they stack a lot of things
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:42.900]   to peak their dopamine, then they experience a low,
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:45.780]   and it does take some time for them to return to baseline.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:49.520]   And I highly recommend not engaging in activities
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.340]   or consuming compounds that are in attempt
[02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:54.980]   to accelerate that return to baseline,
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:57.140]   because all it will do is drive that baseline
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:58.540]   lower and lower.
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:00.540]   So this requires being able to tolerate a drop
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:03.180]   in dopamine baseline for a period of time, et cetera.
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.540]   Now, the reason I'm bringing this up now
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:06.300]   in the context of this caffeine episode
[02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:09.760]   is I just described a study in which using caffeine prior
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:12.420]   to exercise increases dopamine after exercise.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.540]   And so you might be saying,
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:16.000]   especially if you heard that earlier episode,
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.020]   wait, isn't that dopamine stacking?
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:20.580]   Aren't you encouraging me to stack my dopamine?
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:22.820]   Well, in some sense, yes, but keep in mind,
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.460]   I'm not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise.
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.300]   So just as in that earlier episode,
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:31.940]   I emphasized the fact that while stacking multiple stimuli,
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:35.220]   right, caffeine or energy drinks and music and et cetera,
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:38.300]   for exercise or for mental work,
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:40.200]   or for any experience for that matter,
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.540]   is okay to do every once in a while for most people,
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:45.280]   you don't want to get in the habit of doing it consistently
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.780]   every time you exercise or every time you go out,
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:49.620]   for instance.
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:51.540]   And so you really want to be cautious.
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.820]   That is, you want to protect your both baseline levels
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:57.080]   of dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine.
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:59.300]   That said, for people that want to experience
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:01.620]   an increase in mood alertness and performance,
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:03.340]   or who want to condition themselves,
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:04.460]   because that's really what it is,
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:06.940]   it's conditioning yourself by the reinforcing effects
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:11.940]   of dopamine to increase your liking,
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:14.360]   or maybe even your loving of exercise,
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:18.000]   occasionally using caffeine or frequently using caffeine
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.240]   prior to exercise is fine, but be very careful.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:23.780]   And by being very careful, what I mean is pay attention
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:27.000]   to how you feel in the hours and days after
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.740]   that dopamine increase wears off.
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:32.520]   So for instance, if you ingest caffeine
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.760]   and then exercise very intensely
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.220]   and you're feeling great afterwards,
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:38.540]   but then eight hours later or the next day,
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:40.180]   you're feeling a little bit low,
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:41.300]   I suggest you don't go back
[02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:42.780]   and do the exact same thing right away.
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:44.700]   I would give you yourself a little bit of time
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:48.180]   to let that baseline of dopamine return to normal.
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:52.140]   So again, stacking different things, chemical and behavioral
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:55.040]   in order to increase dopamine can be done in a safe way
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:57.300]   that's beneficial to you depending on your goals,
[02:05:57.300 --> 02:06:01.000]   but be careful about not stacking too many stimuli
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.800]   for dopamine too often, that's the key.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.860]   Early in the episode, I mentioned one possible
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:10.100]   caffeine consuming schedule that works very well
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:14.600]   that doesn't fortunately subject you to long 20 day bouts
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.100]   or five day or even two day bouts of abstinence.
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:20.300]   And that's the every other day schedule of caffeine.
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:22.860]   If you look at the half-life of caffeine
[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:26.060]   and you look at its effects on the dopamine system
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:28.340]   and its performance enhancing effects
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:31.140]   and how a period of abstinence can in fact
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.340]   increase the performance enhancing effects of caffeine,
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:35.340]   but also take into consideration
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:37.300]   that caffeine can be habit forming
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:40.460]   and we can develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine.
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:43.060]   Well, then what emerges from all of that
[02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:48.060]   is that being a person who consumes caffeine every other day
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.420]   can actually help you maximize
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:52.460]   most of the positive effects of caffeine
[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:55.240]   without subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:58.200]   if you're accustomed to consuming caffeine every single day
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:02.200]   and then suddenly go into a two or five or 20 day abstinence.
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.660]   So I myself have never tried
[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:06.320]   an every other day caffeine approach,
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:08.260]   although I'm considering doing it
[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:10.260]   based on the literature that I've read.
[02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.360]   And I'm considering doing it in a very specific way,
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.340]   which will be to only consume caffeine
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:15.980]   on the days in which I resistance train.
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.480]   And since I tend to do that about three or four days per week
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:20.020]   organized in a way that's every other day.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.980]   Again, if you want to see the exercise schedule
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:24.100]   that I follow, including cardiovascular exercise
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:26.260]   and weight training and all the reasons
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:28.060]   and rationale for what I do
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:31.100]   and how it maps onto the scientific literature
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:33.800]   related to health span and life span, vitality, et cetera,
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:35.740]   you can find that at Hubermanlab.com.
[02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:37.400]   And we had a toolkit for fitness
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:40.880]   that ought to be posted to our website before long.
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:43.140]   The every other day schedule of caffeine intake
[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:45.400]   to me seems like the most rational one
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.220]   if one wants to maximize
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:49.260]   on the performance enhancing effects of caffeine
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:52.860]   without suffering the effects of caffeine withdrawal
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:56.040]   that are associated with being a regular consumer of caffeine
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.620]   and then stopping caffeine intake
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:00.500]   such as headache and irritability and so forth.
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:02.100]   Not I nor anyone in my life
[02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:03.740]   wants me to experience those effects.
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:05.260]   And I'm sure you don't want to experience
[02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.920]   those effects for you either.
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:08.160]   So if you're somebody that decides
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:10.500]   to try the every other day protocol,
[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:13.260]   or you are somebody who's already doing that protocol,
[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:16.580]   please let me know what your experiences with that are.
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:18.900]   At least by my read of the literature on caffeine
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:20.340]   and its performance enhancing effects,
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:22.140]   but also the effects of caffeine
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:24.800]   on neurotransmitter and hormone systems,
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:26.940]   the every other day caffeine's schedule
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:28.980]   does seem to be the most rational
[02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:30.740]   and scientifically grounded one
[02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:32.980]   in order to maximize on all those effects.
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.000]   In addition to so-called
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.060]   performance enhancing effects of caffeine,
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:38.380]   there are also the well-studied
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:42.220]   and now fairly well mechanistically understood
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:43.980]   pro-health effects of caffeine.
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:47.780]   Now here when I talk about pro-health effects of caffeine,
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.340]   I want to be very clear
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:52.820]   that if your schedule of caffeine intake,
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:54.580]   that is your timing of caffeine intake
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:57.220]   or anything else for that matter,
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:09:01.020]   offsets getting regular high quality sleep
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:02.340]   of sufficient duration,
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:03.480]   well then you are undermining
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:05.360]   the pro-health effects of that thing.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.540]   This is true for exercise, this is true for caffeine,
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:08.740]   this is true for supplementation,
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:10.940]   this is true for prescription drugs.
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:12.900]   Again, you don't want to be neurotically attached
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:14.780]   to the idea that you have to get perfect sleep every night
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.600]   because that's simply not true,
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.000]   but it is absolutely the case that anything,
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.820]   whether or not it's good for you or bad for you
[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:24.680]   in the short term, that disrupts your sleep
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.500]   because of the timing in which you're doing that thing
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:29.500]   is going to undermine your immediate
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:31.600]   and long-term health before long.
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.300]   So with that said,
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.820]   there are several well-described
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:39.060]   health promoting effects of caffeine ingestion.
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:42.140]   And once again, when I say caffeine ingestion,
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:44.420]   I'm referring to that one to three milligrams per kilogram
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:45.780]   of body weight dosage.
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:48.300]   There are really nice studies showing
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:51.140]   that being a regular consumer of caffeine
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:54.560]   can help offset some of the probability,
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:57.640]   some of the probability of developing Parkinson's
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.800]   and maybe Alzheimer's related dementia as well.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.900]   These are not terribly controversial data
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:04.880]   because of the fact that caffeine is known
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:07.860]   to increase the release of those catecholamines,
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.720]   dopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:11.740]   as well as acetylcholine.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:14.320]   All those neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:17.860]   are the ones that are known to be defective
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:19.240]   in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:21.900]   although there are other transmitter and hormone systems
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:23.620]   that are defective as well.
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:26.540]   There are beautiful reviews on the neuroprotective effects
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:29.200]   of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.140]   They're quite extensive and I'll just refer you to one
[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:33.400]   and the references they're in,
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:35.300]   and we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:39.320]   The title as the topic at hand suggests
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.040]   is the neuroprotective effects of caffeine
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:42.640]   and neurodegenerative diseases.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.500]   This was published in 2016.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.780]   I'm sure there've been other reviews since then,
[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:49.500]   but it includes many, many quality references
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:51.200]   and studies, both in animals and in humans,
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.020]   pointing to the fact that specific enzymes
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.780]   that are associated with the health
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:59.620]   of in particular dopamine neurons are made more robust
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:02.060]   by regular ingestion of caffeine.
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.900]   It also points to the fact that the increase
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:07.460]   in dopamine receptors that is induced
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:11.080]   by regular ingestion of caffeine that I referred to earlier
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.380]   is another way in which dopamine,
[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:15.820]   however many dopamine neurons remain around
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:18.020]   in people with Parkinson's or people who are aging
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:20.280]   that lose dopamine neurons naturally,
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:23.520]   that dopamine can have its maximal effect
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:26.020]   because of the increase in receptors for dopamine
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:28.020]   that caffeine induces.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:30.560]   And there are other biological mechanisms
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.040]   that further support why caffeine
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.340]   ought to be neuroprotective,
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:37.720]   including its effects on the acetylcholine system,
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:40.340]   which is one of the major systems disrupted
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:42.160]   in Alzheimer's dementia.
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.540]   So in other words, it makes perfect sense
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:46.000]   as to why caffeine would be neuroprotective.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.740]   Caffeine has also been shown to diminish headache,
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:50.960]   particularly when taken in combination with aspirin,
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.780]   and that's because of the effects of caffeine
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.180]   and aspirin on blood flow.
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:57.100]   There's also evidence that caffeine can provide brief
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.460]   but substantial relief from asthma.
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:01.440]   So I wouldn't want people to rely on caffeine
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.440]   as a life-saving approach to an asthmatic attack.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:09.380]   That said, for people that suffer from minor asthma,
[02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:11.220]   that caffeine intake, again,
[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:12.860]   of the dosages that we talked about before,
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:16.060]   has been shown to alleviate some of the major symptoms
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:18.300]   of asthma for anywhere from one to four hours.
[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:21.260]   And I know this is of relevance
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:22.720]   to a lot of people out there,
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:26.640]   because caffeine increases the catecholamines,
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:27.480]   and in particular,
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.540]   because caffeine increases dopamine transmission
[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:32.080]   in the prefrontal cortex,
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:34.380]   this area of the brain associated with focus
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:37.860]   and rule setting and context and task switching,
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:42.080]   caffeine is known to improve focus and alertness,
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.380]   in particular, in people who have symptoms of ADHD
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:50.140]   or other attention and focus issues.
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:54.060]   Now, caffeine alone does not appear to be as potent
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:57.520]   for the treatment of ADHD as are things like Ritalin,
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.560]   Adderall, modafinil, and armodafinil, and Vyvanse.
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:04.460]   If you would like a sort of head by head comparison
[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:09.460]   of prescription drugs, supplements, and things like caffeine,
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:12.840]   as well as coverage of behavioral tools
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.860]   and nutritional tools, et cetera,
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:19.060]   that can positively offset some of the symptoms of ADHD,
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:20.940]   please see the episode that I did on ADHD.
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:23.940]   Again, that's available at hubermanlab.com in all formats.
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:26.340]   But that said, caffeine does increase focus,
[02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:28.060]   and it does it through a number of different mechanisms,
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:30.800]   not the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:33.720]   in the forebrain, just as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:36.220]   would, although not to the same extent
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:38.620]   as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall does.
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:41.720]   Before we close today, I do want to just briefly return
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:43.840]   to the reinforcing effects of caffeine
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:45.580]   that we talked about earlier.
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:47.420]   This study on the honeybees that showed that
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:50.300]   bees prefer certain nectars because they contain caffeine,
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:51.820]   even though they are not aware
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:53.780]   that those nectars contain caffeine.
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:55.380]   They just come to like the feeling
[02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:57.780]   that those nectars provide them so much
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:01.200]   that they associate that in a subconscious way
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:02.460]   with the flowers themselves,
[02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.580]   and they come to like those flowers.
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:05.900]   Or human beings, for instance,
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:08.260]   children that ingest caffeinated beverages
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:11.540]   come to adore the taste of those beverages.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:13.720]   And beautiful studies have been done
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:16.920]   that describe how children and adults
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.060]   truly cannot distinguish between the taste
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:21.360]   of a caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverage.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:25.700]   And caffeine can be placed into essentially any beverage
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:29.200]   in order to give us a preference for that beverage or food.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.400]   In fact, the studies have been done with yogurt.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.980]   If you put caffeine into yogurt of different flavors,
[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:39.460]   even plain yogurt, which most kids don't like,
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:42.620]   they will come to prefer whatever flavor
[02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:44.320]   contain the caffeine,
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:47.080]   even if then you remove the caffeine from that flavor.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.980]   Now, eventually their preference for that flavor
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.300]   will be extinguished.
[02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:52.340]   But all of this is just to say
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.220]   that so many of the things that we like,
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:56.380]   whether or not it's coffee or tea,
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:59.600]   or a given flavor of food, or a given experience,
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:00.900]   or even exercise,
[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:03.820]   occur because we ingest caffeine
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:06.700]   in conjunction with those activities.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:08.220]   Now, these are not tricks
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:09.460]   that your nervous system plays on you.
[02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:12.540]   These are real neurochemical reinforcing effects.
[02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:14.780]   And I think that we would all do well
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:18.040]   to think about and to leverage these reinforcing effects,
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:19.620]   much in the same way we would do well
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.980]   to think about and hopefully not leverage
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.340]   aversive effects of certain compounds, right?
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:27.060]   The simple way to put this is,
[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:30.180]   I or anyone could get you to dislike something,
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:32.280]   someone, or someplace
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:36.740]   by making you feel slightly less good, lower mood.
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:38.060]   I don't even have to make you feel nauseous,
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:41.420]   but less good after ingesting something
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:43.460]   or having a certain kind of interaction
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:45.220]   or being in a certain environment.
[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:46.940]   Very straightforward to do that
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:48.300]   because of the way that your nervous system
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.680]   is wired for conditioning.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:52.780]   However, there's the positive side of all this,
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:54.540]   which is that it's very straightforward
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:58.060]   to reinforce the experience of a given food,
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:15:59.980]   including its taste, but all the context around it,
[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:01.700]   the container, the texture,
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:02.780]   the people you consume it with,
[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:04.480]   where you consume it, et cetera.
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:09.980]   For instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:11.860]   with broccoli.
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:13.060]   And here, I'm not suggesting
[02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:15.020]   that people actually do that experiment
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:18.040]   or play that trick on people.
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.560]   But you have to sort of imagine
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:23.700]   that if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer
[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:25.160]   of all sorts of things,
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.900]   in particular things that we ingest
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:28.840]   and would want to ingest more of
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:30.680]   if it's paired with caffeine,
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:33.500]   well, then you actually can use caffeine as a tool
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.820]   to increase reinforcement of different things.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.320]   And you can avoid caffeine
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.280]   as a way to further reinforce things
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:42.340]   that you would like to stop.
[02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:43.860]   And here, I'd like to just give the example
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:44.940]   of sugar cravings.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:47.260]   A lot of people ask me, "How do I avoid sugar cravings?"
[02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:49.540]   I've talked about the use of L-glutamine for that.
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:50.440]   I've talked about making sure
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.760]   you're getting enough essential fatty acids
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:54.200]   and essential amino acids
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.840]   as a way to reduce sugar cravings.
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:00.140]   Please note, however, that if you are somebody
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:02.380]   who likes to have your sugar,
[02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:03.680]   whether or not it's a piece of chocolate
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:04.740]   or your dessert, et cetera,
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:05.860]   I'm not saying that's bad,
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:08.700]   but if you're trying to reduce your sugar cravings,
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:12.360]   ask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine?
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:13.500]   Could be the caffeine contained
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:15.480]   in that sugar containing food like chocolate,
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:17.400]   or it could be that you're having a cup of coffee
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:18.340]   along with your pastry,
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:20.660]   and then you're struggling with sugar cravings.
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:21.500]   Well, think about it.
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.620]   You're not just being reinforced by the sugar
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:24.960]   and the effects of sugar on dopamine,
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:27.800]   which are real and both conscious and subconscious
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:29.600]   through the gut to the brain dopamine system
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.140]   and direct on the brain dopamine system.
[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:34.360]   But by co-ingesting caffeine,
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.000]   you are also further enhancing
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.300]   the reinforcing effects of sugar.
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:42.240]   The flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:45.120]   as a way to increase your appetite for certain things.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:46.080]   I actually know somebody,
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.540]   I won't reveal who this person is,
[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:49.840]   but they are quite prominent podcaster
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:54.040]   who ingests 125 to 150 milligrams of caffeine
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:56.580]   in tablet form, in tablet form,
[02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:58.200]   along with herbal tea,
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:02.060]   and use this as a way to develop a preference for herbal tea
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:04.580]   because they found that coffee
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:07.280]   was giving them other effects that weren't good for them.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:09.300]   So it works quite well in animals,
[02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:10.840]   and it works quite well in insects,
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:13.040]   and it works quite well in humans.
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.360]   I suppose animals, insects, and humans are all animals
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.380]   at the end of the day, so no surprise there.
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.880]   But it all underscores the sense to which caffeine
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:23.200]   is an absolutely fascinating molecule.
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:26.900]   I mean, it's an ability to offset the sleepiness system,
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:28.480]   if you will, this adenosine system,
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:30.420]   and to control our schedules in that way,
[02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:33.000]   to essentially take a withdrawal against the bank
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.160]   that is adenosine and then pay that back later
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:36.840]   in the form of getting sleepy later
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:38.880]   as opposed to when we want to be alert.
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:42.080]   Its ability to enhance focus, alertness, and mood,
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:44.240]   and if taken after, trying to learn something
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.940]   and remember it to enhance memory especially,
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:51.480]   and its ability to increase VO2 max, increase strength.
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:52.680]   We didn't even talk today about it,
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:55.960]   but I'll just briefly mention that caffeine ingested
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.960]   in the sorts of doses we talked about earlier
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:00.240]   because its effects on the neuromuscular system
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:04.400]   and the calcium system associated with neuromuscular
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:07.780]   exertion and fatigue can increase peak power output
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.320]   and muscle contractibility.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.340]   It's enhancing performance there as well.
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:14.960]   And of course, caffeine does a number of other things
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:17.800]   just generally related to our overall and basal level
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.040]   of mood and alertness,
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:21.920]   not the least of which are these increases in dopamine.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:24.580]   So caffeine is really an incredible molecule.
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.400]   It's affecting all these various neurotransmitter systems,
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:29.000]   but not haphazardly.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.780]   It's increasing dopamine and acetylcholine in the forebrain
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.620]   to increase attention.
[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:34.700]   It's reducing fatigue.
[02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:37.020]   It's improving mental and physical performance
[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:39.200]   for some obvious and some not so obvious reasons.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:41.980]   And what I think is among the more miraculous
[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:43.360]   and powerful effects of caffeine,
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:47.380]   it is a potent, potent, potent reinforcer
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:51.440]   of things, foods, people, and experiences.
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:53.160]   And it's one that you can leverage
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.620]   in any direction that you like
[02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:57.240]   once you understand the way that caffeine
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:59.540]   exerts those reinforcing properties.
[02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:02.400]   So today I've really tried to cover as much as I could
[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:04.240]   about the mechanisms of caffeine action
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:05.240]   in the brain and body,
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:08.240]   as well as tools and schedules and dosages
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:10.240]   in which you can leverage caffeine
[02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:12.640]   in order to meet your physical performance,
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:14.500]   mental performance, and frankly,
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:17.060]   mental health and overall health goals.

[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:55.480]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.760]   And all of those places
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:58.520]   I describe science and science-related tools,
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:20:59.900]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:01.240]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:03.800]   but much of which is distinct from content
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:04.840]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:07.760]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:10.040]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:12.860]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.
[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:14.960]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:17.000]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.080]   for things like sleep, hormone augmentation, and focus.
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:21.360]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:24.500]   discussed on various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:36.400]   and they formulated supplements in the precise ways
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:40.040]   that are discussed as optimal to take for various outcomes
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:41.820]   here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:26.600]   and its many powerful uses.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.960]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:30.760]   thank you for your interest in science.
