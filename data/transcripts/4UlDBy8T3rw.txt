[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.820]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.440]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.200]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.400]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.800]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center

[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.480]   coming up this October 12 through the 14,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.960]   featuring many speakers that I've
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.280]   had on this podcast and more.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280]   Today, our special guest is Antti Ilmenen.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.600]   Antti is principal and global head of the Portfolio
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.000]   Solutions Group at AQR and develops AQR's
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   high-level investment ideas.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.480]   Antti received his PhD from the University of Chicago
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.080]   and is the recipient of many awards,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.520]   including the Graham and Dodd Award, the Harry M. Markowitz
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.920]   Special Distinction Award, and multiple Bernstein-Fabozzi
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.600]   Jacobs-Levy Awards.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.640]   He is the author of two books, "Expected Returns,"
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.520]   and most recently, "Investing Amid Low Expected Returns--
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.840]   Making the Most When Markets Offer the Least."
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.440]   This podcast is a review of his latest book.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.480]   It's a little less than one hour long, but not nearly enough
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.240]   time.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.760]   I could have spent 10 hours talking
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.680]   with Antti about all of the concepts in this book.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.840]   It is quite fascinating, but very easy to read.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.080]   We discussed nominal expected returns of asset classes
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   and investment strategies, real returns, which
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.760]   are before the inflation rate, how an asset class or strategy
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.800]   may have a negative expected real return,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.320]   but still be useful to the portfolio
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.920]   because it smooths the return of the portfolio.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.040]   You may find yourself going back and listening to this podcast
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.680]   two or three times, and every time you do,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.560]   you're going to catch something new.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280]   One more comment before we begin.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.960]   I bring many guests on this podcast
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.400]   who have many different ideas.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.680]   It doesn't necessarily mean you should use everything
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   that you hear, but it does add to your body of knowledge,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240]   and that's important.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.400]   So with no further ado, I am very
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.720]   pleased to have with us Antti Ilmenen.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.720]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.280]   Looking forward to this.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.440]   You've got quite a prestigious career,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.280]   but maybe a lot of our listeners are not as familiar with you
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.040]   because you spent a lot of time in the institutional space.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.200]   So could you tell us a little bit about yourself
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.920]   and go as far back as you like?
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   Sure, I'll try to make it pretty brief.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.360]   So I'm originally Finnish and started my working career
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.600]   as a young portfolio manager in Finnish Central Bank,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.720]   investing the country's reserves.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.080]   And then I caught the lucky break,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.440]   and I met Ken French, who was teaching us in 1989.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.360]   And that basically gave me a, I would say,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.480]   fast track window to come to University of Chicago
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.760]   to do my PhD.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.280]   And that was just a wonderful time for a few years,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.120]   learning a lot.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.360]   And I got both Fama and French as my dissertation advisors,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.080]   got to know my future colleagues at AQR,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.000]   my wife as well.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.880]   So just wonderful.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.160]   Wherever you meet your wife, your life has changed.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.240]   And well, she happens to be German,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.000]   and that's why I am talking from Germany now.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.400]   And so I've always had an international role,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.680]   but German home base then for her.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.840]   Anyway, so then after the PhD,
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.040]   I went to work for Salomon Brothers as a bond strategist
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.800]   and bond researcher for a decade.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   Turned into prop trading,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.080]   and so I was always fixed income oriented,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.320]   converted into macro strategies,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.560]   and was in macro hedge fund, Brevin Howard,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.320]   then seven years, 2004 to '11,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.360]   which was very interesting time.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.960]   But it's a discretionary place,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.560]   and I have got a pretty systematic heart.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.120]   So it was sort of matter of time when I would join AQR.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.440]   Could you explain the difference between systematic
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.200]   and discretionary?
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.040]   Sure.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   So a discretionary investor makes judgmental decisions,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.800]   whereas systematic is basically rules-based.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.040]   You try to, I mean, you use discretion
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.360]   to come up with the rules,
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   but then you really try to stick with them.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.880]   Whereas a discretionary manager basically looks,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.760]   whether it's stock picking or macro environment,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.800]   tries to just look at the specifics in that situation
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.400]   without caring about particular rules.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.640]   So discretionary, I mean, Warren Buffett.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.760]   That would be a good example, yes, yes.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   And then AQR, since 2011,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.080]   and I've been there now 10 years,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.240]   in my natural home, I would say.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.720]   You did your PhD at the University of Chicago,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.960]   and your dissertation advisors were both Gene Fama
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.600]   and Ken French, correct?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.360]   Yes, yeah.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.200]   Source of pride, yes.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   And also I was reading in your book
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.960]   that when Gene Fama won the Nobel Prize,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.040]   you were in Stockholm,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.280]   and you were there when he accepted it.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.320]   I had been advising some Swedish investors in my role,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   and I asked if they could help get the ticket
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.920]   to attend the ceremony.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   And I could, and then could attend some events also
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.760]   with the other professors who were joining Fama,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.280]   and it was just wonderful.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.120]   What's it like to be in a room
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.880]   where somebody gets a Nobel Prize?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.560]   So yeah, you are high up in the balcony,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.680]   and it's very serious,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.160]   serious but warm atmosphere there.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.000]   I think like there are only happy people in the hall.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.960]   But there's also a reception then separately
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.400]   where you meet people a little bit more comfortably
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.240]   than in that big event.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.960]   That must have been a very unique experience to be there.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.400]   Absolutely.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   Okay, in addition to your work, your day job at AQR,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.080]   you have also written a couple of books,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.640]   and the first book you wrote was "Expected Returns."
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.360]   And that was back in 2010, came out 2011,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.680]   so 10 years ago.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.840]   And what was the reasoning for doing that book?
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.880]   Yeah, I think I had already seen earlier
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.040]   when I was a Bond researcher,
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.400]   I had seen that maybe the best thing I can do
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.360]   is to be some kind of bridge
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.720]   between academia and practitioner world,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.400]   sort of describing some relatively complex ideas,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.360]   like yield curve analysis was my first area
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   where I wrote about, and I got, I don't know,
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.680]   I guess I made a name in that niche audience
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.240]   with some writings I did then.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.040]   And I thought that, okay,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.360]   I have broadened my perceptions on markets.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.480]   I had been advising Norway's, this oil fund,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.320]   for several years, and I had really thought
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.720]   about all kinds of asset classes
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.560]   and all kinds of good investing.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.000]   I felt I have read a lot,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.240]   I have got, I think, a good story to tell
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.880]   of the key components of investing
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.240]   and how to think about this important issue
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.360]   of expected returns on pretty much any asset class
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.720]   or strategy that investors consider.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.640]   So it became sort of my passion project for many years
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.720]   and turned out to be basically a 600-page book.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.200]   - And the premise of this book
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.840]   was to look at various asset classes
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   and try to draw from that where expected returns come from.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.600]   I mean, you were looking at the cash markets,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.520]   equity markets, bond markets,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.760]   credit markets, which is corporate bonds,
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   and also you got into risk premia,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.120]   like value, momentum, and so forth.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.480]   So talk a little bit about that,
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.880]   and then right after that, we'll get into,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.560]   so what has changed?
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   - Yeah, so I think when you think of expected returns
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.800]   of any asset or strategy,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.480]   you want to think about theoretical arguments
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.880]   why there should be a premium,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.400]   and it could be risk-based or behavioral.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.760]   You want to think about historical average returns,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.840]   often long-run average return is an anchor you think about,
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.520]   but then you want to think about forward-looking measures,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   so current market conditions.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.400]   It could be starting yields,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.360]   which is often the case,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.440]   or valuations that guide you on current expected returns.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.080]   So I try to give basically multiple perspectives
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.680]   to that expected return question,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.640]   and then draw on both the literature
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.720]   and lots of empirical analysis that I did myself
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.800]   on all of these return sources,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.320]   highlighting the most important ones.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.480]   - Then you call it an update of your book,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.160]   kind of an add-on to that book,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.640]   which is the one that just came out earlier this year
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.360]   called "Investing Amid Low Expected Returns."
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   So obviously your analysis between 2011 or 2010,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.520]   and 2020, 2021, when you wrote this book,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.840]   was that going forward,
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.040]   the returns from asset classes,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.480]   risk premia, style premia perhaps,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.200]   we don't know, we'll get into it in a second,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.840]   but particularly asset classes
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.720]   are going to be lower going forward.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.600]   Was that the premise of what you were trying
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.400]   to put out with the second book?
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   Like you said, first, partly an update.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.960]   I did feel like the world had changed somewhat
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.280]   and there was new research,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.760]   but especially I had this feeling
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.360]   that this question on low expected returns
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.120]   on major investments is almost like a generational challenge
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.320]   that has been underappreciated,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   partly because realized returns have been quite benign.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.560]   So in some sense, a key thesis I have there
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.480]   is that lower and lower bond yields in recent decades,
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.440]   including the last one,
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.280]   have been helping all other assets
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.240]   get to lower starting yields.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.120]   And those low starting yields,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.000]   which you can also think of high valuations,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.360]   they basically promise us low future returns.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.240]   We don't know quite when,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.960]   whether it's going to be fast or slow,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.360]   but that challenge is there.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   But because while the required years were falling,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.720]   that at the same time basically gave,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.480]   richened those assets.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.520]   We got pretty nice realized returns on bonds
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.240]   and on stocks and on anything really,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.720]   all major asset classes during this time.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.880]   And that made me worried
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.800]   that investors don't see the challenge
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.720]   because they look at the rear view mirror
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.640]   of realized returns.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.280]   Back in 1980, the 10-year treasury bond
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.640]   had a yield of about 16%.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.320]   And 20 years later, 2020,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.840]   it was less than 1%.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.240]   So this fall of interest rates
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.280]   from 16 to less than one on a 10-year treasury,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.640]   and also a rapid decline,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.120]   fairly similar, in fact, probably larger on T-bills,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.240]   which is considered the risk-free rate.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.000]   This caused a very large excess return
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.400]   among asset classes, stocks, bonds, real estate,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.720]   over a 40-year period of time.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.840]   And as a baby boomer, I mean, this has been great, right?
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.640]   We have really benefited, but that has ended.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   And now we're back to reality.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.680]   - Yeah, that's a key theme.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.760]   And while I say this is not only bonds,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.720]   it's all asset classes,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.680]   but it emanates from bonds.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.240]   And just to show the parallel there to other asset classes,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.600]   if we take the discount rate for equities,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.960]   like a simple way of thinking
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.480]   of the equity market's discount rate
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   would be to look at the Shiller earnings yield.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.760]   So this is the inverse of the CAPE ratio.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.400]   One can think of that as the discount rate for S&P 500.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.880]   And that was basically 10% 40 years ago,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   and then it came down to 3%.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   And that gave very nice returns as the repricing happened.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.080]   But prospectively, that sort of guarantees us
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.600]   problems for the future.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.960]   And I think a good way of thinking of this situation
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.520]   is that all asset classes,
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.160]   whether we talk of bonds, stocks, or housing,
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.560]   you can think of them as basically priced
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.280]   through estimating expected future cash flows
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.600]   and discounting them by your common discount rate,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.480]   which would be this, let's say, real treasury yield.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.360]   And then some asset-specific premia.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.520]   And when that common discount rate is so low
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.600]   as it became negative real yield,
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.800]   that made everything expensive at the same time.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.000]   We've had this sort of everything bubble, in a sense.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.720]   And one way of thinking of this is that while 40 years ago
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.840]   we were having high expected return but cheap valuations,
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.320]   now we have got low expected returns and high valuations.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.760]   Effectively, we have sort of borrowed returns
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.520]   from the future by pricing all these assets so expensively.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.960]   - Yeah, let's get into that just for a second.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   About 2021, when the stock market went way up unexpectedly
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.440]   but interest rates did come down to, as I said,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.600]   below 1% for the 10-year treasury.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.520]   That, in effect, with real estate and with equity
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   and with bonds, we were borrowing returns from the future.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.920]   So when people think of the cushy returns
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.800]   that they have been getting in recent years,
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.360]   it's not something that, in some way,
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.200]   you should certainly expect to be repeated.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   But in some sense, you should expect that in the future
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.680]   you will get something less
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.880]   because those higher prices you get for your assets
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.240]   brought the starting yields lower.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.160]   And the starting yields on any investment,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.080]   they are a heavy anchor.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.920]   They do matter for those expected returns
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.120]   that's most obvious for bonds.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.640]   But this is, again, it's very true also
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.080]   for those other asset classes, equities, housing, et cetera.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.160]   And so I do not know whether the low expected returns
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.600]   will materialize through what I call the slow pain
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.080]   of staying in this world of high valuations
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.600]   and low starting yields
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.680]   where we just clip ever smaller coupons and dividends,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.200]   friends, or whether we get a repricing,
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.520]   which now has happened in 2022, that I call the fast pain.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.280]   So I said sort of pretty, pretty unhappily told
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.600]   that we can sort of expect that it's gonna be
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.320]   either a slow pain or fast pain
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.160]   or some combination of those two.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.000]   It turns out that we got quite a bit of fast pain this year,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.280]   but not enough, it turns out,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.040]   that it would have solved the problem.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.480]   We have seen assets cheap and somewhat,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.240]   but not nearly enough to get them back
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.040]   to sort of long-run average levels.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.080]   We had this sell-off in the equity market
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   and in the fixed income market this year, 2022,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.520]   but now we've had a rebound of equity prices
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.920]   and interest rates have fallen,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.240]   not nearly as low as what they were in 2021,
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.280]   but they have come back.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.240]   But that's not enough, you don't think.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.200]   You think that it's gonna go more,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.720]   even though we've had this fast correction,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.240]   get some asset prices closer
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.280]   to perhaps where they should be,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.040]   that probably we still have more to go.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.600]   And the question is, is it going to be
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.040]   ripping the Band-Aid off
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.120]   and getting it all done all at once,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.840]   or is it just gonna be sort of a slow bleeding?
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.760]   Yeah, basically the starting yields,
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.120]   if you think of government bonds, real yields,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.000]   they were sort of minus 1%
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.840]   when they were very low last year,
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   and they got to near zero now.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.160]   And so there's been about 1% move on that front.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.360]   For equities, I would say that the change
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.320]   has been less than that, maybe half a percent.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   And both of them are a couple of percentage points away
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.040]   from long-run historical averages, what you could get.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.080]   So if we get to those averages,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.000]   there would be much more to happen,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.600]   but maybe we don't get there.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.880]   So my short-term view,
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.160]   and this is getting to the speculative punditry,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.600]   is that the inflation problem is serious enough.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.080]   And that's gonna basically force
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.840]   more monetary policy tightening than markets discount now.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.120]   And that, I think, maybe the young generation of investors
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.760]   don't really understand what it means
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.600]   when Fed is tightening seriously,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.200]   because that has not happened often
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.560]   and not really in their investment lifetime.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   But I think some pain will be needed for asset owners
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   before this inflation genie is taken care of.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.160]   - I wanna talk about the risk-free rate,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.080]   which is called the Treasury Bill,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.920]   which all of these valuation models and equations
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.600]   stem from what is the risk-free rate, T-bills.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   And historically, globally, not just the U.S.,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.160]   but globally, the T-bill rate
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.840]   has basically been the inflation rate.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.000]   Now, that hasn't been true in the United States.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.400]   Over the last several years,
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.120]   the T-bill rate was actually a little higher
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.160]   as we came up, as inflation dropped,
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.000]   and then it took a while
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.400]   for interest rates to come back down.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   But now, going forward over the next 40 years, let's say,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.320]   it seems reasonable to assume
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   that the risk-free rate and the inflation rate will be close.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   Do you agree with that?
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.680]   - Yeah, yeah, and so it is.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.440]   So one maybe detail is that one can debate
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.600]   whether the risk-free rate that's relevant
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.920]   for long-run investors is the T-bill rate
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.240]   or the long-term bond rate.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.880]   And there's some term premium between those.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.000]   But all of these came to very low levels.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.520]   And I would say that, roughly speaking,
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.360]   short-term, right now, short-term cash, long-term bonds,
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.920]   expected 10-year inflation,
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.920]   they are sort of similar level,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.160]   near, a little under 3% or so.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.760]   - So let's then move to equities.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.360]   So equities have an expected real risk premium
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.800]   over the risk-free rate.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   Historically, in the U.S.,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.520]   it's been higher than it has globally.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.160]   Globally, it's been about 5%,
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.800]   but in the U.S., it's been higher, over 6%.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.600]   This is compounded.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.720]   Can we reasonably expect globally
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.680]   that it should continue to be 5%?
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.200]   - Yeah, that's probably optimistic.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.320]   I think it is likely that the equity risk premium
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.640]   will be thinner.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.040]   So I think total expected real returns on equities,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.640]   ballpark of 4%, probably a little less than that.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.400]   In the U.S., a little above that.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.160]   Outside the U.S., and then you can add
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.720]   the expected inflation on top of that
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.240]   to get the total return estimate.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   - Fair enough.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   I want to get into the components of the real return 4%.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.600]   That can be broken down to a real growth rate
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   of earnings per share, and then dividends.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.680]   Ko, you break that down,
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.760]   and then for coming up with your number.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.600]   - Sure.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.960]   So I think a good way of thinking of,
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.520]   if we focus on equities,
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.360]   is this idea of just dividend discount model
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   where you are earning some real yield and real growth,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.960]   and then maybe inflation, if we think of that.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.280]   But let's just focus on real yield, real growth.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.240]   And it could be both, by the way, ballpark 2% each.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.080]   And then there's a question
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.120]   whether there's a change in valuations.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.080]   So when you look at the realized returns,
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.840]   like last decade had much higher returns
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.920]   because the valuations basically doubled.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.760]   Shiller PE went from 20 to 40.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.200]   So realized returns were much more.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.840]   But sort of roughly 4% expected return,
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.640]   half from real compound growth
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.240]   and half from starting yield.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.560]   And you can think of dividend yield
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.640]   and a little bit from net buybacks.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.440]   Those are the components.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   - How does that all work into a global GDP growth?
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.360]   - Equity market returns.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.960]   So they are higher than what you get on a GDP growth,
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.040]   which has been typically 2 to 2.5% or something like that,
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.680]   partly because equity is sort of a levered exposure
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.040]   to economic growth.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.960]   There's that nice intuition there.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.000]   But that doesn't mean that there's a tight correlation
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.200]   between economic GDP growth and equity returns.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.040]   It turns out that there's almost zero correlation.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.560]   So this is one of these things I highlight in the book
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.080]   that when you look at these numbers in the US over time,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.960]   or you compare across countries,
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.160]   you find very modest relations
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   between GDP growth and equity returns,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.360]   even though we intuitively think that equities
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.320]   are sort of participation in the real economy.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.040]   - And I read that.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.520]   And I understand on a country by country basis,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.720]   you can't say GDP growth is this,
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.800]   therefore earnings per share growth is that,
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.560]   therefore you take some multiple,
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.200]   and therefore this is what the price
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.320]   of the stock market should be.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.040]   On a country by country basis, I understand that.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.320]   But globally, looking at global GDP growth,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.640]   isn't it more highly correlated,
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.320]   the global equity market to global GDP growth?
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.760]   - Contemporaneously, there's almost nothing.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.160]   But equity markets tend to predict next year's growth.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.640]   So that way you do get something.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.080]   And I think it is true.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.800]   But certainly when equity markets
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.200]   are predicting next year recession,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.160]   then you have got low returns.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.240]   So yeah, I think that correlation becomes
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.600]   when you take, not looking at monthly returns,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.240]   but you look at, let's say, annual returns,
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.880]   and in a forward looking sense,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.800]   you do find some decent relation.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so the intuition, I think, is right,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.680]   that equity returns are both somehow participation
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.240]   in global growth, and they are vulnerable
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.120]   to any hiccups or something more serious
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.680]   to that global growth.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.000]   And that's the big risk then in equity markets.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.360]   - So the real expected return of equity
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   using the simple model of a 2% dividend yield or earning,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.040]   dividend yield, real, and 2% real growth comes out to 4%,
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.640]   and then you add on to that your inflation number,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.120]   and now you come up with,
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.240]   well, if you're gonna use the Fed's inflation number of 2%,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.600]   then you're at about a 6% nominal long-term
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.840]   expected return for equity.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.040]   This a reasonable number to plan for?
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.760]   - Good numbers, yeah.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.200]   I think it's a good point estimate.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.240]   But then we have to sort of recognize
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.200]   that we can debate each of those 2% numbers however much.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.960]   And so fair sort of humility
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.640]   or sense of uncertainty around them,
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.960]   but as point estimates, that's what I would use.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.880]   - So that's one side of the equation, right?
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.280]   We're talking about a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.320]   a 60% equity, 40% fixed income as an example.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.680]   Now we've got to go to the fixed income side.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.480]   So we have an expected long-term return
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.560]   on equities of 6%, nominally, 4% real.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.160]   Now we go to the fixed income side,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.000]   and we've got choices there
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.120]   between treasury bonds and corporate bonds.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.640]   So let's start out with treasury bonds,
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.440]   intermediate-term treasury bonds.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.760]   There has been a premium paid
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.520]   for going out on the yield curve to the 10-year mark
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.640]   where you've picked up more than just the inflation rate.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.200]   And we have agreed that T-bills in the U.S.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.440]   have yielded a little bit more than inflation,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.800]   but let's say going forward
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.600]   that T-bills are gonna give us inflation.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.480]   So now inflation plus something for treasury bonds,
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.600]   for longer-term, say, 10-year treasuries.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.240]   I mean, historically, what's it been,
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.160]   and what do you think it might be going forward?
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.320]   - Yeah, well, the realized return has been quite benign
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.440]   because, again, we got these windfall gains
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.000]   when bond yields were falling,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.200]   and that is probably not fair to think.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.040]   In a forward-looking sense,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.800]   what we should expect to get over cash
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.280]   has been becoming, in some sense, stingier,
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   and the intuition is that government bonds
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.160]   used to have a extra term premium,
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.800]   partly because of the high inflation uncertainty,
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.520]   sort of inflation risk premium,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.800]   and that probably was beat down to near zero
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.240]   in the stable inflation decades after 2000.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.760]   And then government bonds further turned
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.240]   into a safe haven asset
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.800]   when stock-bond correlation turned negative.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.680]   So simple capital asset pricing model intuition says
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.400]   that if you have got a negative beta investment,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.440]   which basically really smooths equity returns,
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.480]   then that could even justify a negative premium,
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.560]   and I think that has helped government bonds
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.280]   become more expensive, and in a forward-looking sense,
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.240]   then we really may have even justified a negative premium.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.640]   And again, realized returns turned out to be very good
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.480]   because of the surprisingly benign picture
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.040]   on both falling inflation expectations
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.720]   and falling real yields.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.960]   Looking ahead, I think there will be
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.880]   some mildly positive term premium,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.880]   but less than the over 1% that people were earning.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.320]   So I would expect something half to 1%,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   maybe extra over cash.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   So roughly that amount of real return
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.600]   on intermediate and 10-year bonds.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.080]   - That's very interesting that it's come down.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.040]   What about the Fed's balance sheet
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.520]   and the Fed letting these bonds roll off,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.320]   and so there's gonna be more supply out there.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.640]   I mean, wouldn't that have an effect
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.720]   of pushing up the yield, the real yield?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.360]   - Yeah, so besides the inflation risk premium,
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.240]   safe haven premium, we said supply-demand factors
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   are the next thing, and that clearly was helpful
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.480]   during the time of quantitative easing,
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.120]   and now it's gonna give some headwinds
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.280]   during quantitative tightening.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.400]   That's why I chose to talk about 10 years
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.720]   where I sort of hope these things don't play out anymore.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.760]   The quantitative tightening story is hopefully there
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.920]   for the next couple of years,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.000]   and then that issue is over.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.080]   - So we're looking at somewhere between a half a percent
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.360]   to 1%, perhaps, over the risk-free rate or over T-bills.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.680]   - Yeah, yeah. - Realistically.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.080]   I mean, you're gonna get paid something
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.000]   for taking turns. - Exactly.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.360]   - Not as much as it was.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.160]   - Yes, and very short-term, there is this question,
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.840]   what happens with inflation,
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.120]   and if Fed has to be more aggressive because of that,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.000]   and that may tell a more bearish story
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.120]   for the next couple of years.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.200]   - So let's move on, then, to another premia
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.000]   in the fixed-income market, and this is credit risk.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.800]   Instead of being in treasuries,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.160]   we're going to be in intermediate-term corporate bonds
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.880]   or mortgages or high-yield
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.920]   versus investment-grade corporate bonds.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.600]   We're gonna take credit risk,
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.760]   and here I found interesting in your book
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   because you changed your mind on this.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.680]   You were kind of negative
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   on investment-grade corporate bonds,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.400]   but you seem to have changed your mind here in this book.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.080]   So talk about credit risk,
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.880]   and then talk about what caused you to change your mind.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.360]   - Sure, sure.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.320]   Well, first, so I would say empirical evidence
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.360]   that says that you do earn some of the credit spread,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.280]   but you don't tend to earn all of it.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.120]   It's, roughly speaking, historically,
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.800]   you've earned about half of the spread,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.400]   and we may return to that a little later.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.560]   But then there's a question like,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.800]   are credits worth including?
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.040]   They have an odd blend
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.200]   between government bonds and equities,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.840]   and it might be that they are
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.200]   sort of a superfluous asset there,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.880]   and I was leaning towards this idea in my first book
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.160]   that maybe you really don't need them,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.600]   and in the second book, I was leaning the other way.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.400]   Well, I'm sort of notoriously two-handed economist
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.520]   that I don't have very black-and-white views,
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.360]   but so certainly, I did lean more positive,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.160]   and the arguments why I leaned more positive on credits
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.280]   were partly just from having a strong decade,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.360]   like after 2010, we had just seen
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.920]   a relatively bad decade for credits,
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.000]   and now we saw a strong decade,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.240]   so that more importantly,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.600]   I looked at some historical research of many decades back,
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.960]   which was telling a more positive story
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.040]   on credit performance and its sort of extra benefit
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.680]   you get beyond government bonds and equities.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   However, I actually, I've been called on this topic
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.200]   many times, and people are saying
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.000]   that you really shouldn't trust too much
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.040]   the data from 1930s to 1960s in credit markets.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.760]   The data just sucks so badly
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.880]   that that evidence is relatively weak,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.040]   and then arguably, the last decade evidence, again,
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.880]   should be discounted because Fed obviously had a big role
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.000]   in pushing also credit asset prices higher
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.560]   during that period.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.200]   So I would still lean mildly more positively,
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.840]   but you hear very weak views.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.200]   - But you do, you are, or you were positive
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.840]   in your view of double B-rated bonds,
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.560]   so-called fallen angels, and I'd like to hear this
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.480]   if you're still positive on that,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.760]   and the reason I say that is because individual investors
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.440]   sometimes take a position in a vanguard
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.720]   high-yield corporate bond fund.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.040]   Now, I don't own this fund, so I'm not touting it.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.960]   I do talk about it in some of my books
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.360]   for the exact reason that you've talked about it
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.480]   in your books, but this double B-rated area
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.680]   where the fallen angels are does tend to seem
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.520]   to have an extra kick to it.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.480]   So you talk about that, and you think if that,
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.760]   does that have any benefit potentially to a portfolio?
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.640]   - Yes, I think so.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.800]   I mean, it is, it's a micro story,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.600]   but it is, in credit markets, it is the best pocket,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.560]   and the intuition, so fallen angels now refers
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.560]   to bonds that are downgraded from investment grade
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.240]   to speculative grade, so typically triple B to double B,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.960]   and many institutions have got rules
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.720]   that they have to sell bonds during the next month
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.480]   to stick with their mandates,
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.640]   and there is effectively a fire sales,
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.520]   and I already wrote about it in my first book,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.520]   and I basically checked the evidence
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.560]   for the second book, is the effect still there,
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.520]   and it is still there through 2010,
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.720]   so it has been very costly for investors
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.360]   to sell those fallen angels in this fire sales.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.120]   Indeed, if you look at the long run performance,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.640]   how much of the overall credit spread
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.840]   investment grade investors earned
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.360]   in excess return over treasury?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   It's ballpark is about half,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.160]   and there's not much default loss that happens there,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.600]   so there are some technical effects,
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.680]   and this is the most important technical effect.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.200]   Even broadly speaking, we are eating up a meaningful part
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.320]   of this extra credit spread.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.480]   Investors lose a meaningful part
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.640]   of the average credit spread
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.720]   by participating in that fire sales,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.440]   so by selling those fallen angels within the first month.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   - You're talking about investment grade credit spread
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.920]   by selling the fallen angels,
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.520]   they lose a lot of total credit spread.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.840]   - Yes, those bonds that are downgraded,
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.600]   they lose a lot of value in that next month.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.880]   If you even would wait six months,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.600]   that would help meaningfully,
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.160]   but ideally just try to stick with those,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.440]   because they have got as good performance historically
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.880]   as any other credit investments.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.280]   - Under liquid asset class premia, you do list commodities,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.280]   and there you talk not only about individual commodities,
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.760]   but about commodity strategies,
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.320]   so could you go into commodities?
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.560]   - Sure.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.560]   Many investors think that there is no reward
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.160]   for commodity investing,
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.800]   and it turns out that that's true in the long run
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.440]   if you think of a single,
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.480]   especially single spot commodity,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.520]   but if you think of a diversified portfolio
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.200]   of commodity futures,
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.280]   you actually have earned something like 3%,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.440]   and a little bit of that comes from the futures part,
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.400]   the role effect in the long run historically,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.920]   but the bigger part is so-called diversification return.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.160]   This is something that Farmer and Booth
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.880]   already discussed with equities in early '90s,
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.080]   and it's a very small effect in equities,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.800]   but basically with commodities,
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.240]   it's important and worth 3%.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.640]   The intuition is that a single commodity is very volatile,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.000]   often 30% or more volatility,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.200]   and that gives a volatility drag to the compound return.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.880]   It takes down the compound return geometric mean,
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.000]   but those individual commodities
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.080]   are also very lowly correlated with each other,
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.680]   so you can diversify across them in very simple ways,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.120]   and you can reduce portfolio volatility
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.600]   and reduce that volatility drag,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.800]   and that gets the average return
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.960]   from typical single commodity zero over cash
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.280]   to about 3% over cash,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.840]   just thanks to this effect
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.040]   that you are reducing portfolio volatility.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.120]   - I'm gonna push back a little bit here.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:36.960]   - Please.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.240]   - That is a trading strategy.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   That's not a premia on a asset class, correct?
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.840]   As you said, if you just bought the asset class
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.800]   and held it, buy and hold,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   basically, you get maybe the inflation rate,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.000]   but what you're talking about is a--
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.840]   - No, no.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   - Okay, go ahead.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.880]   - You really get the 3% by naive diversification.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.720]   It's true that you have to buy,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.560]   I mean, in theory, you might do it with spot commodities,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.960]   by the way, but nobody could do that
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.040]   because you don't wanna buy their pork bellies.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.000]   - No, I understand.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.840]   You're doing one-month futures or something.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.920]   - Yeah, but it is really the only thing you are doing here.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.480]   You are rolling every month or quarter something.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.040]   So it is none of the things that you,
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.280]   it is not momentum strategy, roll strategy.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.520]   This part, that will be extra.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.400]   This is saying that just by reducing portfolios volatility
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   and the volatility drag, you are generating positive return.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.640]   It's a complicated thing.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.040]   - I understand, but it's not a market-weighted
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.880]   or capitalization-weighted strategy at all.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.240]   It is basically an equal-weighted strategy.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.720]   So you have to come up with your equal-weighted index
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.520]   that you're going to target.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.880]   And then every month, you have to trade the portfolio
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.080]   to get it back to the equal weight.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.120]   So, I mean, it's an active strategy.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.920]   - It is, but it can be a very simple strategy.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.360]   - That means you gotta pay somebody to do this.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.720]   I mean, somebody, some active manager,
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.960]   some asset manager.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.400]   So, yeah, it's a futures trading strategy.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.800]   Somebody will have to do that.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.440]   It can be at a very low cost,
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.720]   or you can try to add some of those,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   some extras carry and momentum type of strategies
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.760]   on top of that.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.800]   But if you want to keep it simple,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   it is very modest, modest cost.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.920]   But it's true that it's not total buy and hold
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.120]   when you use futures.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.240]   - Let's talk about gold for a second.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.360]   You did talk about gold and your view on that was...
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.320]   - Zero real return in the long run.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.640]   It is low compared to many other assets,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.160]   but it makes sense mechanically
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.520]   because you are not earning any coupons or dividends.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.120]   And logically, it sort of makes sense
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.920]   because gold has been a sort of safe haven or hedge,
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.920]   an admittedly imperfect one,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.520]   but against a variety of ills.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.120]   It has tended to do relatively well,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.640]   both in rising inflation scenarios
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.360]   or in equity market drawdowns.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.920]   Not very reliably, for example,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   this year we had both of those and gold hasn't shown.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.400]   - Interesting.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.560]   Okay, so those are the asset classes,
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.240]   cash, equities, treasury bonds, corporate bonds,
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.640]   including fallen angel, high yield bonds and commodities.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.880]   So those are the asset classes in the risk premium.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.520]   Now let's get into the second part of your book,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.080]   style premium, things like value investing,
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.720]   momentum investing, quality investing,
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.000]   and then you have carry.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.080]   So there are some styles where I think
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.760]   the consensus of researchers has converged
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.440]   to saying that there is a long run premium,
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.880]   which looks pretty much empirically
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.800]   as good as equity premium.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.840]   - This is long, short, or just long only?
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.680]   - And this can be both.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   Any of these strategies can be applied
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.360]   as long only portfolios where you tilt a little more
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.200]   and you already favor last year's winners in momentum,
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.160]   favor more boring, good quality or low beta stocks
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.080]   in defensive or high dividend yield stocks in carry.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.840]   Or you can do a long, short strategy in all of these cases.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.200]   And you could also apply them outside stock selection,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.560]   do this, use this in country allocation.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.960]   And if you do this, so both of these are useful.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.160]   The latter approach, long, short, is more aggressive.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.520]   It will give wonderful diversification benefits
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.200]   because then you have got many different return sources,
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.160]   but it has got problems because they are unconventional
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.600]   and they will challenge investor patients
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   much more than equities if you have a bad window
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.400]   for these strategies.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   - I think that most individual investors,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.920]   if they're going to do style premium factor investing,
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.120]   it's going to be long only.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.920]   And it's going to be in one fund.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.720]   So it's a multi-factor fund.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.640]   How do you feel about multi-factor?
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.440]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.080]   I clearly like it because, again, I like diversification.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.120]   And many of these styles relative to each other
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.520]   are very lowly correlated.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.040]   Even value and momentum as active tilts
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.880]   are negatively correlated.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.520]   And sometimes some others.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.880]   But you get really nice benefits
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.600]   when you combine these strategies.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.320]   So I think anybody who chooses to use only single one style
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.240]   has to have a really strong conviction
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.200]   that this is the one thing I believe in
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.560]   as opposed to the other ones.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.000]   Because, again, there are these three, four, five things
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.920]   which all seem like quite good complements
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.400]   to each other as well.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.240]   - Do you find that there's a higher value premium
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.040]   in small cap rather than large cap?
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.120]   - I think for many of these premia,
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.280]   we find that on paper, small segment
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.560]   is a better fishing pond, which is a higher premium there.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.480]   And again, that's on paper.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.120]   And it could be that after trading costs,
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.600]   much of that goes away.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.840]   So in general, I think we tend to find
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.520]   as good opportunities after costs
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.840]   in large cap and small cap segments.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.920]   So I don't have a strong view on this
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.760]   as I know many other people do.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.040]   - The last item that you put in style premia
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   is called carry, where carry is a long, short strategy.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.880]   And the simplest way of describing it
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.960]   is what looks expensive, you sell,
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.200]   and what looks cheap, you buy.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   So you're selling very low-yielding country bonds
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.720]   and you're buying very high-yielding country bonds.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.480]   Is that a fair assessment of carry?
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.680]   - Well, I think when you said cheap and expensive,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.600]   I would call that a value strategy.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.520]   Whereas for carry, I would just call it
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.480]   high-yielding and low-yielding.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.280]   And in some cases, carry and value sort of go hand-in-hand.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.080]   And like dividend yield strategies
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.120]   and book-to-price strategies are highly correlated.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.560]   But they can be, so I would say in equities,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.920]   the carry strategy would be using dividend yield
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.160]   or a broader payout yield metric
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.440]   to favor certain stocks over others.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.000]   But then if you think of some other asset contexts,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.840]   the most famous carry strategy perhaps is currency carry.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.240]   And then basically, currency carry strategy
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.000]   of favoring high-yielding currencies
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.320]   is very different than currency value strategy,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.040]   where you look for currencies that look cheap
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.080]   based on purchasing power parity.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.760]   - It's strictly a yield concept,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.080]   buy the high yield, sell the low yield.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:48.920]   - Yes.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.720]   - And it could be across any asset class.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.400]   So this is what carry means.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.120]   Okay, but it is long/short.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.240]   I mean, it's not just long only.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.560]   - Yes, can be both again.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.280]   You can do long only favoring high dividend yielders.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   It's not a great strategy,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.160]   but it's a mildly positive share price strategy.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   - The next area is what's called illiquidity premia.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.440]   And here can be divided up into the three major categories,
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.160]   which is real estate, private equity,
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.600]   and then private loans or private credit.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   Let's start out with real estate.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.360]   A lot of people just own a home,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.080]   or they have rental property,
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   or they buy a REIT fund.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:29.920]   - Sure.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.800]   Well, first, people may extrapolate too much
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.520]   when you look at real estate prices in recent decades.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.600]   I think with these illiquid assets,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.320]   it's also helpful to take this dividend discount model idea
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.200]   that you ask what's the expected return
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.320]   through expected yield, expected real growth,
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.720]   and maybe expected change in valuation.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.000]   Empirical evidence suggests that with real estate,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.640]   you pretty much get the yield.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.440]   So you shouldn't expect changing valuations.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.000]   And the real growth,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.840]   you can debate whether it's been positive or negative
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.680]   in the long run.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.000]   And I think zero is a very reasonable number.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.160]   So I would say basically,
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   think that you are going to earn your yield.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.200]   And the relevant yield for real estate
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.160]   is basically something like free cash flow yield.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.080]   So if you are thinking of a bigger number,
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.560]   like rent to price ratio, rental yield,
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.640]   that's sort of too high
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.880]   because you have to subtract expenses,
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.800]   which is often one third of that.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.400]   So my reading is if there's 4% rental yield nowadays,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.840]   then you get something like 2.5% expected real return.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.480]   More than bonds, but less than equities.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.320]   And the intuition is that you don't get any real growth.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.880]   - And give me your views on REITs.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.800]   - Sure.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.920]   Lots of thinking about illiquidity premium,
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.240]   because like I sometimes say,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.560]   illiquidity premium are overrated.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.640]   And one intuition just is that
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.360]   people really like the smoothing feature,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.680]   that it's sort of painful to lock your money for a long time,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.960]   but it's really nice to get the lack of mark to market.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.280]   And those two features could offset each other.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.520]   And so one place where you can measure
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.240]   illiquidity premium arguably pretty well
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.520]   is in the real estate,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.360]   where you compare listed REITs to direct real estate,
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.040]   which is much less liquid.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.000]   And it turns out that
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.760]   when you look at this pretty long history,
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.120]   we've got 45 years of data in the US,
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.560]   we find that actually
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.040]   there's been inverse illiquidity premium.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.160]   REITs have outperformed.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.200]   And then the counter argument will be that
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.520]   they are not really comparable,
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.480]   that REITs have got lots of beta and leverage.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.000]   And it's true that when researchers have adjusted
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.400]   for those beta and leverage differences,
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.520]   you get some of that negative illiquidity premium away,
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.280]   but you never get a positive illiquidity premium
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.960]   in any analysis that I've seen.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.560]   So again, the evidence is very modest
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.920]   on the idea that there are great illiquidity premium
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.320]   in private assets.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.480]   - That's very interesting.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.320]   And the other two,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.840]   which I don't really want to spend that much time on
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.720]   is private equity and private credit.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.040]   Most individual investors
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.440]   really don't have access to good private equity.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.400]   - They are recently,
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.360]   they are sort of institutional favorites,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.800]   but I think that institutions
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.600]   tend to be over-optimistic on them.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.320]   And partly they really like the smoothing feature,
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.800]   but also I think they have got higher expectations.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   So I think because of this growing investor interest
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.160]   in that space,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.720]   I think even if there was an extra return,
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.360]   I think much of that has been beat down.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.520]   And again, another logic is that the smoothing
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.560]   has taken it down.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.880]   So I think it's a pretty reasonable thing to think that
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.360]   you get pretty similar returns from private equity
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.600]   as public equity after all fees,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.640]   which are much higher in private equity.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.320]   And likewise, private credit versus public credit,
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.400]   net returns could be very similar on both sides.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.600]   So I don't think investors are missing much
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.320]   by not having access to this,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.160]   but there are lots of dream sellers out there
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.680]   who tell a different story.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.280]   - Well, let's talk about the active managers and alpha,
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.160]   which is the fourth category that you have.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   And there we've got managers that are trying to pick stocks,
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.560]   not systematic, but trying to pick stocks.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.560]   And talk about alpha, alpha decay,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.360]   should investors be seeking alpha?
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.320]   - Yeah, I mean, that's the holy grail,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.480]   which is so lovely, but so elusive.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.280]   And I think it's good to be realistic about it
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.080]   and expect very little on that.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.280]   Obviously there's a lot of marketing for it.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.000]   And there is, to be clear,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.400]   there is some evidence, mutual fund evidence
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.080]   is not good on managers generally
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.400]   providing net positive alpha.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.440]   But institutional managers, hedge funds, private equity
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.160]   may have collectively outperformed.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.760]   But that's again, it has come down.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.080]   You mentioned this concept of alpha decay,
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.520]   that evidence from more recent data is questioning
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.800]   even that whether there has been net outperformance.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.080]   Obviously some managers will outperform
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.800]   and then you can question whether it's been luck
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.760]   or skill and so on.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.040]   And this is one of these eternal debates.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   And yet it is interesting that so many investors
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.320]   still like to do either own active investing
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.360]   or traditional active managers and pay decent fees.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.680]   And that is somehow telling of the both marketing success
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.720]   and overconfidence that we have.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.360]   - So that's the technical side of your book,
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.120]   but then you have a whole different side of the book.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:42.320]   It had to do with behavior and being patient
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.840]   and sustaining a conviction.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.040]   And so could you talk about why you wrote this side
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.480]   of the book and the main points
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.880]   on what you were trying to get across?
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.600]   - Yeah, I think if I have to pick one sort of bad habit
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.240]   from investors, it tends to be related to impatience.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.920]   And you can also think the flip side of that
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.040]   can be chasing last three to five year returns
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.520]   and capitulating after three to five bad years.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.040]   But basically statistical evidence
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.120]   after a few years is very weak.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.280]   It could be that if somebody has got very good
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.240]   or very bad performance,
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.560]   it is more likely to be random luck
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.960]   than really sign of some wonderful skill.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.160]   And so investors chasing those returns
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.520]   and being impatient after bad returns
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.960]   is a very costly tendency.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.520]   And I try to then highlight the more specific
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.560]   what could be the costs.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.800]   They include things like you may miss out
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.120]   on long run returns.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.000]   Could be equity premium, could be any of these other premia
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.760]   where you get a disappointing draw
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.600]   and you leave that strategy.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.680]   You will miss out on the long run premium.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.320]   - Opportunity cost?
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.160]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.320]   So that's opportunity cost indeed.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.760]   And then there's the actual cost
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.640]   of basically trading out of those positions
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.080]   and all kinds of friction from related trading.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.160]   And then to the extent that there is something
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.400]   like three to five year mean reversion
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.320]   and to the extent that investors tend to chase returns
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.520]   just like at those frequencies,
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   then that is particularly costly.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.200]   So Cliff Asness, my boss has sometimes said
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.720]   that there is this unfortunate tendency of investors
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.960]   to act like momentum investors at the reversal horizons.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.800]   So chasing three year returns,
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.040]   when you look at historical market data,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.400]   there's a greater tendency to see mean reversion
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.320]   over three year horizons.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.200]   So all of those possible costs are there.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.840]   And so my goal then is to highlight the costs
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:42.600]   and then discuss ways if investors buy the idea
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.240]   that patience is good, it's a virtue,
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.440]   it will give better long run results,
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.960]   what kind of strategies you can use
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.480]   to make yourself more patient,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.120]   cultivate personal or organizational patience.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.560]   - So discipline tools is what you talked about.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   Education, review broadly and infrequently.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.000]   Make a bigger organizational commitment.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.960]   And I put in parentheses, the Bogleheads.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.640]   In other words, just keep going to the Boglehead site
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.720]   to remind yourself.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.320]   Move slowly into new ideas.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.160]   Avoid complexity.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.880]   And a few others as well.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.520]   And I think anything that enhances patience
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.360]   tends to be good.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.080]   So equities are forgiven a bad decade
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.920]   or at least a bad few years.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.360]   Nothing else will stay in investor portfolios
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.240]   with such a long disappointing period.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.720]   So the conviction that investors have
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.200]   because of the evidence and theories
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.720]   on equity premia are helpful.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.960]   And I think just the mere conventionality.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.080]   People are so used to it.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.080]   So that is great.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.480]   I would, you know, I'm cautious about illiquids,
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.520]   but I would say smoothing makes people more patient.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.560]   With styles, diversification can help.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.840]   But in general, I confess that with the things
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.160]   that I love the most, some of the style premia,
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.120]   the unconventionality makes challenging
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.960]   from patient's perspective.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.520]   - You talked about just doing simple rebalancing
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.840]   versus doing tactical market timing.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.600]   Could you just touch on that?
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.920]   Well, so rebalancing really tries to stick
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.800]   with some long run targets.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.560]   So market timing, especially contrarian timing,
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.280]   I sometimes say is a proactively contrarian strategy.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.320]   If markets fall and become cheap,
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.320]   you wanna buy more than normally.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.080]   Whereas with rebalancing, you are sort of
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.440]   defensively contrarian.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.840]   You just wanna get back to your target weights.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.000]   So I think the key idea with rebalancing
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.920]   is that you've got some idea
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.240]   of what's a good long run portfolio for you,
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.560]   asset class weights or risk targets,
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.280]   and you wanna basically stick relatively near to those
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.720]   and you rebalance back towards those targets.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.760]   And that's good for keeping the risk level that you like
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.000]   and maintaining diversification.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.760]   And then there might be some extra return enhancement
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.440]   that comes either from the kind of thing
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   I mentioned earlier there with commodities,
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.720]   is reducing portfolio volatility
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   that can help to some extent,
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.600]   but especially if there are some mean reversion patterns
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.760]   that you could catch that would be icing on the cake.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.560]   - In your last chapter, one of the last chapters, 17,
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.680]   you talked about good and bad habits of investors
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.400]   and the bad habits are selling losers and buying the winners,
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:34.280]   over extrapolation, meaning just too much complexity.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.000]   I call it mood trading where,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.600]   hey, I think this is good, let's buy this.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.320]   Or I think this is bad, let's buy that.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.000]   Overconfidence in your ability.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.520]   And these are the bad habits that people have.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.560]   Good habits is a discipline
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.800]   and be very thoughtful about your asset allocation decision.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.880]   And don't take too much or too little risk
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.800]   in various asset classes.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.320]   And invest strategically and keep your costs down.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.560]   Do you have any more you'd like to add
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.120]   to the good and bad habits?
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.240]   - That is the key list.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.760]   And again, the first one I said is related is impatience.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.480]   So sort of multi-year return chasing,
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.640]   I sometimes call the premier bad habit.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.480]   And maybe overconfidence,
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.240]   I think the important implication of that is over trading.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.320]   And that of course has been historically quite costly.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.280]   And maybe I do mention something beyond this.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.960]   I tell a few times in the book,
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.800]   okay, I'm envious towards various,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.440]   I don't know, discretionary investors and other,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.200]   well, active managers who have got great stories,
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.920]   whether it's a stock picker or macro.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.760]   And I think when I'm a systematic investor
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.440]   and I've got this factor investing diversification,
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   they don't lend themselves well to great stories.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.240]   So then I say that, at some point I say that,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.960]   actually, it could be that stories are really bad
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.680]   but they cater to some biases that we have.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.360]   Like they cater certainly to our hindsight bias.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.320]   They make future seem more predictable than it is.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.960]   And another concept is so-called base rate neglect.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.440]   So we think too much of the salient cases
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.160]   rather than apply probabilistic thinking.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.480]   So really, I think stories,
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.600]   while they are humanly so important,
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.840]   they also can be reasons for some bad investment practices.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.160]   And so, I'm trying to defend this kind of
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.880]   quanti-statistically-oriented mindset
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.800]   and claim that there are some advantages.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.640]   - Let's hold on.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.080]   I mean, you also have your stories, right?
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.800]   I mean, every DFA advisor out there is saying,
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.480]   "We have Nobel Prize-winning economists
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.800]   giving us our information."
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.200]   I mean, so they have their stories too, Andi.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.840]   - Yeah, but the stories tend to be,
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.640]   let's say that they, well, by the way,
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.360]   of course I believe in more of these stories,
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.480]   but they are maybe more boring and abstract.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.720]   And we rarely have a colorful story to tell.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.160]   - Well, Cliff Asness wrote the foreword on the book
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.960]   and he reiterated something that you wrote in the book,
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:07.560]   which is, "Investors really have three options
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.960]   for dealing with this low expected return."
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.600]   He came up with these three things.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.000]   And number one, he said, "You could take more risk."
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.360]   Basically, you take more equity risk.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.840]   And which means you have to deal with more volatility.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.800]   That is one way in which you can increase
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.520]   your expected return.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.800]   So instead of doing 60/40, you do 70/30 or 80/20,
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.520]   but knowing that you're going to be having more risk,
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.440]   more volatility.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.320]   So that's one thing.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.280]   Secondly, he said, "You could incorporate
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   other sources of return, such as style premium,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.880]   multi-factor model, multi-factor fund of some sort."
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.160]   Which is what you had suggested.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.840]   And then he said, "The third thing is,
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.000]   you could do the John Bogle argument,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.400]   which is stay the course, write it out,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.600]   accept the lower return, no matter what."
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.840]   But I'll also add to that,
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.400]   something that you put in the book,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.320]   it also means you need to save more money.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.120]   Because according to your data,
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.820]   since the expected returns have fallen,
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.440]   people actually need to save more.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.400]   And in fact, the data that you had in your book
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.920]   was that instead of saving 10% per year,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.280]   you really need to try to save 20% per year.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.000]   So comment on all that, please.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.320]   - Yeah, yeah, no, it's a good summary.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.080]   And I would say that most investors
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.120]   have apparently taken a take more risk approach,
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.160]   and it can be more equity.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.760]   So then they go private equity
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.600]   with a smoothing advantage and so on.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.800]   So that I think is, and that somehow I found
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.320]   from historical data that it is so common
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.600]   when expected returns fall,
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:50.560]   investors are used to earning what they,
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.520]   they wanna keep earning what they are used to.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.920]   And then they adjust their portfolios
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.800]   and that could end in tears.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.880]   I like more the diversification story,
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.640]   but I also, I do like the last story,
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.040]   this Jack Bogle idea.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.080]   Just humbly accept that markets are now offering less
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:09.040]   and let's just do the best we can in that situation.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.160]   - Antti, thank you so much
