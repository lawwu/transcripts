[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   in the new year, it's a great joy to meet together in this online format.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.480]   I know that I was thinking I must be crazy committed to
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.600]   this ministry teaching this in the middle of the Super Bowl,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.080]   but I know that all of you are very committed to
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400]   the ministry by attending this session and don't worry,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.840]   we'll get you to the second half by the time we're done here.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.320]   But we're just glad that you're with us,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.960]   glad that you're able to join us for this hour,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.120]   and we're looking forward to a wonderful study tonight in the word of God.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.280]   Tonight, we're going to be looking at a subject that's
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.640]   very important for counseling ministry,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.240]   and we're going to be looking at counseling exam number 2,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.960]   which focuses on the topic of developing a caring relationship with your counselee,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.680]   developing a caring relationship with your counselee.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.080]   So tonight's study is going to be a very practical subject,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.640]   very necessary subject.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.440]   It's been well said that people don't care about
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.080]   how much you know unless they know how much you care.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.600]   I think that's true in ministry and in all of life
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.320]   that we want to be known as those who care for other people.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.840]   For the simple reason that Jesus cares for people and God the Father cares for us,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360]   and so because we have received such care and compassion from our Heavenly Father,
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.000]   we want to be ambassadors of Christ and express that care to others in the local church.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.480]   I've often prayed for the counseling ministry here at Kindred,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.040]   Lord give us a reputation for being caring and compassionate in our ministry.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.120]   I've just really prayed that those who know our counseling ministry,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.200]   that we would develop a reputation that if you go to counselors in this ministry,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.280]   that you will be cared for,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.720]   that you will find counselors who listen well,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.640]   you will find counselors who are filled with a spirit,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.400]   who are merciful and gracious.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.960]   We don't want to develop a reputation as a counseling center,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.240]   that if you go to that counseling center,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   they're going to just beat you over the head with the Bible.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.560]   We don't want that for our ministry.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.440]   We want to develop a reputation for being those who care for other people,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080]   for the simple reason again,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   that that's a reflection of the character of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.480]   Jesus saw the multitudes and he felt compassion for them.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920]   Tonight's session is a very practical subject.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.680]   It is a very necessary subject.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.040]   I'm going to say that tonight's subject really isn't a subject that's only
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.400]   applicable to doing "counseling ministry" in the church.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.360]   It really is applicable to all of our relationships.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.600]   I mean, if you think about all of the relationships that you have right now,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.480]   whether that be your family relationships or relationships in
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.840]   your community or relationships in your small group or in your church,
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.720]   if you think about all of the varying relationships that you have in life,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.280]   the question would simply be this,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.000]   are you known as a caring person?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Would those around you say that you genuinely care for other people's welfare and well-being?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.280]   Is that what others would say of you?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.840]   Because we don't want to just isolate this to doing "counseling ministry" in the church.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.600]   We want to grow in our compassion and our care for other people,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.440]   so that when we do have the opportunity to counsel others in the church,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.520]   that we have the opportunity to express
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   the character that the Spirit of God has been producing in us.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.640]   Sometimes we do care about other people in the church,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.440]   and we do care about other people in our relationships,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.960]   in our hearts, but we don't always know how to express that care.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.480]   We don't know how to develop the relational skills
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.800]   that would express that care to other people.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.160]   We may care about them in our hearts,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680]   but we don't know, for instance,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.000]   how to make the phone call,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.440]   or how to write the note,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.160]   or how to have the conversation,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.400]   or how to set up the appointment for coffee,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.440]   or how to create the gift that would express our care for others.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.400]   Caring for others is, I would say, a skill.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.880]   It is not only something that God puts in our hearts that we want to love other people,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.480]   but it's also something we need to develop in terms of our skill set,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.840]   in terms of how we actually practically let others know that we care for them.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.720]   So tonight's topic is very important,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.480]   developing a caring relationship with a counselee,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.680]   and I trust that we will be encouraged as well as challenged by tonight's teaching.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.360]   So let me pray for us and we will get into our study for tonight. Let's pray.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.880]   Father, we do thank you that your word says you care for us,
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.680]   that we can cast our anxieties upon you
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.280]   because you are a caring and a loving Heavenly Father
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.720]   who does meet us where we are in our everyday lives.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.240]   We thank you that Christ is a merciful and sympathetic High Priest,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.520]   that he literally feels the same things that we do,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.840]   for he has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:12.400]   Father, we pray that you would help us to understand your mercy and your compassion toward us,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.000]   that we would be good representatives of Christ in the counseling ministry that you would give to us,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.120]   and then also just in our relationships in everyday life.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.920]   Make us caring people, help us to be known by this in our everyday lives,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.320]   and may this be the hallmark of our counseling ministry,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.440]   that we not only speak the truth, but we do so in love.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.960]   Thank you for all my brothers and sisters who have joined us for this class tonight.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:53.640]   Would you bless their training and bless their ministry for we pray this all in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.880]   Amen. Just stay on a devotional thought for tonight's session.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.400]   As we're looking at the subject of developing a caring relationship with a counselee,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:12.040]   one of the books that I would highly recommend to you is the book Dane Ortlund's Gentle and Lowly.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:20.240]   This has been on the top 10, I believe, lists of many biblical counseling resources
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.920]   that the biblical counseling world has kind of embraced this book
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.880]   and has put this in the hands of biblical counselors.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.480]   It's not specifically a biblical counseling book,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.160]   but it is applicable to so much of what we do in counseling ministry.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.880]   I was just talking to some of the brothers today after church of how this book is rocking our worlds,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:54.680]   just saying some amazing things about Christ and about who Jesus is and how we need to reflect his character.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.480]   And I just commend this book to you.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.840]   And I think that some of the insights in Ortlund's book is applicable to our discussion tonight.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   And so he writes, and this is a reflection on Matthew 11, verses 28 to 30,
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.160]   where Jesus says, "Come unto me, all who labor and who are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.560]   And as you know, that text says, "I am gentle and lowly of heart."
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.200]   And Ortlund reflects on this passage, and he says,
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.480]   "In the one place in the Bible where the Son of God pulls back the veil
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.520]   and lets us peer way down into the core of who he is,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.560]   we're not told that he is austere and demanding in heart.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.480]   We're not told that he is exalted and dignified in heart.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.160]   We're not even told that he is joyful and generous in heart.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:53.040]   Letting Jesus set the terms, his surprising claim is that he is gentle and lowly in heart."
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:01.000]   And he continues that one thing to get straight right from the start is that when the Bible speaks of the heart,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.440]   whether Old Testament or new, it is not speaking of our emotional life only,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.760]   but of the central animating center of all we do.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   Speaking of the heart, it is what gets us out of bed in the morning
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.240]   and what we daydream about as we drift off to sleep.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.000]   It is our motivation headquarters.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.400]   The heart in biblical terms is not part of who we are, but the center of who we are.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.440]   Our heart is what defines and directs us.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.160]   The heart is a matter of life.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   It is what makes us the human being each of us is.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.800]   The heart drives all we do.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.000]   It is who we are.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.600]   And if you've been with us in our year one biblical counseling training,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   at this point, you should be saying amen and amen.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.120]   We have learned of the importance of the biblical concept of the heart.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.800]   It is out of the heart that flows the issues of life.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:05.120]   Now Orlin takes that concept of the heart and he makes this astounding observation
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.720]   that Jesus in this text describes his own heart.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.800]   This is the one time in scripture that we find Jesus tell us what is his heart like
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.600]   in terms of a direct explanation of what is his heart like
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.000]   and what can his heart be compared to.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.240]   So Orlin writes, when Jesus tells us what animates him most deeply,
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.200]   what is most true of him, when he exposes the innermost recesses of his being,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.680]   what we find there is gentle and lowly.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   I am gentle, Jesus says.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.840]   Jesus is not trigger happy, not harsh, reactionary, easily exasperated.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.800]   He is the most understanding person in the universe.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.160]   Think about that for a moment, brothers and sisters,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.320]   as we reflect on the character of Christ.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.520]   Jesus is the most understanding person in the universe.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:20.320]   The posture most natural to him is not a pointed finger, but open arms.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.480]   Or that God might raise up biblical counselors in the church
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.600]   who reflect something of this character.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:38.120]   Counselors who are understanding and whose posture is not that of a pointed finger,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:44.840]   but the posture of open arms for those who come for counseling.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.160]   He reflects on the statement, I am lowly of heart.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.200]   The meaning of the word lowly overlaps with that of gentle,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.560]   together communicating a single reality about Jesus's heart.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:03.360]   The point in saying that Jesus is lowly is that he is accessible
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.520]   for all his resplendent glory and dazzling holiness,
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.680]   his supreme uniqueness and otherness.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:19.360]   No one in history, in human history has ever been more approachable than Jesus Christ.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.320]   No prerequisites, no hoops to jump through.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.520]   Again, as I reflect on the character of Christ,
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.440]   it is on one hand a truth that ought to drive us to worship,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:42.360]   but also a truth that ought to have us reflect on our own ministry.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.960]   Does our character reflect something of the sweetness of Christ?
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.680]   And as we relate to others, would others say of us that we are approachable?
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.360]   No prerequisites, no hoops to jump through.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:06.880]   Gentle and lowly, this is, according to his own testimony, is Christ's very heart.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:17.880]   This is who he is, tender, open, welcoming, accommodating, understanding, willing.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.520]   If we are asked to say only one thing about who Jesus is,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.280]   we would be honoring Jesus's own teaching if our answer is gentle and lowly.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.760]   If Jesus hosted his own personal website,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.680]   the most prominent line of the "About Me" dropdown would read,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.240]   "Gentle and lowly in heart."
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.600]   Just a beautiful reflection of the loveliness of Christ.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   And if you're getting a taste of what this book is about,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:58.120]   you would understand why it was ranked in the top 10 of biblical counseling resources
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.560]   of the last year.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.560]   Those beautiful descriptions of who Christ is
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.720]   are at the center of counseling ministry as well,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.160]   to be Christ-centered in our counseling ministries,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.560]   to express something of this character.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:24.720]   Tenderness, openness, welcoming, accommodating, understanding, willing.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.280]   Not with the pointed finger of self-righteous judgment,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   but the gentle and lowly character of Christ.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.240]   I think you can see how this brief reflection on Christ's character
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.160]   is applicable for our topic tonight.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.720]   Because as we look at counseling exam number two,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.800]   the question is simply this, "Describe at least six biblical strategies
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.160]   to develop a caring relationship with your counselees."
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.400]   We're talking here about caring for people.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.760]   The question asks you to clearly identify each strategy
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.560]   and ground its use in specific passages of Scripture,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:18.560]   explaining its practical utility in building a relationship.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.080]   And we are going to get into the nuts and bolts
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.120]   of how we are to express care for people,
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.640]   and also the nuts and bolts of how we should write this essay
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.040]   in counseling exam number two.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:40.560]   But just for a moment, I want you to reflect on the gentleness
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.440]   and the lowliness of Christ's heart.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.960]   Is this not what we are called to do in counseling ministry?
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.720]   And not just in counseling ministry, but in every relationship
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.480]   God has given to us on this earth.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:00.160]   Are we not called to express this type of gentleness, kindness,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.760]   respect, humility, servanthood,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.240]   considering others more important than ourselves,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.880]   approachability, welcoming, not a judgmental spirit,
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.920]   but a spirit that hopes the best, believes the best?
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.800]   Are we not called to express this type of character?
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   And if we do, will not those around us say of us
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.080]   that this person really does care about me?
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.840]   I've been amazed in counseling ministry
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.120]   that when our counselors, and even in a small way,
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.840]   when I've had the privilege of counseling other believers
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.400]   and when you really do let them know that you care about them,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.520]   how disarming that is, how barriers fall down,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.480]   how people's guards drop,
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.600]   and they start to open up about their lives
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.520]   and they start to let you address the issues of the heart.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.840]   Often in counseling, I'll ask the question
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.280]   and those who have observed me counsel have said this of me,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.520]   that I'll often ask for permission.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.640]   Is it okay if I address you with the Word of God?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.840]   Are you comfortable with talking about this issue of your life
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.000]   in light of God's Word?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.680]   And it is amazing that when counselees really are assured
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.760]   of your care for them, how they'll say, "Let's go at it.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.440]   Let's deal with the issues."
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.120]   And I've observed that with our other counselors as well.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.920]   When they show that they care, people are open.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.520]   True and genuine care for people is powerful.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.040]   People respond to that type of love and compassion,
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.720]   and they will be open to hearing some really hard truths
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.040]   if you show them that you really do care about them.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   And so this question is dealing with developing
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.480]   that caring relationship,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.520]   and it's talking about six biblical strategies
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   to develop that type of care.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.920]   Now, what I'm going to do in our teaching tonight
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.880]   is I'm going to give you a laundry list
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.320]   of biblical strategies.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.560]   I'm just going to give you a number of different things
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.640]   that you can consider.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.080]   I'm not going to be able to go into each of them
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.680]   in great detail, but what I want to do
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.520]   is kind of prime the pump and give you some ideas
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.040]   as to the strategies that you can employ
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.560]   in developing a caring relationship with your counselees.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.440]   And what you're going to do in this essay
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.000]   is you're going to pick six of maybe,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.520]   as you're thinking through these strategies,
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.120]   the Lord will direct you to six of these strategies
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.760]   that you find to be most applicable in your own life,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.880]   or maybe even the most challenging in your own life,
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.000]   and then write about these six strategies.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.920]   You would do well to write a six-paragraph essay
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.240]   for this topic, just a paragraph for each strategy,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.120]   and just make it real simple.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.760]   Each paragraph would have the strategy,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   some passages of scripture,
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.840]   which talk about the importance of that strategy,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.800]   and then how practically that would show itself
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.680]   in your counseling ministry.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.900]   So we're looking at six biblical strategies
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.480]   to develop a caring relationship.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.400]   Now, before we go any further, let me just orient you
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.720]   and show you the forest before we look at the trees.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.020]   You'll remember this slide from last week's teaching.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.840]   In last week's teaching,
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.100]   we looked at the six key elements of biblical counseling,
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.200]   or what we call the six I's of biblical counseling.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.600]   These are the practical skills
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.560]   that we employ in counseling,
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.560]   and we really do evaluate a counselor's practical methods
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.760]   according to the six I's of biblical counseling.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.400]   I sent you a case study and a role-play assignment
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.900]   that I did with a couple of our counselors,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.440]   and I'll send you another one this upcoming week.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.120]   And as the counselor did the role-play,
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.280]   what we tell them beforehand
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.440]   is that we're going to evaluate your counseling skills
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.560]   according to the six I's.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.360]   We're gonna ask the question,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.320]   is the counselor showing involvement?
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.040]   Is there good inventory, good questions being asked?
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.640]   Is there biblical discernment being applied?
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.760]   Does the counselor give hope?
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.120]   Does the counselor open God's word?
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.280]   And is there homework assigned?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.600]   We're evaluating the counselor's ministry
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.300]   according to the six I's of counseling.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.720]   And so what I would encourage you to do
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.080]   as you do counseling observation,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.520]   and even as you may have done the IBCD
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.600]   10 hours of counseling observation,
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.800]   or if you have the opportunities to observe live counseling,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.560]   what I would encourage you to do is not just say,
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.400]   well, I like what that counselor did,
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.480]   or I didn't like what that counselor did,
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.520]   or I like this counselor, I don't like this counselor.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.720]   What I would encourage you to do
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   is evaluate how a counselor is
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.520]   showing the six I's of biblical counseling
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.120]   in his or her counseling ministry.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.440]   Be asking the questions,
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   does this counselor demonstrate care and compassion?
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.240]   Does this counselor ask good questions
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   and seek to understand the counselee's situation?
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.440]   Does this counselor give hope?
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.120]   Has the counselor taken the counselee to the word of God
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.960]   and opened the Bible?
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.520]   So be asking the questions that are related
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.260]   to the six I's of biblical counseling,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.100]   and that will help you to evaluate
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.760]   as you observe other counselors,
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.400]   and even to evaluate your own counseling.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.680]   We are always asking these questions is,
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.100]   am I growing in the six key elements of biblical counseling?
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.100]   And am I showing these elements in my counseling ministry?
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.040]   So we did an overview of that last week
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.920]   for session number one,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.620]   and I told you that for counseling essay number one,
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.240]   you would do well to write an essay
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.320]   on four of the six I's of biblical counseling,
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.080]   that you're really just taking one key element
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.520]   in each paragraph and writing a four-paragraph essay
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.340]   if that's one suggestive way to write this essay
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.740]   is a four-paragraph essay,
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.740]   one on each I of the key elements of biblical counseling.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.220]   And that would be a strategy to write essay number one.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.200]   You're really taking one key element at a time
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.780]   and doing a brief overview of four to five
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.660]   of the six key elements of biblical counseling.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.380]   Now, just to show you the context
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.860]   of what we're gonna do tonight is in essay number two,
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.360]   what we're doing is we're zeroing in
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.820]   on the first key element of biblical counseling,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.340]   which is the element of involvement.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.740]   So essay number one,
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.260]   you've kind of done an overview
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.540]   of four of the six I's of biblical counseling.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.780]   For essay number two,
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.120]   you're zeroing in on the first key element,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.900]   which is involvement,
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.900]   and then showing six strategies or practical applications
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.660]   of the key element of involvement.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.660]   So I hope that makes sense.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.940]   I just wanna orient you as to the flow of these essays
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.580]   and where we are in considering
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.360]   the six key elements of biblical counseling.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.340]   So the question would be,
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.820]   why are we writing an entire essay on involvement?
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.040]   Why of the six I's of biblical counseling
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.420]   does involvement get its own essay?
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.400]   And there are a number of ways we can answer that question,
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.760]   but I think on a practical level,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.000]   this would be admittedly maybe some of the weaknesses
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.200]   of the biblical counseling movement up to this point
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   is to be known more for truth than being known for love.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.220]   And the biblical balance is always speaking the truth
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.340]   in love, Ephesians chapter four.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.700]   We need to hold those two in balance.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.580]   We believe in the authority
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.420]   and the sufficiency of God's word,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.420]   and we also want to express love and care for people.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.340]   And so I think this essay is very important in our training
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.340]   because it causes us to reflect on our relational skills
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.160]   and are we speaking to others the truth
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.160]   in the context of a loving, caring, respectful relationship.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:19.340]   And I think that's a necessary balance for our ministry.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.880]   So we are dealing with the subject of involvement.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.660]   So to help us with this on page one of your handout,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.640]   I have a few resources that I think will be helpful for you.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.620]   I have Wayne Mack's Developing a Helping Relationship
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.000]   with Counselees, which is a PDF
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.220]   that I sent to you this week.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.380]   You can also find that material in the work
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.300]   that was edited by John MacArthur,
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.180]   Counseling, How to Counsel Biblically.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.980]   Wayne Mack has a chapter in there
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.060]   on developing a helping relationship with a counselee,
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.460]   and it's essentially the same material.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.740]   You can either read the journal article
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.980]   or you can get the printed book,
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.540]   but that essay really is all that you really need
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.560]   to write this essay.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.300]   He gives you a laundry list of different ways
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.760]   to develop this relationship,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.260]   and it's just a very, very helpful resource.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.780]   And so do star that resource.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.700]   That would be an essential resource to write this essay
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.660]   and one that I would highly encourage
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.060]   that you read and apply to life.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.500]   In addition, I would encourage you
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   to get Jeremy Pierre and Mark Shaw's chapter
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.940]   in the book, Christ-Centered Biblical Counseling,
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:41.780]   which is entitled,
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.140]   The Nature of the Biblical Counseling Relationship.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.140]   Just some excellent supplementary reading
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.100]   on that subject that will also prime the pump
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.880]   to help us to understand the key element of involvement.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   One additional resource that I would recommend to you
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.540]   is Paul Tripp's Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands,
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.340]   chapter seven and chapter eight.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.780]   Those two chapters deal with the key element of involvement.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.500]   Tripp doesn't call it involvement.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   He has the overview of love, know, speak, do.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.620]   As we mentioned in year one,
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.900]   that's sort of an alternate way
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.100]   to talk about the key elements of biblical counseling,
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.580]   but he categorizes it under the heading of love,
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.620]   which is essentially the same thing we're trying to do.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.060]   So you can read chapter seven and chapter eight
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.820]   of Paul Tripp's Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.380]   as review, and that will help you to write this essay
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.460]   as well.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.200]   So just some resources there that will help you
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.460]   to think through the issue of involvement.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:00.460]   Now, let me move to page two of your notes for tonight
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.760]   and just restate the definition of involvement,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.460]   and then we'll talk about practical strategies in a moment.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.000]   We saw in our year one training
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.340]   that involvement can be defined as the ministry
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.200]   of expressing Christlike love and compassion
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.500]   so that a relationship can be built,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.660]   marked by trust and openness.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.660]   Involvement is the ministry of expressing Christlike love
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.520]   and compassion so that a relationship can be built,
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.140]   marked by trust and openness.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.780]   As we stated in year one,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.780]   biblical counseling then is not a clinical type of ministry.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.900]   It's not you as a professional counselor
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.540]   dispensing information from on high,
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.180]   but it is coming alongside a fellow brother or sister
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:59.180]   in Christ and loving them as a blood-bought believer
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.420]   in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.180]   loving them as a brother or sister in the Lord,
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.140]   being a fellow member of the body of Christ
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.340]   and showing the type of mercy and compassion
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.340]   that the Lord would express in his own ministry.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.380]   And so this is the key element of involvement.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.800]   And we looked at key passages
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.700]   such as 1 Thessalonians 2, verse seven,
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.380]   Paul's own expression of compassion and gentleness.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.020]   He said of his ministry to the Thessalonians in verse seven,
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.340]   "We were gentle among you,
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.840]   like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.900]   So being affectionately desirous of you,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.300]   we're ready to share with you not only the gospel of God,
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.420]   but our own selves,
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.160]   because you had become very dear to us."
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   I don't know any way to do this in any other way.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.540]   You will love your counselees
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.540]   and you will find that you not only love your counselees,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.300]   you will find that you like your counselees.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.620]   You will be sad when the counseling sessions end.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.620]   Your counselees will be sad when the counseling sessions end
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.540]   because this is just New Testament ministry.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.220]   I think any true believer in Christ filled with the spirit
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.700]   and filled with the love for Christ
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.540]   will love other believers in Christ
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.460]   who serve the same Lord and have the same spirit.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.300]   And so Paul says,
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.020]   "We didn't just dispense information to you.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.020]   We loved you.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.460]   We were affectionate towards you.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.920]   We had a genuine desire to serve you in the Lord."
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.640]   And he even goes on to say in verse 20,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.300]   "For what is our hope or joy or crown
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.920]   or boasting before the Lord Jesus at his coming?
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.080]   Is it not you?
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.860]   For you are our glory and joy."
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.180]   I mean, what a thought that some of your counselees
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.340]   in the future will be your grounds of boasting
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.460]   before the Lord at his coming.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.060]   You make an investment in people's souls
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.780]   and souls live forever.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.980]   And there may be Lord willing,
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:24.020]   those who are saved through the counseling ministry
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.680]   that you will be engaged in,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.460]   or those who are saved and who will be sanctified
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.180]   as a result of you reaching out into their lives.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.460]   And when Jesus returns, that fruit will be lasting.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.860]   There are many things that you can invest in,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.860]   in this life that really have little or no eternal value.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:51.580]   But when you invest in souls, souls live forever.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   And so what a thought that those you invest in,
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.360]   in this ministry may be the grounds of your boasting
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.020]   at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.560]   So we don't merely fix problems.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.260]   Can I put it that way?
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.260]   We minister to people.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.500]   We're not problem oriented.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.300]   We are people oriented.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.380]   As Dr. Robert Jones has well said,
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.460]   I don't counsel anxiety.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.160]   I don't counsel anger.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.840]   I don't counsel depression.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.100]   I counsel Bill.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:34.620]   And Bill may struggle with anxiety and anger,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.500]   but I'm ministering to this person.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.760]   God has given to me this privilege of serving this person.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.740]   We tell our counselees, it is a privilege to serve you.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.020]   And it really is.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:53.180]   It's a privilege to walk alongside you in ministry.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.820]   What a privilege to be part of a ministry
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.660]   where people come to this ministry
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.300]   and they share openly about their lives.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.840]   They tell you what they're struggling with.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.180]   They open up their heart to you
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.800]   and you have an opportunity to speak the truth and love.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.020]   I mean, what a privilege
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.660]   to walk alongside others in this way.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.180]   And it is just a joy.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.820]   It's a privilege to serve you.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.100]   And so I don't counsel problems.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.940]   I counsel people.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   And those people become very near and dear to your heart.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.700]   I've noticed that some of our counselors
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.940]   that we've trained in this ministry
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.100]   who really are just great.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:51.620]   They have far outpaced my own ability to counsel.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.100]   They have taken what I've taught them
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.540]   and they've just ran with it.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.780]   And just what a joy to see them thrive in this ministry.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.000]   And then to also see that these counselors
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.420]   have a hard time getting off campus on Sunday
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.580]   because they've so honed and refined some of these skills
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.500]   of showing care for others
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   that so many people just need ministry
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.780]   and they know where to find a caring counselor.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.500]   And so it's a godly struggle.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.660]   It's a good struggle,
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:29.620]   but just these counselors will say to me,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.900]   "Dan, I have trouble getting off campus on Sunday
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.180]   because people come to me now for ministry."
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.980]   And what a privilege, what a joy.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.100]   If you develop a reputation for being a caring counselor,
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.020]   you will have that type of ministry in people's lives.
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.820]   So we minister to people.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.220]   We don't just fix problems.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.740]   We're in the people business,
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:57.460]   which means we have to learn relational skills.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.420]   Some of us are more wired towards studying the Bible
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.140]   and we just know a lot of truth
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.880]   and we know a lot of theology,
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.020]   but we're mean and unkind
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.740]   and we can be short with people and impatient
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.700]   and we need to really learn the relational side of ministry.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.460]   And others of us are just wired for relationships
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.500]   and we just love people,
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.940]   but our counseling does not have enough theology
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.580]   and we need to work hard on the other side
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.680]   of studying the Bible and learning the truth of God.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.200]   It's truth and love.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.260]   So if you look at the middle of that handout
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.780]   or further down, I'm gonna skip some of those quotations,
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.420]   but Proverbs 27, verse six is a really good summary,
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.380]   I think, of the essence of counseling ministry,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.380]   where the proverb says, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend."
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:58.740]   You wanna be that friend to others in ministry.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.340]   Verse nine says, "Oil and perfume make the heart glad
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.920]   "and the sweetness of a friend
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.620]   "comes from his earnest counsel."
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.940]   I have counselors in my life.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.380]   Some people think that once you become a pastor,
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.120]   you never need anyone to counsel you
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.020]   and that's far from the truth.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.380]   Counselors need other counselors
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:28.380]   and I have counselors in my life who are dear friends.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.260]   They give earnest counsel and they love me in the Lord
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.500]   and I trust them with my life.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.100]   I have no problem opening up to them
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.300]   about what's going on with my spiritual walk
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.060]   and what's going on with my family
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.620]   and what's going on with my ministry
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.340]   because I know that they have given me earnest counsel,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.040]   that they are good friends to me
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.540]   and I pray that I may be that type of friend to others
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.440]   and that you might be that type of friend to others
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.600]   who need that type of earnest counsel.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.640]   And so the sweetness of a friend
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.320]   comes from his earnest counsel.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.160]   And then I try to remind myself,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.620]   this again is just basic New Testament ministry.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.320]   This is not just counseling ministry,
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.600]   this is just being a New Testament believer.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.660]   Romans 12, verse 10,
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.360]   "Love one another with brotherly affection,
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.440]   "outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.060]   "Do not be slothful and zeal,
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.020]   "be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.200]   "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.680]   "be constant in prayer,
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.380]   "contribute to the needs of the saints
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.160]   "and seek to show hospitality.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.720]   "Bless those who persecute you,
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.780]   "bless and do not curse them.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.460]   "Rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.760]   "weep with those who weep."
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.480]   I mean, if our counselors
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:01.200]   just followed those basic New Testament commands,
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   we would exercise a very powerful ministry by God's grace.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.700]   I try to remind myself when I counsel
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.460]   that I'm a member of the body of Christ
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.360]   and I counsel as an expression of the body of Christ,
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.160]   which means I have the responsibility
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.640]   of representing Christ.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.880]   Not just giving correct information,
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.360]   but representing his character, his methods,
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.640]   his ways, his perspective, his outlook on life.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.920]   How would Jesus see this person
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.840]   who is coming for counseling ministry?
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   And if I am a member of his body
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   and if he is the head of that body,
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.040]   then I have a responsibility
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.760]   to reflect something of his character
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.360]   and his perspective and his outlook.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.080]   And I've given that privilege
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   to be an expression of the body of Christ.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.000]   I pray that that would be true of you as well.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.360]   If you move to page three of your handout,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.880]   this is an overview of the relational qualities
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.600]   that reflect the character of Christ.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.680]   We cover this in year one.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.120]   We're not gonna go into this in any detail,
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.880]   but just looking down that list,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.440]   I can't read this list of compassion, humility,
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.000]   gentleness, patience, so forth and so on.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.360]   I can't ever read that list
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.180]   without being challenged in my own life, can you?
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:39.320]   ACBC has actually listed on their website,
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.920]   they have a document that's called
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.880]   Standards of Conduct for Biblical Counselors.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.320]   And I remember Dr. Stuart Scott encouraging anyone
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.040]   who is in counseling ministry to review that
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.180]   at least on a yearly basis.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:59.040]   And he was remarking that it is impossible
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.800]   to read through that document
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.960]   without being challenged afresh and anew
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.000]   of just ways that we need to grow,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.560]   of being even rebuked and corrected,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.480]   reproved as to our lack of showing these qualities
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.760]   in our everyday lives.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.880]   And so I just encourage you to be constantly
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.320]   reviewing these things and challenging yourself,
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.560]   how can I better express the character of Christ?
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.120]   With that said, just as an overview,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   I just wanna mention this for a moment.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.760]   ACBC Standards of Conduct has an entire section
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.880]   on commitment to care.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.360]   I didn't put this in your notes,
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.700]   but you can find this on their website,
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.440]   or I'll send out a link to you this week.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.880]   And just the basic statement there,
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.320]   without going into much detail,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.240]   that the call to engage in counseling conversations
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.140]   is the call to love others well.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.960]   And they're just trying to summarize this basic idea
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.160]   that we are called not only to communicate truth,
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:13.040]   we are called to love people and to express care.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.380]   And they have four different areas
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.920]   that I'll briefly review.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.080]   Caring for counselors and sacrificing time for them.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.140]   You have caring for counselors
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.340]   through tangible acts of care.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.520]   You have caring for counselors in deciding
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.000]   whether or not to charge fees for counseling.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.160]   Our own counseling ministry
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.560]   does not charge fees for counseling.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.940]   In the ACBC world generally,
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.880]   we do not charge fees for counseling.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.240]   There are some situations where charging a fee
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.600]   or a suggested donation might be appropriate,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.020]   but they're just saying there
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.920]   that you wanna communicate that clearly
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.480]   what policy you have on charging fees.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.080]   And then they have a statement on caring for counselees
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.760]   in protecting the weak from harm.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.720]   And I would just encourage you
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.440]   to think through that document and read that,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.200]   and you can get more detail on that from the website.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:17.620]   Let me move then to page, I believe this is page number four.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:22.840]   And what I'm gonna do here as just an overview
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.380]   is I'm gonna give you in summary,
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.000]   Wayne Mac has 18 strategies
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.020]   to develop a caring relationship.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.700]   If you read the chapter in Christ-Centered Biblical Counseling
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.360]   by Jeremy Pierre and Mark Shaw,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.560]   they have 10 strategies
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.720]   for developing a caring relationship.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.160]   And then I've developed just from my own experience
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.720]   and observing counselors in our own counseling ministry,
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.680]   I've developed 13 strategies
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.560]   for developing a caring relationship.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.520]   So if you add all that up, 18, 10, and 13,
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.320]   we have potentially 41 practical strategies
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.140]   for developing a caring relationship
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.500]   in this document and in our course notes.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   Now, you only need six to write an essay on this subject.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.200]   So what I would encourage you to do
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.940]   is we're gonna just go rapid pace and just bullet point,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.160]   here are some strategies,
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.380]   and you'll find that many of them overlap in some ways,
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.120]   but just pick out as we walk through this,
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.740]   what are the six strategies that you find most interesting
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.580]   or the most convicting or the most challenging,
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:33.100]   or maybe you haven't thought about that strategy before,
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.900]   and you want to just do some more reflection on that.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.620]   Choose six, and you can even star them as we go along.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.020]   We're gonna go fairly rapidly,
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.940]   but we'll just go through as an overview
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.620]   some of these strategies,
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.700]   and then for your essay purposes,
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   choose six and do a further study on those six strategies.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.100]   And I hope this will prime the pump
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.040]   for you to write this essay.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   So let me go through some of Wayne Mack's 18 strategies,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.380]   and you will find this on his document
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.500]   or his journal article,
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.380]   "Developing a Caring Relationship with a Counselee."
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.980]   He says, "Strategy number one is think about
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.200]   "how you would feel if you were in the counselee's position.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.040]   "Jesus showed compassion.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.560]   "Compassion is your pain in my heart,
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.620]   "and so placing yourself in the position of a counselee,
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.960]   "seeing the world through their eyes."
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.500]   We talked about in year one,
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.760]   the whole idea of if you're a five-year-old,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.020]   and if you've lost a blanket,
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.220]   you've lost your world, you've lost your security,
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.920]   you've lost what you hold dear,
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.040]   and maybe a 45-year-old would look at that five-year-old
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.800]   and say, "Hey, it's not a big deal.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.420]   "It's just a blanket.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.920]   "We can get you another blanket."
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.360]   But entering that person's world
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.960]   means not seeing the blanket
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.360]   through the eyes of a 45-year-old adult,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.860]   but seeing that blanket through the eyes of the five-year-old
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.700]   who has just lost his or her blanket.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.620]   And that's essentially a strategy
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.320]   for developing a caring relationship
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.000]   is seeing life through the eyes of a counselee.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Number two, think of the counselee as a family member.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.560]   When I counsel, I try to ask the question
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.480]   if my wife or my son or my daughter
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.040]   were to really need counseling,
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.160]   and if they were to go to a biblical counselor,
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.000]   what would I want that counselor to be like?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.500]   What type of care would I want that counselor
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   to express to my son or my daughter?
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:59.580]   And then I try to be that type of counselor to this person,
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.020]   because I need to be reminded
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.180]   this person is someone's son or daughter.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:14.060]   And so think of the counselee as a family member.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.660]   How would you treat one of your close relatives?
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.860]   What tone of voice would you use?
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.580]   What words would you use?
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.580]   What approach would you use to help that person?
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.500]   In reality, our counselees are
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.900]   our spiritual brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.400]   Number three, think about your own sinfulness.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.220]   Always remind yourself
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.860]   that you are not immune to sin yourself.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.060]   Be on guard against the spirit of self-righteousness
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.860]   that says, "Well, I would never sin in this way,"
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.900]   or, "I would never do what this counselee has done."
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.500]   I think one of the greatest ways
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.260]   to hinder a caring relationship
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.460]   is to allow self-righteousness to grow in your heart,
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.180]   is to go home after a counseling session and say,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:10.180]   "Boy, my counselee is just way out there.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.900]   "They have strayed so far.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.820]   "I would never do that.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.960]   "Oh, really?"
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   Theologically, is that true?
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.040]   Each of us have a sin nature,
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.180]   and it is by the grace of God
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.620]   that we have been protected from certain sins,
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.040]   and so if we have made any progress in our sanctification,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.620]   we should say with Paul, "By the grace of God,
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.700]   "I am what I am."
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.520]   So think about your own sinfulness
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.820]   when you're tempted to judge.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.460]   Number four, think of practical ways to show compassion,
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.740]   telling your counselee that you care.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:55.580]   I don't think people will ever hear that too much.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:00.260]   There are certain things that people never tire of.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.080]   I don't think there's ever a problem
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.000]   with a counselee that I've had
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.880]   where my counselee has said to me,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.400]   "Dan, I just am too encouraged.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.860]   "I'm just experiencing too much encouragement,
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.140]   "and so don't encourage me anymore."
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.340]   I've never heard that.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.220]   Anyone say that to me?
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.540]   That just stop encouraging me
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.180]   because that's my problem is I'm just overloaded with hope.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.340]   There are certain things,
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.460]   just telling your counselee, "I care about you.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.400]   "We love you in the Lord.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.960]   "We want you to grow.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.160]   "I'm thankful for you."
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.460]   Paul always told people he ministered to
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.540]   that, "I'm thankful for you.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.660]   "I'm always thanking God for you."
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.700]   He even said that of the Corinthians
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.220]   who had a lot of problems.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.700]   But he said, "I thank God for you
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.860]   "and for the fellowship that we have in Christ."
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.620]   Praying for them, rejoicing and grieving
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.440]   with your counselee.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.740]   I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.660]   Dealing with your counselee gently and tenderly,
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:15.260]   being tactful, speaking with graciousness,
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.000]   continuing to love and accept them
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.800]   even when they reject your counsel.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   So I was told this by another counselor
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.960]   that whatever your counselee's sin issue is,
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   they will at some point sin that sin against you
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.520]   if they're struggling with anger.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.080]   At some point in the counseling relationship,
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.340]   they're gonna get angry with you.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.340]   And so just learning to forgive,
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.520]   learning to pray for that counselee,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.360]   forgiving them of any wrong that they've done to you,
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.860]   being willing to meet their physical needs.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.940]   Not that you have to do all of that yourself,
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.500]   but just engaging the body of Christ
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.620]   in the counseling process is helpful.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.820]   Using proper verbal communication,
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.580]   gentleness, sweetness of speech,
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.880]   using proper nonverbal communication.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.700]   Wayne Mack has this helpful acronym,
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.220]   SOLVER, squared soldiers, open stance,
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.540]   lean forward slightly, vocal quality,
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.800]   eye contact and relational posture.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.980]   I think that's just a helpful overview
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.700]   of just think through posture,
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.860]   think through nonverbal communication,
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.660]   how you're communicating care for others
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.700]   by how you're even sitting
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.700]   or how you're speaking to others in terms of tone of voice.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:47.160]   Going back to continuing the list,
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.820]   taking the counselee's problems seriously,
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.820]   never minimize the problems presented by your counselees.
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:51:00.380]   You may be even going through a trial
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.220]   that is objectively 10 times greater
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.500]   than what your counselee is going through,
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.380]   but don't use that as an opportunity
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.100]   to minimize their struggle.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.100]   What your counselee is going through
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.580]   is significant to him or her.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.660]   And so never minimizing that,
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.140]   never saying, well, I've got a bigger trial
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.540]   or I went through a bigger trial than you are
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.540]   and I came out fine.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.100]   But just acknowledging that what this person
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.900]   is going through in his or her experience
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:37.380]   is very real and very big to them.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.860]   Trusting your counselee,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.580]   believe what your counselee says.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.900]   I mean, this is a good rule of thumb
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.540]   is just believing what they say
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.220]   unless you have facts to prove otherwise.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:57.680]   Bringing a suspicious attitude into a counseling session
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.720]   is one way to really break down that caring relationship.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:07.180]   And so you're asking questions in order to gather data,
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.780]   but you're not asking questions
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.580]   like a lawyer would cross-examine a defendant.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.100]   You're not bringing a suspicious attitude
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.900]   into that relationship.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.020]   Expressing confidence in your counselee,
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.540]   as Paul did to the Corinthians
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.700]   in 2 Corinthians 7, verse 16,
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.540]   "I rejoice because I have complete confidence
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.380]   in you."
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.220]   I mean, so many times you're coming alongside people
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.540]   and just saying, "I know you can do this.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.980]   I know that you can complete this assignment.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.720]   I know you can grow in this area.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.960]   I have confidence in you
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.980]   because I know that you're a Christian,
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.380]   you're filled with the spirit of God.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:47.260]   I know you can grow in this."
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.020]   Or just saying, "I know you can go home
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.400]   and apologize to your wife.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.720]   I'm gonna pray for you
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.960]   and I'm eager and excited to hear how that goes
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.900]   because I think it's gonna go well
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.060]   if you humble yourself.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.300]   And I know you can do that by the grace of God."
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.700]   Just being an encourager in that way
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.380]   is helpful in this relationship.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.440]   Welcoming your counselee's input,
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.900]   even asking, "How can I grow as a counselor?
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:19.100]   Is there anything here that you can help me with
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:24.100]   in terms of me growing as a minister of Christ?"
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.780]   He mentions maintaining confidentiality,
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.940]   which is, I think, essential.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.880]   Building a relationship of trust.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.240]   We do practice limited confidentiality,
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.840]   not absolute confidentiality.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:43.360]   So there are times where you do need to go to an elder
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.540]   or go to your elder board
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.740]   or go to a pastor with an issue.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.460]   But if that's not the case,
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.680]   in most sessions,
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.760]   there is practiced,
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.700]   ought to be practiced confidentiality.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.700]   Just being trustworthy with that information.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.900]   You should not be in a counseling session
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.980]   and then sharing with your small group
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.420]   what went on in that session
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.360]   or sharing with anyone else what happened in that session.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.020]   Most of the counseling sessions,
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:15.020]   even that I oversee in our counseling ministry,
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.220]   I don't know the details as a pastor
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.980]   unless I really need to know.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:24.860]   The counselors practice confidentiality as much as possible
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.660]   because that builds trust
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.020]   to know that you're going to be discreet
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.400]   with information that is shared.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.300]   And then he has being honest about your own qualifications,
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.260]   being honest about your own weaknesses,
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.580]   being honest about your own goals and agenda,
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:45.360]   being honest about your own limitations.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.620]   Be balanced with this.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.860]   You don't need to overshare about your weaknesses.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.140]   You don't want to make the session
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.500]   all about you and your problems,
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.100]   but there are appropriate times in counseling
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.500]   where it's just appropriate to insert,
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.180]   I'm wrestling with this just as you are.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.940]   I've often counseled husbands
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.700]   with 1 Peter 3, verse seven,
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.900]   husbands live with your wives in an understanding way.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.580]   And as I've counseled them, I've shared with them,
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.900]   I'm trying to learn this in my own,
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.780]   in my own marriage and express this type of care
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.780]   for my own wife.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.340]   And it's a battle for me as well.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.540]   I'm seeking to grow and be challenged as well
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.000]   alongside of you.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.100]   And so just in appropriate times,
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.640]   being willing to share your own weaknesses.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:41.700]   Jeremy Pierre and Mark Shaw have 10 strategies
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.500]   doing the hard work of listening well.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.500]   It does take time and patience,
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.820]   just not being distracted,
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.460]   not looking at the bird that's flying out in the sky,
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:00.020]   in the window, not being distracted by texts,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.220]   or I always have my phone off when I counsel,
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.460]   just not even on silent, just have your phone off.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.980]   I encourage my counselee to have his phone off
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:10.860]   as we counsel.
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.660]   I'm respecting you by devoting this time to you.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.880]   And I ask you to respect this time as well
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.740]   by having your phone off and having no distractions.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.740]   And just listening well, learning to take judicious notes.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:32.860]   Different counselors have different styles of taking notes.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.720]   Some counselors like to take more notes, some take less.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.400]   I personally like to take minimal notes in this session.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.980]   I like to keep eye contact and just try to stay concentrated
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.460]   and stay focused on what the counselee is saying.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.100]   I will write down specific information,
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.660]   especially names when the counselee shares
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:57.500]   about his wife's name or his children's name,
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.000]   or his mom or dad's name.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.200]   I wanna write that down.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.620]   I wanna learn those names.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.900]   And then I wanna use those names from that point on
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.740]   in the counseling session.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.540]   I don't wanna be referring to the wife
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.920]   or the mom or the mother-in-law.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.260]   I want to use the name of the person
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.380]   in the counseling session because that's just a way
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.060]   of expressing care.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.220]   So in note-taking, I'll write down key information like that
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.180]   but I won't be taking copious notes
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.460]   in the counseling session.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.860]   What I'll do is after the counseling session is over,
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:29.860]   I will do detailed notes from what happened in the session.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.980]   But different counselors have different styles on that.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.780]   You'll learn your style.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.780]   That will help you the best.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:39.680]   But that's part of the hard work of listening well.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.380]   They have asking insightful questions,
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:45.080]   keeping the love of Christ central,
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.180]   being wise in the word,
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.700]   demonstrating Christ-like sympathy,
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:56.720]   displaying hope that in a situation that may seem hopeless,
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:02.080]   setting proper expectations,
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.400]   demonstrating dependence on the Lord through prayer,
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.040]   being available while maintaining proper limits.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.040]   You wanna talk through this when you get into phase three
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.880]   of your training, the limits of texting and emailing.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.320]   That's a discussion.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.040]   There's no hard and fast rule on that
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.700]   but that's something that does need to be thought through
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.300]   before you get into formal counseling
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.720]   is how much of texting and emailing and phone calls
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.840]   going to be part of that counseling relationship.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.580]   There really is no one rule on that
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.780]   but it is something you want to set limits on
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:45.440]   and communicate clearly with your counselee.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.480]   And then setting up clear expectations
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.600]   regarding time and duration of meetings.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.240]   Okay, let me get to the last part here
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   with what we've learned here at Kindred.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.720]   And this is just, this isn't from a book,
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.760]   this is just things that have proven to work well
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.960]   in our own ministry, in our own church.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.380]   I'm not gonna say these are genius things
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.360]   but they're just things that have proven
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.140]   to express care for our counselees.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.680]   Number one would be make a commitment
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.920]   to pray for your counselees on a regular basis.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   I mean, we can get so complicated with counseling ministry.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.120]   We can get into all these seminars
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.000]   and read all these books and tapes
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   and just make it more complicated than it ought to be
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   and get back, get away from just doing the biblical basics.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.100]   And the biblical basic is when you counsel someone,
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.240]   make a commitment to pray for them every day.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.560]   Just make that commitment,
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:51.120]   just that I'm gonna engage in intercessory prayer
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.480]   on behalf of my counselee and you will be amazed
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.440]   at how that does change and transform
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.040]   the way you relate to your counselee
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.420]   in the counseling session.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.680]   I remember in a small group meeting,
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.580]   one of the counselors in our ministry,
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.880]   she's also in our small group
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.640]   and she was sharing in the small group,
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.320]   she was saying, I feel so close to you all
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.140]   and fellowship to the members of the small group.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:22.440]   And we were wondering why she felt that way,
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.080]   seeing that we hadn't met in two weeks.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.880]   And she just said, since the last time we met,
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.400]   I've been praying for each of you every day
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.200]   in my prayer life.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.020]   And because of that, I feel so close to you in fellowship.
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.040]   I feel like I'm part of your lives.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.840]   It's just amazing that when you make that simple commitment
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   to pray for your counselees,
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.800]   how that does strengthen your relationship with that person.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.000]   Withholding judgment until you've heard both sides
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.720]   of a conflict, just very practical,
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.120]   especially in a marital counseling situation.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.320]   You want to believe all things.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.040]   Oftentimes you'll hear one side of a marital conflict
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.560]   and you'll just think the worst of the other spouse.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.240]   And when the other spouse comes in
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.200]   and you get them together in counseling,
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.880]   you realize that there are really two sides of the story.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.620]   And so you always want to be on guard,
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.920]   not to prejudge the other person
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.360]   until you have heard the other side of the story.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.400]   Proverbs 18, verse 17,
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.720]   the one who states his case first seems right
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.020]   until the other comes and examines him.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.880]   I can't think of a better way to destroy a relationship
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   with a counselee than to allow an unfair judgmental spirit
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.000]   to enter into the counseling meetings.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.280]   Number three, celebrate each step of obedience
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.340]   in a counselee's life.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.320]   Counseling is like teaching a child to walk.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.200]   Each of my children, we taught them to walk.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.840]   And when they took that first step, we were overjoyed.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.720]   So you did it, you took one step, now take another one.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.040]   And that's how we need to be with our counselees.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.480]   You did it, you did this homework assignment,
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.000]   you went to this service, you read this book.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.600]   I have confidence in you that you can take the next step.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   Learn to celebrate each step in the life of a counselee.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.400]   Number four is be diligent
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.720]   in preparing for the counseling sessions.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.480]   Just little things, showing up on time or showing up early
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.040]   so that you can set up the room and not be hurried.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.080]   Making sure that there's water and coffee and tissues.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.540]   And I've learned that temperature matters
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.200]   in counseling ministry.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.680]   That if you're in a room that's just really stuffy
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.440]   and you're meeting with a counselee for an hour and a half,
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.580]   you're both gonna be falling asleep
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.840]   by the end of that session.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.080]   So just setting the right temperature that's comfortable,
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.160]   that's not too hot and not too cold.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.080]   And doing those little things does make a difference
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.740]   in counseling ministry and just being prepared.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.960]   The counseling session may go a different direction
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.280]   than you had planned, but just preparing for that session
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.680]   is one way of honoring the person
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.860]   that you are ministering to.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.900]   I wanna hit number five
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.040]   and just kind of emphasize this for a moment,
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.400]   but respecting the counselee's comfort level
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.000]   and talking about sensitive issues.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.700]   As I mentioned, I like to ask permission.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:25.200]   I like to make sure, do I have your permission
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.520]   to ask about this area of your life?
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.800]   I don't wanna assume the right
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.360]   to just talk about anything in the counselee's life.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.400]   I want to ask, would it be okay
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.300]   if I asked about this area of your life?
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:48.920]   And to get buy-in and verbal permission to do so.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.860]   I mean, your counseling may have had
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.820]   a really rough family life growing up.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.700]   And before you just barge into that
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.900]   and start asking questions about mom and dad
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.220]   and brother and sister, you just want to ask permission.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:11.580]   Do I have permission to ask you about your family
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.340]   or about your dad?
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.460]   Some of those discussions can get real sensitive
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:18.540]   and you just wanna be aware of that.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:23.200]   And I think that helps to build a caring relationship.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.020]   There are even areas where I will ask our counselee,
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:31.320]   if you're gonna go into that area of life,
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.780]   even to get written permission,
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.600]   just to make it clear that I do have permission
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.680]   to talk about this area of your life
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.300]   and not have any misunderstanding of that.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.940]   So just respecting the counselee's comfort level
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.340]   in talking about sensitive issues.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.160]   I think is another strategy.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.060]   Number six, giving your counselee undistracted attention.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.420]   I think I talked about that.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.240]   That's something that we all need to develop.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.020]   Number seven, learning to say by the grace of God,
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:07.020]   I am what I am and avoiding the spirit of a Pharisee.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:12.020]   Number eight, especially with grieving people,
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.060]   don't be in a hurry to move people past their sorrow.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.180]   I think that's one way of just respecting
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.940]   and caring for our counselees.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:27.480]   There are very few people who request counseling
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.780]   who come in for the first session and say,
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.540]   my problem is I'm just too happy.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:37.260]   But there are many who come in for counseling who say,
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.580]   I'm just really struggling with the sorrows of life.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:43.320]   And I have found in working with people in the church
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.180]   that sometimes Christians, they feel guilty.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.940]   That they're struggling with sorrow
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:53.300]   or experiencing sorrow for a length of time.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.320]   It's almost as if, well, I'm supposed to be a Christian.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.620]   So I should only be sad for one day out of the year
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.460]   and I should really just get over it.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.700]   And I just try to encourage believers
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.460]   whenever I get the chance that Jesus was a man of sorrows
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.160]   and he wept at the grave side of Lazarus.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.940]   He was perfect humanity and yet he was sad.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.140]   He experienced real sorrow.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.340]   So you can experience sorrow and be like Jesus.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.860]   You can weep and it's okay.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:27.660]   You can be like Jesus as you cry tears.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:32.220]   And I've just learned also in counseling ministry,
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.840]   always have tissues.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.220]   You have a counselor who comes in and you just think,
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.820]   well, this person seems strong
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.460]   and we're not gonna need tissues for this session.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.800]   It's a big mistake.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.920]   Always have tissues because people are dealing
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.340]   with the brokenness of this world.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.100]   They're going through heavy times.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.360]   And one of the ways that you care for them
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.300]   is just letting them know it's okay.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.780]   It's okay to grieve.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.320]   It's okay to experience sorrow.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   And we're gonna walk with God through this sorrow together.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.220]   And I'm gonna be patient with you.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.420]   I'm not going to try to rush you through this process.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.620]   And I think that's just one way
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.340]   of developing a caring relationship.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.620]   Ask God to give you emotions where emotions are appropriate,
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:29.380]   whether that's joy or sorrow.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.220]   We could say much more about that,
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.540]   but just there are times in a counseling session
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.720]   where just quick prayer up to the Lord.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.500]   I prayed, Lord, give me the appropriate emotion here.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.040]   I should be feeling joy and I'm not feeling joy.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.700]   Lord, give me joy
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.900]   because my counselee has just experienced a breakthrough
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.940]   or I should be feeling sorrow
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.820]   because my counselee is sharing something very heavy.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.180]   And so Lord, give me the appropriate emotion
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.400]   for this setting.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.060]   As I mentioned, when appropriate,
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:05.700]   be open about sharing your own weaknesses.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:09.040]   Number 11, ask the counselee to pray for you.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.940]   Even the Apostle Paul asked believers to pray for him.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:18.100]   And if Paul needed prayer, then all of us need prayer.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.300]   And we shouldn't be ashamed of asking for that.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.900]   We can say to our counselees, I'm praying for you.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.660]   And will you pray for me that I would have wisdom
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.940]   in guiding this relationship?
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.220]   I've observed some of our counselors
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.920]   and they just do a wonderful job
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.220]   of weaving that into the counseling session.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.680]   Would you pray for me?
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.200]   Because I wanna be the best help to you as I can be.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.540]   We already mentioned number 12,
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:49.420]   being confidential and trustworthy.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.260]   And then number 13, I'll end with this,
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:56.100]   remembering names, remembering names.
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.460]   I think I shared this in some setting.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.780]   I'm not sure if it was in this class,
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.600]   but I used to say, I'm just not good at names.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.300]   I'm not good at learning names.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.340]   And I guess people like to say that.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.540]   And I really wasn't good at learning names.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.600]   And when I studied Romans 16,
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.060]   I was convicted that learning names is an act of love.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.020]   And if the Apostle Paul can learn this entire chapter
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.060]   full of names, and he wasn't even at the church at Rome,
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.920]   then surely I can learn my counselee's name
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.860]   and the names of my counselee's family,
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.780]   friends and neighbors.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:36.620]   And just to, as a discipline, to use their names
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.140]   and to learn their names.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.020]   And I just found that that does help to,
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.940]   it changes the dynamic of the counseling relationship
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.700]   when you're speaking of names and you're saying,
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:50.140]   I'm not just praying for your father or mother,
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.020]   but you're praying for Jack or you're praying for Sally.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.780]   You're using the names.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.500]   That's just a skill that I think communicates care.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.980]   So there you have it.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.040]   Those are like 40 something plus strategies
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.780]   of developing a counseling relationship.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.220]   Of course, the challenge is not only being able
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.860]   to list these, but to actually put these into practice
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.260]   in our own lives.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.120]   So for this essay, pick six.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.100]   What are some of the things that you've heard
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.600]   in this session that would be helpful
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.440]   or challenging to you?
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.820]   Pick six.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.900]   And star them, circle them.
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:30.720]   And for your essay, write six paragraphs.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.300]   Name some scriptural support for each strategy
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.900]   and then talk about how practically
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   that would work out in your life.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.260]   And so I wanna close with this.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.860]   Wayne Mack has said, "Though God sometimes chooses
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.800]   "to accomplish His work through unlikely ways
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.220]   "and unlikely people, the Bible emphasizes
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:53.820]   "that God usually changes lives in a situation
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.980]   "where relationship of concern and trust exists
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.140]   "between the helper and the one who needs help."
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.620]   As biblical counselors, we must do all that we can,
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.460]   and I love this.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.900]   This is what we're aiming for here,
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.300]   to wrap the content of our counseling
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:14.300]   in a package of compassion, respect, and honesty.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:19.020]   And I trust that the Lord will give you grace to do that.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:19.860]   Let me pray for us.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.300]   Father, thank you so much for this look at your word
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.980]   and how it would challenge and instruct our lives.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.260]   And I just pray that this would be true of each of us.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:35.220]   Help us, Lord, to express the character of Christ,
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.260]   who was gentle, lowly, compassionate,
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:44.180]   approachable, welcoming, not pointing the finger
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.180]   of self-righteous judgment, but touching the leper,
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:54.180]   healing the blind man, weeping at the gravesite of Lazarus,
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:12:00.060]   walking among those who were afflicted with sorrow
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.720]   and who were in sin.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.280]   We thank you that Jesus is the mighty friend of sinners.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.040]   He is the wonderful counselor.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.780]   And we pray that if he is the friend of sinners,
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:19.560]   we may learn to be earnest and good friends as well,
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.780]   and that we would wrap this content
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.060]   of the truth of your word
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:30.140]   in a package of Christ-like compassion and care.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.180]   Do this work in each of our hearts.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.340]   Give us, the students here,
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.860]   just a wonderful time of study as they write this essay.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.200]   And bless us all, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.740]   - Amen, well, God bless you.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.020]   If you have any questions, what I'm gonna do
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.760]   is ask you to email me this week,
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.100]   and I'll do my best to get back to you this week.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.820]   And you can also email counseling@kinderchurch.org
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.500]   if you have any questions on admin.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500]   God bless you, have a wonderful.
