[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:56.000]   Cinnamon: Hello everyone. My name is Chris Moody. I was the journalist in Washington DC and in New York. I covered politics for several different outlets and we were living in New York City and I was laid off and that led us to a lot of soul searching and Christy and I decided to give away and sell almost all of our possessions, get rid of our Manhattan penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side and move into a cargo van.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.940]   Sam: A used 2017 Ram Promaster cargo van and we built a tiny home inside the cargo van in one month by ourselves.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:20.340]   So that you guys, some people move into a van because they're broke and they can't afford it. But it sounds like you guys have made the big switch from from the posh, posh part of New York and living in a van down by the river.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.940]   Did it, does this feel a little bit weird or is this just life as normal in today's world?
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.940]   Sam:
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:55.880]   and I think it's a little bit more interesting to see what's going on in the world.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   Sam:
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   I think it's a little bit more interesting to see what's going on in the world.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   Well, Jeff, we kind of saw Chris getting laid off as an opportunity to do something different ourselves and to pursue this passion project, which I've had maybe for about two years. I've been working on this idea of traveling the country and telling stories about people who are choosing to live very intentionally and to opt out of the mainstream, we'd say maybe American dream of having your traditional nine to five job, your house, and more.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   Sam:
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:08.120]   And so we are, you know, living in a van really for the practical reason that it's probably the least expensive way for us to travel the country full time and to live on the road.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.620]   So let's talk about expenses.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.820]   I want to, I want to dig into the van build.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.920]   I want to dig into the comparison of life, but how much would you guess it was cost?
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.520]   Was it costing you to live when you're living in Manhattan?
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.020]   Sam:
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.520]   Yeah, it was.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.820]   I mean, I think it's really, it was, it was, it was a lot of work and I think it was a lot of work.

No one bothered us and it was a free place to stay in the heart of a pretty cool city. So I feel like there's this underworld or this. There's this world of people.

[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:42.380]   the mental health of many of us who are younger, the, some of the objective research data indicates that we're not as confident as we once were.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:50.380]   And I was more advanced when I was growing up as far as more, more experienced with construction projects, things like that.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:55.380]   But I was then, then perhaps you described Chris, but still, it was never a real skill of mine.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.380]   And over the years, I've tried to remedy that and, and build more skill.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.680]   And it's always hard for me because my brain doesn't really work in that physical way.

[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:30.740]  , but I keep going at it because it changes my confidence level.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:30.840]   I used to look at a car engine and not have a clue where to start because although my dad tried to teach me about cars, I didn't pay attention.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:30.940]   And then I said, that's it, I'm going to start fixing some stuff myself.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   And then I learned, wait a second, cars, they're basically the whole skill of fixing a car seems to be diagnosis.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   And I can go and find a manual and they'll say, do this, then do that, then do that.

[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:41.740]   Major component for you is is what you're doing. You're writing you're publishing and you're doing this as a reporting project
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.680]   So tell us about what you have done so far

She and her husband saved a major percentage of their income while they lived in urban centers throughout their 20s. And they've become financially independent in their early 30s. And with that independence, they chose to move to a homestead in rural Vermont, where they live with their family now. And they have the choice of how and when they want to work and how and when they want to spend time with their family. And so we can see that they have a lot of money.

[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:07.360]   You do. And part of the opting out has to be from technology addiction.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:16.660]   Technology is a very powerful thing. It's a wonderful thing. It's connected lots of people. It's changed lives. It's created new economies and new marketplaces.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.180]   It's a wonderful thing. It's connected lots of people. It's changed lives. It's created new economies and new marketplaces.

[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:46.040]  , but it's roped a lot of us in to a point where we're neglecting things that are more important, our families and our communities.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   and there's something about scrolling that part of Twitter or YouTube that makes you mad. Well, that creates endorphins that makes you feel good in a weird strange way. But tell me the truth, Josh.

[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   after the end of an hour of scrolling political Twitter, do you feel really good?
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   and there's something about scrolling that part of Twitter or you feel really good?
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   absolutely not, no question. Of course not, but it affects me big time.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.180]   absolutely not, no question. Of course not, no question. Of course not, but it affects me big time.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:55.760]   Right, but it's not necessarily our fault because these systems are so powerful. They do reel us in, in a way.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.860]   And that includes pretty pictures on Instagram, even that too.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:08.640]   It is addicting and it's important to set up those safeguards just like someone who has another kind of addiction will need to do as well.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.900]   And you're right, being on the road does help, but without those safeguards, I'm the same way and I think many people are.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:14.900]   You just find yourself in the middle of the road and you're like, "Oh, I'm not going to do this."
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:14.900]   You're right, being on the road does help, but without those safeguards, I'm the same way and I think many people are.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:44.940]  , and I think many people are. You just find yourself roped back in.

[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:30.060]   My community, the radicals here who are part of Radical Personal Finance, can help you to discover some cool new stories that you can use in the book that you're writing and the projects that you're working on about people who have opted out.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:35.140]   Because I know of, I've got, there are some amazing people in the audience here.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:45.020]   So who would you like to connect with and what kinds of stories would you like to be able to hear and to profile that will help you with the project that you're working on?
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   'Cause I'm just a sort of a person.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   I'm just a sort of a person.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   It's really important to have a strong relationship with your community and your friends and your family.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   And I think that's really important, but without those safeguards, I'm not really helping you do as well.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   So I think that's really important, but without those safeguards, I'm just find yourself roped back in.
