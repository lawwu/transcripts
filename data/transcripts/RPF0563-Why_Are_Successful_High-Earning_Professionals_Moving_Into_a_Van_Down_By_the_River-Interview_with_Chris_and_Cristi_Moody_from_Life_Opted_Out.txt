[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.720]   My name is Joshua and today on Radical Personal Finance, I'm excited to bring you an interview
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.060]   with Chris and Christy Moody, who are embarking on a project called Life Opted Out.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.840]   This interview features two themes.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.160]   Number one, it's their personal story of packing up all of their possessions, moving out of
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.080]   a penthouse apartment in Manhattan and moving into a cargo van, traveling around the country.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.540]   But it's also an interview project where they are looking for interesting stories and trying
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.980]   to examine the threads that are happening in US American culture right now, where many
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.440]   people have chosen and are choosing to opt out of the more traditional path.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.980]   I hope you enjoy this interview.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.200]   It's an excellent project.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.360]   Stay tuned to the end of the interview for two things.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.160]   Number one, my hope is that you, a radical, can help Chris and Christy with their reporting
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.900]   project because their project is a perfect fit and it dovetails nicely in with Radical
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   Personal Finance.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.280]   And I want you to help them by providing for them some interesting stories and interesting
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.000]   research that they can do in possibly with you or with people that you know and that
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280]   you know of.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.000]   The second thing is stay tuned at the end for a little bit of closing commentary by
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.640]   me on what I am observing in what Chris and Christy are doing.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.720]   Chris and Christy Moody, welcome to the show.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.720]   Great to be here, Josh.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   Hey, Josh.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.960]   So I'm really excited to bring you guys on today because this project that you are engaged
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.300]   in is a perfect fit for the Radical Personal Finance community.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.080]   It's a perfect fit in terms of interesting content and also we as a community want to
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.320]   help you with your project.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.760]   So describe who you are and what you're doing at this stage of your life.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.240]   Well, Josh, my name is Chris Moody.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.480]   I was a journalist in Washington, D.C. and in New York.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.200]   I covered politics for several different outlets.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.280]   And we were living in New York City and I was laid off and that led us to a lot of soul
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.840]   searching and Christy and I decided to give away and sell almost all of our possessions,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.760]   get rid of our Manhattan penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side and move into a cargo
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.040]   van, a used 2017 Ram ProMaster cargo van.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.280]   And we built a tiny home inside the cargo van in one month by ourselves.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.640]   So that you guys, some people move into a van because they're broke and they can't afford
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.160]   it but it sounds like you guys have made the big switch from the posh part of New York
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.280]   and to be living in a van down by the river.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.480]   Does this feel a little bit weird or is this just life as normal in today's world?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.280]   Well, Josh, we kind of saw Chris getting laid off as an opportunity to do something different
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.200]   ourselves and to pursue this passion project, which I've had maybe for about two years.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.800]   I've been working on this idea of traveling the country and telling stories about people
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.600]   who are choosing to live very intentionally and to opt out of the mainstream, we'd say
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.400]   maybe American dream of having your traditional nine to five job, your house and mortgage,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.320]   your debts, your house and garage just full of stuff.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.040]   And so we are living in a van really for the practical reason that it's probably the least
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.240]   expensive way for us to travel the country full time and to live on the road.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.080]   So let's talk about expenses because I want to dig into the van build.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.240]   I want to dig into the comparison of life.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.160]   But how much would you guess it was costing you to live when you're living in Manhattan
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.400]   and how much is it costing you to live now?
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.480]   I'd have to take a look at the spreadsheets we had, but I know it was costing more than
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.960]   $5,000 a month just to live and that doesn't even include student loans and other kind
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.720]   of expenses.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.960]   Given the cost of rent up in New York City, food, transportation, everything.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.920]   We were living just in a one bedroom, a pretty standard New York apartment, nothing too big
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   or anything.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.960]   Nothing is big up there really.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.520]   But with the van, we were able to do the entire build out for about $5,000.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.920]   So we really saved a lot of money on a monthly basis.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   And then the van plus the cost of the van, so we're financing that at around $1,000 a
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.440]   month and all told, it is far less than living in New York City.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.560]   Also when you're living in a van, the simplicity of everything that you do really brings your
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.680]   cost down, especially with cooking.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.000]   We use a one burner stove and that makes for a lot of vegan bowls and lentils and rice
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.140]   and vegetables and things that really don't cost a lot of money.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.480]   So add the rising cost of gas to that which made it a little bit more expensive, but we're
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.680]   talking a pretty significant reduction in expenses.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.160]   How long have you been on the road now?
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.880]   We left the beginning of June.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.480]   So we've been on for about six weeks now.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.560]   And are you paying for camping and campgrounds?
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.480]   Are you parking in random parking lots?
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.880]   How are you handling where you stay?
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.640]   So we rarely pay for a campground unless we're at a national park and we feel like it's worth
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.240]   it to pay to be inside the national park and at their campground.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.280]   Usually we stay with this program called Harvest Host, which is an excellent program.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:02.820]   If you have a self-contained RV vehicle, an RV or like ours, a class B RV, you can stay
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.680]   on these farms, vineyards, historic sites, all different kinds of places all over the
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.360]   country for a yearly subscription.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.640]   I think we paid maybe 45 or $48 for the year.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.320]   And you just call up the various farms, ask if you can stay the night.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.720]   We're usually staying in a cow field or in a back parking lot behind a barn or whatever
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.880]   space they have.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.660]   If it's like a winery, sometimes in the actual parking lot of the winery.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.740]   And it's been great.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.500]   It's basically been completely free.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.600]   And we always have a place to stay where we have permission and people know we're there.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   We get to talk to the farmers, we get to meet people.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.900]   It's been a really great program.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.980]   And that program, Josh, has taken probably one of the most significant anxiety inducers
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.240]   out of van life.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   And that is wondering where we're going to stay.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.260]   And when we're asleep, is anyone going to knock on the door?
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.240]   There's nothing more terrifying I've heard because it hasn't happened to us yet.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.800]   But there's nothing more terrifying than an unknown person knocking on your metal van
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   door.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.880]   You don't know if it's a police officer or something more nefarious.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.320]   And so staying on these farms and vineyards has just been so wonderful.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.440]   We highly recommend this program called Harvest Hosts to anyone who has a self-contained RV.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.960]   But there's a lot of places people can stay when they're living on the road.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.760]   Of course, there are campgrounds where you can pay.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   National Forests has free camping across the United States.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.880]   And then there's also just boondocking in a city on the sidewalk.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.680]   We not on the sidewalk, on the street parking.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.640]   We slept in downtown Washington, D.C., kind of in the shadow of the Supreme Court and
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.560]   just woke up in the morning and drove off.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.640]   No one bothered us.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.680]   And it was a free place to stay in the heart of a pretty cool city.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.720]   So I feel like there's this underworld or there's this world of people who are doing
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.200]   what you're doing that most people don't notice.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.360]   But once you get tuned into the signs, my wife and I, I point them out to her and now
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.800]   she points them out to me.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.640]   I always say, "Oh, look, there's a van dweller.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.720]   Oh, look, there's somebody living in their car."
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.840]   Once you get tuned into the signs, I think you see them in a lot of places.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   I think you see people doing what you're doing if you know what to look for.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.240]   Has that been your experience?
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.600]   When we were still in Manhattan, we noticed on our block a van where someone was living
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.960]   in the van.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.920]   And so you look for the signs of if they have solar panels, if they have a ventilation fan,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.960]   if the windows are open, have screens on them.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.800]   And so we've seen it even in New York City, people living on the streets.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:40.400]   And I want to say to the listeners, the kind of van we're in is just a worker's cargo van.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.680]   It kind of looks like a plumber's van or something like that.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   It's not marked.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.280]   It's just a regular white van.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.800]   And stealth for people that are living full time in these things is very important because
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.440]   it gives you a lot more options.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.120]   And that's why we chose to go with just a cargo van instead of maybe a larger RV.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.520]   Christy and I don't have any children, so that makes it a little bit easier for just
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.720]   the two of us, even though it is just 72 square feet.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.080]   It is a tiny space that we're in together.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.680]   But yes, you walk around and you notice all the little things.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   And there are people, if you go on Instagram, you look for #vanlife, you'll find several
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   different ways of living in vans.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.440]   We're kind of at this wonderful cultural moment right now where the technology is such that
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.760]   people can go on the road and work from the road.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.280]   They don't have to be stuck in one place if they don't want to be.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   I think it's tremendous what you and your family, Josh, have been doing.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.640]   You have children and you're on the road and you're working.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:44.080]   This is not something that would be entirely possible, at least on such a widespread level,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.320]   only a few years ago.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   And now it is.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.520]   And that's part of what really took us to the road, was to find this underworld that
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.400]   you're talking about and hear their stories and learn about them and find out why they
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:04.280]   left maybe a comfortable suburban life and are now living on the road.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.960]   We are meeting some amazing people.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.880]   And that's what fascinates me about your project because you're not just doing it for fun.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.000]   You're doing this for fun, for the adventure of it, for the change in your life.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.560]   But you're also doing it as a reporting project.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.640]   And one of the things I'm intrigued to ask you about now and also to learn as you continue
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.000]   your reporting project is the change that's happening in terms of culture.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.320]   The first van dweller that I ever met was a guy named Fred.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:38.200]   And Fred was this older guy, overweight, long stringy hair, probably, I assume, an aging
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   hippie.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.040]   And he had this old broken down Dodge cart conversion van that he slept in.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.160]   And it was packed with junk.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   And I had a friend of mine who had an acre and a quarter in his house.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.360]   And somehow he had come in contact with Fred.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.480]   And Fred had permission to park his van overnight on my friend's property.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.720]   But it was just under a pine tree in a sort of semi-suburban lot.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.160]   And I would look at Fred and I never really talked to him much.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:12.040]   But he almost looked like the stereotypical broken down older guy with just junk everywhere.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   It was a very dirty and disheveled appearance.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.520]   It just didn't seem like anything attractive.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:24.360]   Now fast forward to today, you guys are not dirty and disheveled.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   And I-
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   Most of the time.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.400]   Most of the time, indeed.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.320]   But I mean, you guys are professionals.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.600]   Chris you are an experienced attorney.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.960]   Sorry, Chris, you're an experienced reporter.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.120]   You've done all kinds of appearances on TV.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.280]   And Christy, you're an attorney.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.880]   And you guys are highly educated, affluent, upper middle, upper class elite type of culture.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.240]   And yet this is van life.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.200]   And I'm wondering if there is a change.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   If this is-
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.640]   And if so, why?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.480]   Why are people like you doing something that used to be you would have to be a dirty aging
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.840]   hippie to do?
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.720]   I think there's a lot of answers to that question.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.520]   For us personally, apart from the fact that this is the cheapest and most efficient way
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.080]   for us to travel with all of our possessions across the country and interview people for
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:25.120]   this project, for us it's really stepping into a completely different type of life.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.400]   Like Chris said, we got rid of almost all of our possessions.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.560]   We're living in 72 square feet, which is 12 by six by six.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   We have to be very careful about our water consumption because we provide our own water
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:48.040]   because we have a completely self-contained water system where we have to go to a campground
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.760]   or a gas station or something and fill up our water bottles.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.820]   We have to monitor our electricity.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.120]   And so we're thinking about electricity.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.640]   We have to dispose of all of our trash.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.200]   We're not at campgrounds.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.600]   There's no dumpsters to put our trash in.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:08.240]   And so this has been, first of all, learning what things we can live with, what things
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.640]   we can live without, and what things we can be self-sustaining in, like our electricity,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.840]   our water, feeding ourselves, finding places to stay every night.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.600]   But sorry, I lost my train of thought.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.160]   Well, I think Josh, to your question, I think it all comes down to one of the great lies
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.800]   in American culture, and that is if you have things and you have a house and you buy more
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.480]   things than your neighbor, you will be happy.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.720]   And these things will make you happy.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.200]   And the house in the suburbs will make you happy and the fancy job.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.360]   And we're at this moment right now, I think, Josh, where people are realizing that that
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.200]   is not making them as happy as they were told their whole lives it would.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.960]   And they're searching for something a little bit more, something more fulfilling, and realizing
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.880]   they don't need all of these things in order to live the life that they were promised when
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.800]   they took out that big loan to go to school and spent all of that time acquiring things.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.600]   And we're at the nexus right now where people are realizing that, and the technology and
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.680]   the price have come to a place where a lot of people can do it.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.240]   And that was not the case many years ago.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.960]   It was really people on the far fringes years ago that were doing this, because it was extreme.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.480]   It was even harder.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.240]   But now, with technology, the ability to find places to stay, the ability to connect with
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.800]   other people that are living this lifestyle, it broadens it to a lot more people so that
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.200]   somebody who's just not feeling very fulfilled in life and realizing that maybe they got
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.240]   hoodwinked can actually take something like this on.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.320]   And I think that nexus in time and technology and affordability is what's causing this right
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.320]   now.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.880]   Do you ever feel, have you felt, or have you felt a little guilty about...
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:05.400]   I just sometimes think of how hard many of our forebearers worked to build the good life,
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.560]   to work hard, to build shelter and to provide income and to provide a stable home base.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:19.080]   And I sometimes wonder if we who are younger, who tend to be vocally despising of some of
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.640]   those things, I wonder if we should feel guilty for that.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.960]   It almost feels a little strange to know that the things that other people worked so hard
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.920]   for, we have such abundance that we just walk away from them.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.880]   And I'll give an example.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:42.400]   A few years ago, I visited a small museum in a little dusty town in Wyoming where my
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.880]   grandmother lives.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.360]   And it showed the...
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.160]   The house was preserved as it was, and it was a wealthy person in town's house.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.920]   And it had the horsehair sofa that was positioned in the parlor.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:01.320]   And I was looking at this horsehair sofa, and there was a little sign and a plaque talking
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.560]   about how much it cost and how expensive it was.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.960]   And it was a very beautiful chair.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:13.360]   And in looking at it, I was imagining how nice it would have been for that family who
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.320]   had that piece of furniture shipped from the East Coast all the way out to Wyoming and
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:25.120]   had it in their house as something that was beautiful and nice and comfortable and luxurious.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.300]   And they were in a very austere environment.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.040]   And how that was a status symbol that had real meaning, and it was very satisfying for
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   them.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.440]   Meanwhile, I'm just thinking about the dumpster, the dumpsters and the sides of the road where
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.200]   I live, and recognizing how nowadays we just toss these things out left and right, and
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.280]   it has no meaning.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.640]   I guess my question doesn't really have a point.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:54.120]   It just seems weird and hard to grapple with in terms of the sheer physical material abundance
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.300]   that we have.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.960]   And now the next step seems to be that we just walk away from it and get rid of all
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.640]   of our nice stuff and move into a small van or an RV.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.920]   I sometimes wonder what our grandparents would say.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.560]   I think your question has a great point, Josh.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.280]   Let's face some facts.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:19.760]   One is that we live in an incredibly privileged time and an incredibly privileged place.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.960]   And this kind of living in a van does come from a place of privilege.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.120]   There are a lot of people who do it because there's nowhere else to go.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.800]   And that, I think, is a different thing.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.040]   I think it's important for us to really recognize the privilege that we have in this
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.000]   opportunity to do this.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.720]   But you're totally right.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   You go far back enough, anyone in our families were living very different lives and hoping
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.240]   and dreaming of very different futures.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.880]   But I think every generation gets the right to define what makes them happy and what their
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.000]   goals are.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.040]   And there's a lot of systems that have been set up by the previous generations that worked
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.680]   for them.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.320]   And I think it's our right to redefine those systems if we want to and explore maybe what
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.000]   went wrong and what we can do better and whether those systems are fulfilling and right for
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.560]   us and our future generations.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:25.080]   I know Christy's family came from Cuba as refugees and worked very hard to get back
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.840]   on their feet as non-English speaking Americans, learning the language, getting an education,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.520]   and trying to thrive in their own businesses.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.200]   And now their daughter says she's moving into a van and it probably sounded pretty
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.360]   crazy to her parents when we told them, even though they did help us build it in their
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.440]   front yard.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.600]   But I think you make a great point about that.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   But still, even if some of those systems, those systems are not perfect that were built
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.880]   by the baby boomers and built by the generation before them.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.160]   And I think it's a sign of progress to be trying to redefine how we live our lives and
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.840]   noticing the things that we're told should make us happy and going, "You know what?
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.920]   I don't need that."
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.560]   And I think it really gets us back to something a lot more simple and something a lot more
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   satisfying.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.520]   - Yeah, I think this quest for happiness, I've been thinking a lot about it recently
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:28.240]   in terms of the, there's almost this social angst where people feel as though if they
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.600]   are unhappy that there's something wrong with them.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.440]   And there's this quest for happiness that people are trying to pursue in many different
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   ways.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.720]   And it's not all bad in my opinion, but it's not necessarily all good.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:46.360]   I think there's more to it than just meaning, which is why, there's more to life than just
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.720]   this desire for happiness or hedonistic self-indulgence.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:55.680]   And I think that to me is one of the things that people are looking for, whether they
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.160]   would put those labels on it or not.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.560]   So with your report, go ahead.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.840]   - Our culture and our economy is set up to make sure that you're unhappy most of the
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.200]   time because if you're perfectly satisfied and happy, you don't need to buy anything.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:16.100]   And they need you to continue to buy things even though you might not need a new couch,
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.900]   they make you feel like you do.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:25.480]   And that feeling of lacking, that you don't have what it takes unless you buy this thing,
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.240]   that's something that permeates within our culture.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.640]   And I'll say that capitalism has helped create one of the most abundant or the most abundant
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.920]   and privileged societies of all time, but there are strings attached.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.720]   And that is a kind of a constant feeling that you're unsatisfied because people who have
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.640]   a great interest in making money off of you need you to feel a little unsatisfied.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.040]   - Yeah, the premise of our project is sort of that the American dream and the pursuit
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:03.000]   of happiness in the pursuit of material things and material success has failed a lot of people.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.520]   And especially a lot of people in our generation are starting to question whether those things
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.880]   and that material success is actually the key to happiness in life.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.200]   I know for me personally, I spent a long time in my 20s when I was a practicing attorney
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:25.800]   and very unhappy, trying to find happiness and trying to figure out why am I unhappy
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:32.000]   everything is great, life is wonderful, we have all these things and just continually
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.100]   finding that I wasn't as happy as I thought I should be.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:43.000]   And I think as you grow up, when you get older, you start to realize like life is not about
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.680]   me and my feelings and not about my trying to like achieve this level of happiness that
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:57.640]   I think I should have, but rather life is about other people, what we do with our time
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:04.800]   that matters, our families, the good things that we are putting into the world.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.660]   And that's something that we're really kind of pursuing and seeking out as we do this
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.820]   project as well.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:19.040]   Part of our project is, we have nowhere to be, we don't have to be interviewing people
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.280]   if we don't want to, we can go anywhere and do anything.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:30.200]   And so when you have absolute freedom, what kind of values and what kind of disciplines
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.700]   do you want to instill in your life?
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.300]   And so for us, we're really like trying to figure out like, okay, when you're traveling
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.560]   every day, when you're going to all these beautiful places, when you're talking to all
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.640]   these interesting people, how do you figure out how to have some quiet time in the morning
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.200]   where you read and meditate and contemplate things?
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.000]   And how do you make time to write and do the things you're supposed to do for your projects?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.040]   And how do you make time for exercise and eating healthy and all that when we could
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.200]   do absolutely anything and stay at vineyards every night and drink and eat cheese every
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.680]   night if we wanted to?
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.560]   Yeah, my wife and I are experiencing the same challenge.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.760]   It's interesting when you remove some of the constraints, I don't think often people who
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.120]   are very constrained seem to feel that if you would just remove the constraints, everything
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.240]   would be wonderful and they would be happy.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.360]   But I've learned that absence of constraints does not equal happiness.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.900]   Actually that's a structure, a discipline, a schedule, a system.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.200]   Those things really help, that structured approach to life really, really helps.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.400]   I used to despise working a nine to five job, Monday through Friday.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.280]   I don't want to work this job.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.040]   Well now in hindsight I recognize that hey, the nine to five, Monday through Friday type
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.640]   of work, it really helps.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.040]   And I try to work on a Monday through Friday, nine to five schedule myself because it's
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.200]   good for my productivity and it's good for my mental health.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.840]   So I'll be interested to hear how your habits develop and what you find.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.160]   What have you found so far?
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.200]   How much structure has been helpful to you?
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Well I think it's really important Josh to make sure you know what your priorities
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   are.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.320]   And for us it's time spent present with one another that's undistracted.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.760]   So we try to make sure that there are technologies that are distracting put away at times when
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.320]   we need to be together.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.720]   In the morning, knowing each person's role because everything is a chore when you live
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   in a van.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.120]   Nothing is automatic.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.640]   So I'm in charge of water and I have to make sure that there's always water in our system.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.540]   We carry a hundred liters at full capacity and that goes quicker than you think.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.120]   Or making breakfast, making coffee, making lunch throughout the day.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.460]   Making sure that we have set aside time that we can read in the morning and take a quiet
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.880]   time with one another.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.600]   And then also one practice that we've been trying to stay to keep doing is hiking each
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.820]   day.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:10.440]   The level of I guess positive things that come from that we found is just so abundant
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.400]   and it's important to do that.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:18.760]   Because like Christy kind of hinted at, you could just do nothing all day.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.420]   You could just drive all day and without that structure that you put on yourself you could
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.640]   really find yourself in a rut.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:32.560]   Prior to your van life, I know Chris you were very busy working as a reporter in the Manhattan
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.480]   national, international news media scene.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.080]   And Christy very busy in that Manhattan life as well.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:47.520]   I can't think of a bigger contrast to go from busy, fast-paced downtown New York City to
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.960]   what you've just described.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.880]   How has that affected your relationship?
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.620]   Well, you know, that's actually interesting Josh.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.760]   When we moved to New York City, Chris and I made some big life changes.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.680]   When we moved from Washington DC.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.240]   Yeah, when we moved from Washington DC to New York City, Chris and I made some big life
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:13.780]   changes and we decided to be very disciplined in how we spent our time together.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.780]   So when Chris came home from work, we have like a basket next to the front door where
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.220]   he puts his cell phone, I put my cell phone.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.240]   Everyone leaves their cell phones in that basket.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.000]   And we spend time together, we spend time reading, we spend time listening to audio
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.120]   books, going on walks, going to museums and the parks.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:38.880]   And so we've kind of started those sort of disciplines before we moved into the van.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:45.840]   And so they've kind of continued into our van life, which is good.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.360]   But let's say that van life is a huge adjustment.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.840]   So the first week I would say was pretty difficult, Josh.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.640]   It didn't help that it was cold, it was raining, and Christy had kind of thrown at her back
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   a little bit.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.160]   And that required me to do just about everything.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.020]   And Christy likes to have things done a certain way.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:14.800]   And if she can't do them, she has to communicate it to me and I do everything pretty poorly.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.560]   So things like not understanding the systems of the van quite well enough to do them smoothly.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   For example, we have to build our bed every night.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.200]   We have kind of a couch system and then the bedding is underneath in a storage area and
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.960]   then there's a central thing that we put across the top that makes it into like a queen-size
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   bed.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.080]   But you have to put that together at night and you have to take it down in the morning.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.640]   And if it's raining outside, you're both in the van, it's 72 square feet, you're running
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.100]   into each other.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.720]   You have to learn to be patient.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.040]   You have to learn to communicate and you have to learn grace.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:57.400]   Because you can just rack up offenses all day long and unless you're able to forgive
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.080]   and to take a deep breath, it's going to be really difficult.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.640]   The van life is not for everyone.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.040]   As I think any listener will attest that they wouldn't want to live in something so small.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.480]   They wouldn't want the extra chores of having to haul your own water like you live out in
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.900]   the woods or something.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:18.080]   But I find great value in both the communication that we're able, the communication skills
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:24.980]   we're able to develop together as a couple and also what manual and physical labor does
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.420]   for your body and your mind.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   It makes you grateful.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.200]   It makes you realize where things come from.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.400]   And I think there's something that is lost when physical labor is taken out of our lives,
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.360]   which it was for me for so many years.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:44.440]   And now that it's back, Josh, in the build of the van, which it took us one month to
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:50.360]   do every day, about eight to 10 hours a day, I learned physical labor for the first time
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.200]   because I'm just a suburban kid that never worked a day in his life in any real sense.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.560]   And I loved it.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.640]   And I was very surprised to find that about myself.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.040]   I'm convinced that...
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.840]   Go ahead, Christy.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.600]   As far as the relationship goes, I would say, as Chris said, the first week was incredibly
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   difficult.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.360]   One of the most difficult probably weeks of our five-year marriage so far.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.400]   Josh, let me just say, I didn't realize that.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:29.120]   But I will say, living in a van and basically having to do everything ourselves and figure
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.040]   out these systems to make things a little bit easier and make things work really does
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.960]   add to this level of teamwork that may be in a more automatic lifestyle where you have
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.360]   regular running water and regular electricity and all these things that just happen kind
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.680]   of automatically.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   I found that it's really helped us to become a team and rely on each other much more than
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.920]   we were before.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.820]   Before I would do certain things and Chris would do certain things, but they were kind
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.120]   of in their own realms and separate.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.840]   And now we have to work together as a team every single day to do things that we couldn't
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.240]   do just on our own.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.720]   Has taking responsibility for your living conditions in such a physical way impacted
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.240]   your confidence in any way?
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:31.440]   So I'd never used a power tool before I built my own house a couple months ago.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.400]   And I was never able to do anything.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.920]   I grew up in a way where I never gave myself the patience to do anything that was that
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.000]   difficult because we live in a very automatic society where if something doesn't work,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.480]   you throw it away, you buy a new one or you pay somebody to fix it.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.920]   That is how I grew up.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.360]   In our house, if something was too frustrating or took too long, we would just drop it and
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   go get ice cream.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.560]   I mean, that was just the way it was.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.360]   And when you build your own house, nothing is going to come together automatically.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.280]   You must look at a challenge and figure out how to get over that mountain.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.680]   You must build the thing or else you're not going to have a house.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.840]   And I remember, Josh, there were nights after a long day's work and we hadn't figured
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.200]   out some problem, whether it was with the electrical or how to design the bed or the
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   kitchen.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.600]   I was thinking, "How are we going to do this?"
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.360]   And then the next morning, we'd get ourselves a fresh pot of coffee and a good night's
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.600]   sleep, and we'd figure it out.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:35.840]   And doing that repeated over and over and over, yes, tremendously built confidence.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:42.280]   Now after doing this, we feel like with enough help from YouTube and from communities on
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.400]   social media and some practice, we can do just about anything.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.640]   We're talking about building a real house someday.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.880]   It's like, "Oh, well, a house is a rectangle.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.520]   That's easy because our van is more like a tube.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.160]   You have to build around the circle and overcome all those challenges.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.960]   But we can build anything in a rectangle."
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.360]   And I never in my wildest dreams would have ever thought that I could maybe do something
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:09.840]   as even simple as insulating a house or, gosh, installing something or building something
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.480]   with wood and using carpentry.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.080]   I had no idea that you can do it.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.840]   And I'm coming at it from the most ignorant, the least skilled person.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.320]   And with a little bit of help, we did it.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.640]   And so yes, if you do a big project like this, especially with your wife, you will learn
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.920]   a lot about your relationship and also feel pretty confident that you can take challenges
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   in the future.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.480]   Christy, what was your experience?
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:44.560]   Because you also came from more of the academic world, but you were doing this, in my understanding,
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.080]   you were one of the major designers in this project.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.400]   What was your experience?
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:56.560]   Yeah, I did design the entire project and the entire van, which was not easy.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:02.880]   So I do come from an academic background and research is something that I'm very good at.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:09.080]   Like Chris said, so we decided to do this in February.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.960]   We took the month of March basically to figure out which van we were going to buy, which
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:20.560]   type of van we're going to buy, and for me to actually do the design of where the beds
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.080]   would be, how the bed and seating system would work, what kind of kitchen we wanted, refrigerator,
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.840]   electricity, etc.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.480]   And then we planned for a month basically, and then built for a month.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.440]   And I don't recommend by any means building out your entire van in a month.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.600]   But we just had a time crunch and we had to do it.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.400]   And so it was really tough.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.120]   We were doing it in my parents' front yard in Florida.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.400]   And my dad is wonderful.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:34:01.360]   He helped us a lot, but I had to conceptualize the entire van and every step that we were
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:08.000]   going to take, and then kind of direct Chris and my dad and buy all the things on Amazon
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.200]   or at Home Depot, whatever we needed in order to do the things we needed to do that day.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:18.280]   And so I guess I kind of designed and was the project manager for the entire van build.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.680]   And I mean, it does really give you a lot of confidence to say like, "Okay, we have
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.800]   these problems.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.920]   We have to figure it out.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.080]   There's no one else who could do it for us.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.300]   And it has to be done today because we need to do something else tomorrow because we need
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.440]   to finish this thing."
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.160]   So it was, as anyone who works with their parents occasionally knows, it was difficult
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:48.760]   at times working with my dad, who is very handy, but sometimes a little bit stubborn.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.880]   But we did it.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.480]   I think we feel really like we have gained this confidence and these skills that are
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:03.120]   really going to keep on providing new opportunities throughout our lives.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.200]   I look at things sometimes now, and I think Chris does too.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.840]   He looks at a wooden fence and he's like, "I could build that."
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.440]   Or I look at a table and I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to build...
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.080]   Next time we live in a house, I'm going to build my own table and chairs."
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.000]   Never would have thought that before.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.400]   Having that kind of confidence just to say like, "Yeah, sure.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   We could figure that out.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   That's not a big deal."
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.600]   It's really wonderful.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.560]   Something Chris and I have been thinking about and talking about, and maybe something we're
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:34.680]   going to think about and develop in our project is we feel like we live in this culture of
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.980]   constant convenience.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.480]   So you need something and you just go on Amazon and you look for it and you get it.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:48.160]   You get that exact specific thing that you need in order to meet your very specific first
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.760]   world need.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:56.080]   And we found in the van build, it takes a lot of improvising, a lot of compromising,
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:03.760]   a lot of just trying to make things that were not meant to be a fixture in a van, part of
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   a van.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:11.160]   And so that skill of also just learning how to improvise and learning to make things work
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:18.000]   is super important in a van life, especially when now we don't have access to Amazon's
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.520]   next day delivery any longer.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.700]   Because we're always traveling, we have to just figure out how to make things work.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:30.540]   If something breaks on the road, we have to go to a Home Depot or Walmart and find whatever
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.780]   piece might relatively work in that situation.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.980]   If we hadn't have done the van build ourselves, if something happened on the road, we would
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.080]   be really lost.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.100]   And now we feel like we can do just about anything.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.780]   Yeah, I think that's also one of the most important parts of building the van yourself.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.100]   Chris and I know where all the electrical wires are behind the walls.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:56.100]   If something in the electricity gets messed up, we can open up the wall, we can fix it.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.560]   We know how all the plumbing works in the van.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.300]   We know where all the screws and all the nuts and bolts are in the van.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.660]   And so if something goes wrong, we know how to take it apart and how to put it back together
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.820]   and how we can figure out how to fix it.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.420]   And that really gives us a lot of confidence on the road as well.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:18.980]   I think back to the major theme of your work as far as what's going on in this generational
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.620]   change.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:27.340]   To me, this story that you're describing of confidence is a major key to the component
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.740]   of people being confident themselves and being happy.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:37.860]   In our modern world, we are often so specialized that the only thing we know how to do is a
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.660]   very specialized job that creates income.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:46.740]   And we provide for most of our basic needs exclusively through the – I was going to
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.180]   say through writing checks, but more through the swiping of cards or the transferring of
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.500]   digital money.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.180]   And so if something happens and something goes wrong, we have to transfer digital money.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:02.220]   And then if there's a problem in that, it leads to this – I think often leads to this
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.260]   sense of helplessness.
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:09.500]   And the mental health of many of us who are younger, some of the objective research data
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.900]   indicates that we're not as confident as we once were.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:18.740]   And I was more advanced when I was growing up as far as more experienced with construction
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.780]   projects, things like that, than perhaps you described, Chris.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.620]   But still, it was never a real skill of mine.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.580]   And over the years, I've tried to remedy that and build more skill.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:35.420]   It's always hard for me because my brain doesn't really work in that physical way.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.540]   But I keep going at it because it changes my confidence level.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.000]   I used to look at a car engine and not have a clue where to start because although my
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.980]   dad tried to teach me about cars, I didn't pay attention.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.500]   And then I said, "That's it.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.380]   I'm going to start fixing some stuff myself."
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.980]   And then I learned, "Wait a second.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:55.780]   There's basically the whole skill of fixing a car seems to be diagnosis.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.660]   And I can go and find a manual and they'll say, 'Do this, then do that, then do that.'"
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.620]   And I probably could get a little closer to figuring out the problem.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.740]   And then it's just usually a matter of bolting and unbolting some parts.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.460]   And as I started to fix more things on my car, it built my confidence where I wasn't
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.660]   so intimidated by a broken car.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:20.660]   And same thing for me as I've worked on my RV and on my house, I've developed more confidence.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:26.340]   And that confidence in your ability to provide for your needs, the ability to provide your
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.820]   shelter, the ability to provide your food to some degree, the ability to provide entertainment
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.860]   for yourself, the ability to take care of your waste, that really changes something.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:43.840]   There's something very human about that that all of our ancestors knew.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:50.300]   And there's something very new about the last, say, half century, I think, half century to
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.780]   century, where we've lost touch with many of those basic things.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:00.340]   And it's very hard to feel like you could just walk away from thousands and thousands
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.700]   of years of human experience into this modern brave new world and not lose something.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.300]   And I'm convinced, just kind of providing my little suggestion for your reporting project,
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:16.660]   I'm convinced that's a core thing in our human experience that we need to make sure that
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.420]   we always cultivate.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:26.300]   Well I think it speaks to why so many millennials are getting into craft industries, craft brewing,
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.900]   craft all kinds of stuff, you know, carpentry.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:36.340]   We grew up in, for a lot of us, the last part of the 20th century when everything was just
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.100]   taken care of for us and we want to find out how things work ourselves.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:46.020]   And I'm not some kind of doomsday person or anything, but I think it's important to know
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.140]   how your systems work and know what you're going to do if something bad does happen in
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.260]   any kind of varying degree.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.940]   And I feel like a different person being on the other side of this.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.220]   And we're only 5,000 miles into our journey and there's a lot more time to go.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.540]   And I'm also grateful that after 5,000 miles, nothing has broken, so we built something
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.540]   at least semi-properly.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.300]   But I think you really hit it on the head there, Josh.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:20.180]   Yeah, and for us this is also a really pretty personal journey to try to figure out how
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:25.420]   we want to live and what kind of lifestyle we want to have.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:31.420]   Obviously we've lived in urban centers for the last decade and we really enjoyed that
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.300]   and that was a great life.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.380]   But we don't know going forward what kind of lives we want to live.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.820]   If we want to live on a farm or if we want to live back in Manhattan, we have no idea.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.300]   And so part of this journey is also for us to try to figure out what is the good life
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:52.540]   for us and what kind of life would provide the best kind of opportunities and the best
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.660]   lifestyle for the future family we hope to have.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:01.060]   So let's transition to your reporting project because I know this is a major component in
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.100]   addition to the personal inquiry that you just described.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.740]   A major component for you is what you're doing.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.980]   You're writing, you're publishing and you're doing this as a reporting project.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.900]   So tell us about what you have done so far, who have you spoken with and what have you
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.540]   learned so far in terms of your cultural analysis regarding people who are choosing to live
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.540]   a different life?
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.300]   Well, we are looking for people that have not only opted out of conventional ways of
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.180]   doing things but are trying something new and really thriving.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:38.020]   I think my entrance point for it was the personal finance community, the FIRE community, Financial
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.660]   Independence Retire Early, as your listeners know so much about.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.060]   And I realized, "Oh my goodness, here is this thriving community of people.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.820]   They're having conventions, they're having meetings, they have their podcasts, they have
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:53.260]   their profits, they have all of these people in the community that are saying, 'You don't
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.660]   have to live the way your parents did and here's how you can do it and here's how you
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.140]   can afford it.'"
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.900]   And that opened my eyes completely and then that led on to people that are doing different
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.620]   things in real estate like with the van life community or with food, people that are opting
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.740]   out of major food systems.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:16.240]   And Christy and I realized that there are all these people with the same kind of common
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.420]   denominator of finding their own way forward.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.380]   So here's what we've done so far.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.460]   We met a wonderful family.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.340]   They just wrote a book.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.460]   Elizabeth Thames is the name of the author.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.620]   She wrote a book called Meet the Frugal Woods.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:35.940]   She and her husband saved a major percentage of their income while they lived in urban
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:41.420]   centers throughout their 20s and they've become financially independent in their early 30s.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:46.220]   And with that independence, they chose to move to a homestead in rural Vermont where
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.940]   they live with their family now.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.300]   And they have the choice of how and when they want to work and how and when they want to
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.900]   spend time with their family.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.260]   And so we got to see their farmstead and see what it takes to live a life like that and
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.140]   what it takes to get there.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:08.740]   It takes a lot of sacrifice, a lot of work, but it is possible to become financially independent.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:14.260]   And then we went up into the mountains of New Hampshire and we embedded with a group
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.460]   that's called the Free State Project.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.080]   And they have an annual meetup in the woods of New Hampshire.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:27.060]   This is a movement to bring 20,000, I guess you could say broadly, libertarians to all
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:32.940]   move to the state of New Hampshire to kind of in part create a voting block, in part
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:38.300]   to build a community of anarchists, minarchists, libertarians, people that believe in a small
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.620]   state and kind of take over the state from within in their own way and set up their own
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:48.340]   systems, part of which are off grid, part of which are kind of their own little economy
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:54.740]   that is not attached to kind of mainstream ways of selling and buying goods.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:45:00.880]   And we met so many different types of people that are living their lives the way they want
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.020]   to live on their terms.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:08.020]   And that community in New Hampshire is just thriving with people who have opted out.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.500]   And I think one of the big, one of the most interesting things I found is we've spoken
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:18.060]   with people, generally speaking, on the political far left, the political far right, and everywhere
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.780]   in between.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:25.180]   And in this really polarized political time, you find incredible similarities between the
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:30.380]   most conservative person and the most liberal person and the reasons that they want to build
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.060]   their own systems and opt out of the way everyone else has told them they need to live.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.540]   Not to be all kumbaya here, but there's a lot more that unites us with these people.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.060]   If you just step back, get off political Twitter.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.740]   And which you have been part of for many years.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.060]   And just talk to people.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:55.060]   You will find that people are speaking the same language, but unfortunately, they're
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.740]   not listening to one another.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.920]   Just one comment on that.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.300]   You mentioned political Twitter.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:08.860]   I have a, I don't know what to call it, a soft spot, an indulgence, a weakness, an
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.860]   addiction.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:14.460]   I have a, I am prone to political Twitter.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:18.740]   And one of the things that I have learned that I've had to do is just disconnect from
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.100]   it because it's so destructive.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:26.460]   And I don't know if I'm an addict, a Twitter addict, hi, my name is Joshua and I'm a Twitter
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:35.500]   addict or something, but it seems like I have to run so far away from the bottle that I
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.980]   can't even look across the county at the bar.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.620]   Otherwise, I wind up wending my way back into it.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.980]   Just obviously, you're talking about it in terms of an addiction.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:51.540]   But as I've gotten on the road, I've been able to more easily and more consistently,
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.700]   and you don't have to go travel for this.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.060]   I've put all kinds of safeguards in place in other times as well, but it's just a little
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.660]   easier on the road to be totally away from the internet.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:06.700]   And as I've done that, I go back and it just all looks so stupid.
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.240]   And I think, is this what I thought mattered?
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.660]   This is stupid.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:16.100]   And yet, this is something that these stupid arguments, these stupid debates, this was
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.180]   something that I thought was really important a few years ago when I was embroiled in the
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.940]   midst of it.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:26.980]   And it's fascinating because you're right, there is so much more that unites us than
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.580]   that divides us, but it sure seems like you've got to take a step back to recognize that.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:39.100]   You do, and part of the opting out has to be from technology addiction.
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.620]   Technology is a very powerful thing.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:42.620]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.620]   It's connected lots of people.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:44.620]   It's changed lives.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.480]   It's created new economies and new marketplaces.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:52.800]   But it's roped a lot of us in to a point where we're neglecting things that are more important,
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.300]   our families and our communities.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.300]   And there's something about scrolling that part of Twitter or YouTube that makes you
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.300]   mad.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.700]   It's endorphins that makes you feel good in a weird, strange way.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.980]   But tell me the truth, Josh, after the end of an hour of scrolling political Twitter,
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:10.980]   do you feel really good?
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   I don't think you do.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   >>JOSHUA COREY Absolutely not.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:13.980]   No question.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.980]   >>ANDREW BRODIN Of course not.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.660]   >>JOSHUA COREY It affects me big time.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.020]   >>ANDREW BRODIN Right.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   But it's not necessarily our fault because these systems are so powerful.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:29.900]   They do reel us in in a way, and that includes pretty pictures on Instagram, even that too.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.460]   It is addicting, and it's important to set up those safeguards just like someone who
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.700]   has another kind of addiction will need to do as well.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.060]   And you're right, being on the road does help.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.000]   But without those safeguards, I'm the same way, and I think many people are.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.460]   You just find yourself roped back in.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:51.760]   And I think that is what is really exacerbating this moment, this cultural moment that we're
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.420]   living in right now.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:59.380]   Because the hate, all the anger is around you at all times.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:05.180]   You feel completely surrounded by it because you're consuming it from morning until night.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.620]   And people didn't used to do that.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:12.740]   And I think that whatever this is, is really doing a number on people's psyches, on people's
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.700]   souls.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.580]   And we have to be able to control ourselves, but it is really difficult to do so.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.860]   And I think the only way to do is to set up hedges that protect us.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:26.620]   Otherwise, we're just going to sit and binge on Netflix all day.
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:27.620]   At least I would.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.740]   Indeed.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.340]   It's one thing about doing all your internet through a data plan where you have a cap.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.340]   Limits are healthy.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.500]   Budgets are healthy.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.420]   Data caps on your phone are healthy.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.100]   Hedges are healthy, just like we talked about earlier in terms of the structure of a day.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.460]   So my hope, Chris and Christy, is that my community, the radicals here who are part
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.660]   of Radical Personal Finance, can help you to discover some cool new stories that you
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.740]   can use in the book that you're writing, in the projects that you're working on about
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.140]   people who have opted out.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:05.000]   Because I know of, there are some amazing people in the audience here.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.020]   So who would you like to connect with and what kinds of stories would you like to be
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:17.440]   able to hear and to profile that will help you with the project that you're working on?
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.140]   So we are traveling the country and talking to people who are choosing to live differently
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.700]   and opt out of the mainstream.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.320]   But our topics are very broad.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.100]   So of course, your audience is the personal finance audience.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:38.660]   We'd love to talk to people who are part of the FIRE community, who are choosing to retire
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:43.860]   early, who are choosing to be very frugal, and all of those things.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:49.220]   We're also looking to talk to people who are choosing to opt out of real estate, like we
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.900]   said, not just live in a van or live mobily, but people who are living off the grid, who
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:00.460]   are homesteading, who are choosing to grow their own food, choosing to be self-sufficient
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:05.500]   from the rest of the grid.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.860]   We want to talk to people who are opting out of technology in different ways, people who
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.820]   are choosing to opt in to different types of intentional communities or intentional
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.320]   lifestyles.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.820]   So it's very broad.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:25.820]   Basically, anyone who's choosing to live outside the normal suburban, 9-to-5 job, white
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.740]   collar, have lots of stuff in your garage kind of lifestyle, those are the people we
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.740]   want to talk to.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.900]   And if anyone can get me into Camp Mustache so I can see what that's all about, that'd
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.900]   be awesome too.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.900]   Yeah, we'd really like to do that.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.900]   That's easy.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:42.020]   As I sit here recording this, I'm sitting here in Mr. Money Mustache's co-working space
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.100]   in downtown Longmont.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:49.620]   We just had a meetup last night and so I could do that for you, Chris.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.860]   I could easily make that happen.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   Great success.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.860]   All right.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.860]   Indeed.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:59.180]   Well, tell us all the website, the news profiles that you set up as far as the news channels
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.740]   where people can follow you and follow your journey.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.740]   All right.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.740]   Pull out your phone.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:13.220]   Follow us at LifeOptedOut on Instagram, L-I-F-E-O-P-T-E-D-O-U-T, LifeOptedOut, and on LifeOptedOut.com.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:18.620]   And then you can email us at OptOutMedia@gmail.com.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.040]   That's OptOutMedia@gmail.com.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Love to hear from people.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.100]   Love to hear your stories.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.060]   And hopefully we can come visit and say hello.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:29.700]   We're also going to be launching our own podcast, LifeOptedOut podcast, to tell the stories
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.580]   of the people that we're meeting.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:37.220]   And we're really excited to meet all different kinds of people because I truly do believe
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:42.460]   that this is a story about a moment in our country's history that is really going to
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:45.940]   be important and really pave the way for how we live in the future.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.940]   So let's hear your stories.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.740]   We feel that there's many ways for people to live out their values.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.820]   And really the uniting theme between all the different types of people that we would like
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:03.180]   to interview are people who are choosing to live intentionally, to live according to a
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.900]   very specific set of values.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.300]   And it's not that we necessarily are endorsing everyone's extreme lifestyles or everyone's
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.020]   values out there.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:17.580]   But we think that being exposed to new ideas causes us to stop and think and question our
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:23.260]   own life choices and hopefully helps us to live a better life in the future.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.900]   And be more empathetic as well.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.900]   Absolutely.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.900]   Chris Christie, thank you for coming on.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.100]   I'll link to all of those pages in the show notes for today and I hope we can meet up
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.820]   out on the road.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.380]   Thanks for having us, Josh.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.160]   Happy trails.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.540]   As we close today's interview, I want to bring your attention to a few themes that you can
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.980]   observe in Chris and Christie's story.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:48.500]   And I hope that you will file them away in the back of your mind in case they ever become
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.220]   useful to you.
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:55.860]   Number one, if you are ever laid off, I want to encourage you to view that layoff as an
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   opportunity.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:03.820]   Now, if you are in financial distress at the time of your layoff, it will most likely not
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.220]   be easy to view it as an opportunity.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:10.820]   At the very least, you should view it as an opportunity to get a newer and better job.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.420]   After all, they pushed you out the door.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.820]   Maybe you can go and find something better.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.500]   But if you're not in financial distress, and I beg of you, make sure that you're not in
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.500]   financial distress.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.700]   Make sure that you're spending much less than you're making.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.540]   Make sure that you have savings on hand.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.860]   Make sure that your debt burden is low.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:28.740]   And if you'll do those things, you will not be in financial distress should you ever become
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.920]   laid off.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.620]   So if you're not in financial distress, then I encourage you consider viewing a layoff
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:39.660]   as an opportunity for you to do something that you have wanted to do for a while.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.820]   Here's what's cool.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.340]   Frequently a layoff will come with something like a severance package, especially if you
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.420]   work in a white collar industry.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:52.380]   That severance package can give you a place where you can begin something new while having
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:54.340]   income from something old.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.500]   Go back and listen to the episode that I did with a financial samurai on how to get laid
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.660]   off from your job.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.340]   Consider getting his book.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:05.060]   But one of the great things is if you get laid off, you can use that as a point in time
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.980]   where you're freed from some of your day-to-day obligations and you can try something new.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:15.060]   One of the themes that I'm convinced has a great deal of value is in your life to pursue
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:20.680]   a series of sabbaticals, or one of the common terms used today is mini-retirements.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.180]   This is not a new concept.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:27.360]   The concept is simply that every few years you need a time of rest, a time of change,
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.220]   and you can work this in intentionally into your life.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.380]   Now sabbaticals are most common in the academic context, but just because they're common there
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.860]   doesn't mean that you can't use them.
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:41.460]   Every seven years, every ten years, plan to take six months or a year off.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:45.340]   And what you'll do is if you find yourself doing that, you can come back to your work
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:49.940]   re-energized and rejuvenated and ready to go with a new project, ready to go with new
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.340]   focus for another period of time.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:57.100]   You can negotiate this in the context of your current job, probably.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.340]   Many people have, but some people can't.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:05.060]   But what you can do is take advantage of a layoff to go on some sort of sabbatical, pursue
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.980]   some kind of project.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.420]   Maybe it's a traveling project like Chris and Christy are doing where they've loaded
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.760]   up their van and they're traveling the country.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.500]   Maybe it's a research project.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.420]   Maybe you just want to work on your French and so you move to the south of France and
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:20.220]   spend a year there speaking French every day.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.340]   That's up to you.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.700]   But use it as an opportunity.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:30.220]   If you will use that time of layoff and take a few months to think, work on something personal,
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.900]   take a vacation, then you'll be able to go into your next job more refreshed and rejuvenated.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.400]   Here's a warning to you.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.520]   Make sure that you keep your career going.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.500]   The best way to keep your career going is keep your connections strong.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.180]   Make sure that while you're in that time of layoff that you're keeping your connections
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.880]   to your career and you're keeping your network alive.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.960]   It's also important that you have a good story to tell.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.660]   So Chris and Christy, depending on what happens in the next year, they may wind up publishing
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.300]   their book and that is the launch of something new that they're excited about.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.540]   Or they may return to their old careers.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.760]   But the neat thing about it is they'll have a story to tell.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.620]   So while they're in that interview, whenever they finish their trip, they will be asked
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.540]   about what have you done in the last year and they'll have a story to tell.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.220]   They'll probably have a book to show.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.700]   They'll have a media platform to show.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:25.860]   And that will separate them and set them apart and distinguish them from many of their competitors
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:30.720]   who are competing for any jobs or businesses that they're seeking to build.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.340]   So I encourage you, view a layoff as an opportunity.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.620]   Number two, be flexible in your thinking.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:41.660]   You'll notice that Chris and Christy are pursuing a very minimal approach to traveling.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.540]   That can have a lot of advantages.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:47.020]   One of the great advantages is the pure fun of traveling.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.780]   It's a lot easier to travel with a small, inexpensive rig that you've built yourself.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:56.540]   You can go more places and do more things, but it's also much more financially feasible.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:02.020]   So if you have a goal of doing something like traveling, look for what's the minimum viable
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.900]   equipment.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.680]   What's the minimum that you're willing to accept and go with that.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:12.460]   Don't think that you need $300,000 for a 40-foot diesel pusher motor coach.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.220]   Look to do it simpler and easier.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:21.660]   And finally, pursue a project that you're interested in and make sure that you make
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:28.220]   time to cultivate a lifestyle where you are able to pursue those interests.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.340]   One of the neat things that Chris and Christy mentioned is even while they were in the busy
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:37.580]   Manhattan lifestyle or while they were in the busy Washington DC lifestyle, Chris was
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.700]   a veteran political reporter.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.940]   Even while they were in that, they were very intentional about the way that they lived.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.940]   You don't have to live in a van down by the river to have some quiet time, but you do
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.100]   have to turn your phone off and leave it at the front door.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:57.540]   It might be easier to have a little more quiet time living in a van down by the river, but
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.660]   it might not because there's a whole lot of work associated with that.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:05.260]   So wherever you are and whatever you're doing, take time to enjoy the beauty around you.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.780]   Take time to enjoy the beauty of relationship.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.940]   Take time to be present and think about the life choices that you make.
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.980]   There are many people who are pursuing all kinds of what are called alternative lifestyles,
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:19.940]   but you know what?
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.700]   There are a lot of commonalities between those.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.700]   Perhaps Chris and Christy published their book.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.540]   Perhaps those commonalities will be clearly identified, but I have some ideas, which is
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.100]   why I started talking to them about the project.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.100]   I have some ideas.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.340]   Maybe I'll share them with you in a future podcast.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:40.380]   But almost no matter where you go, no matter what point of the political spectrum you look
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:47.340]   at, no matter what point of the ideological spectrum, there are some really common variables
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.140]   that if you start analyzing the problems of modern life, you frequently arrive at some
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.940]   simple, common solutions.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.940]   So consider those things for yourself.
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.020]   Hope you enjoyed the interview.
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.380]   Thank you for listening.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380]   Thank you for listening.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.620]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.420]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.140]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.580]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:24.260]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.300]   action on it.
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.740]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.060]   to a life change.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:38.060]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.740]   So take action.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:45.360]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.940]   that you care about.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:54.140]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.580]   that I'm seeking to share.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.100]   That helps the person that you are engaging with.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.740]   And it also helps you because teaching others is one of the most effective ways for you
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.260]   to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.580]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:19.280]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.940]   this work voluntarily.

[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:43.740]   But if you're gaining financial benefit from this show, and if it's achieving financial
