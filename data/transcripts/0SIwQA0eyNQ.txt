[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   You know what, this is the year for cash back.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.720]   Let's forget about points.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.560]   What do I do?
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.800]   Are there any other cards that you could pair
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.480]   with a card earning three, 4% cash back
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.400]   that even makes sense?
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.800]   If we start first, assuming you have the smartly card,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.000]   it's a really easy filter.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   You're looking for any card where you can earn more than 4%
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.880]   and there aren't a lot of cards,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.480]   even on categories that earn that much more.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.540]   The most common cards that I would say can beat 4%
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.140]   are there's a handful of cards
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.120]   that do these rotating categories
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.180]   or categories that you pick
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.180]   like the Bank of America Customized Cash,
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.820]   the Citi Custom Cash, US Bank Cash Plus,
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.780]   where you earn five, sometimes 6% on some amount of money
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.020]   that when you annualize it ends up being
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.360]   around six to $10,000 a year.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180]   But if you go all the way to the top and say,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.380]   okay, let's look at a 5% card
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.160]   that's gonna earn that on $10,000 a year,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.080]   relative to getting 4%,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.900]   you're really just getting an extra 1% on $10,000,
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.420]   which is just $100.
