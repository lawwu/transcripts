[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in chapter 8, and reading a selection of verses, starting
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.740]   with the thirteenth verse, "Then Simon himself believed also, and when he was baptized he
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:29.120]   continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.140]   Again in the eighteenth verse, "And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles'
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.360]   hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this power,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.240]   that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.720]   But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.360]   the gift of God may be purchased with money; thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.120]   for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.880]   Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray, God, if perhaps the thought of thine
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.140]   heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.960]   in the bond of iniquity.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.720]   Then answered Simon and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.400]   which ye have spoken come upon me."
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.000]   Now, this is the most extraordinary case that we are going to look at together this evening.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.920]   Those who come here regularly will know that in dealing with the earlier part of the history
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.720]   that is recorded in this chapter, of how the gospel first began to spread from the city
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.120]   of Jerusalem, as our Lord had prophesied that it would do, first in Judea itself, and then
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.640]   in Samaria, and then to the uttermost ends of the earth.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.920]   You remember how in dealing with the story of how Philip the Evangelist went down to
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.560]   Samaria and preached the gospel there, with the marvellous and wonderful results that
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.400]   are described here, we incidentally were introduced to this man Simon.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.880]   Now, this is what we were told about him.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   There was a certain man called Simon, which before time in the same city used sorcery
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.160]   and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one, to whom
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.960]   they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the great
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   power of God."
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.680]   And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.920]   But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.400]   name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.520]   And then, you see, the record goes on to tell us that Simon himself believed also.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.680]   And when he was baptised, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.520]   and signs which were done.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.760]   But then you remember that the thing we were looking at last Sunday night happened.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.520]   The apostles in Jerusalem heard that as the result of the preaching of Philip in the power
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.160]   of the Holy Spirit, a number of these people in Samaria had believed the gospel.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.080]   Now, that was a very surprising thing for these apostles who were Jews.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.240]   However, they believed the report, and they sent down two of the company, namely Peter
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240]   and John.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.120]   And you remember, we were told how when these apostles had prayed for these people in Samaria,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.080]   they laid their hands upon them, and as the result of that, the Holy Ghost fell upon these
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.400]   people.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.040]   And then, you see, we have this extraordinary statement that when this man Simon saw that
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.440]   through laying on of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.600]   money, saying, "Give me also this power," and the rest of the story.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.560]   Well, now, why do I call attention to this?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.240]   Well, I have many reasons for doing that.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.080]   One is that it is a part of the history.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.160]   And it's not for me to decide or to choose what I expound to you from the Scriptures.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.040]   As I've been explaining Sunday after Sunday, I'm directing attention to these early chapters
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.960]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, because it is thus alone we can really come to know
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.160]   what Christianity really is, and as to what the Christian church is really meant to be.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.000]   I have to say again, unfortunately, that this is something which has become difficult in
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   the modern world.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.920]   There are so many different vices, there are so many misrepresentations, and that is why
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.840]   I feel that the people are confused with the world as it is.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.080]   And this is the only hope for any individual or for the world.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.620]   There is no greater tragedy than the confusion with respect to this gospel.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.840]   That's why we're dealing with it.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.360]   And here we have the authentic account.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.480]   If you really want to know what Christianity is, here it is.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.400]   And the point I've been emphasizing all along is this, that it is history.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   It is historical.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.900]   Now, let's get rid of the notion once and forever that this is just a teaching.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.640]   It isn't.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.520]   What Christians believe is the result of something that has happened in this world of time.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.120]   It is sheer history.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.000]   This puts it into a different category.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.920]   And so, we must always be true to the history.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.680]   And as this is something that happened in connection with the spread of the gospel,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.800]   I've got to call your attention to it, whether I want to do so or not.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   It's not a happy thing to do, to call attention to a case like this.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.420]   But I want to try to show you what an important thing it is to do.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.120]   And that is why I am doing it.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   What do we find here?
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.000]   Well, now, there are a number of things that should strike us at once as we come across
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.960]   a story like this.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.500]   The first is the amazing honesty of the Scriptures.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.400]   They conceal nothing.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.280]   It isn't some carefully concocted account; it's an honest report.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.200]   These are the things that literally and actually happened.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.300]   I would say once more that if I had no other reason for believing the Scriptures to be
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.520]   the Word of God, that would in itself be sufficient for me.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.880]   It not only paints the good things in its characters and people and in its institutions,
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.360]   it tells you everything about them.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.060]   It shows you the weaknesses of some of its noblest characters.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.720]   It shows saints falling into sin.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   And why does it do this?
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.200]   Well, it does this for our benefit.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   It's open.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   It's honest.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.040]   It's a book that you can trust.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.800]   It's not some special plea.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.320]   So at once we are struck by the honesty of the Scriptures as revealed in this story.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.480]   And that leads me to put it in another way, which is this.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.880]   The purpose of the Scriptures is not to boost Christianity.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.600]   Now that's where this faith of ours differs from all the cults and so many other teachings.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.820]   The literature attached to those is always out to boost them.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's like a quack medicine bottle.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.800]   It makes its extravagant claims.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.840]   It never tells you anything about the remedy whatsoever.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.520]   All is in fill.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.680]   Everything seems to be perfect.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.920]   Now the Scriptures are not like that at all.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.680]   It is not, I say, a case of special pleading.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.520]   The Scriptures have only one grand objective, and that is to bring us to a knowledge of
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.360]   the truth.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.480]   The Scriptures are not just out to win adherence to the Christian church.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.040]   Incidentally, of course, that follows, but that's not the primary object.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.120]   The primary object is to present the truth.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.400]   How man in his methods and in his movements and in his institutions is so different.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.920]   Man is anxious to get adherence, he wants to get followers, and he's not always scrupulous
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.700]   as to how he does so.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.000]   The members of the different political parties, they bring out all the excellences of what
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.560]   they've done, they say nothing about the other side.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.960]   When they deal with the others, they only show the defects and say nothing about the
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   good points.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.760]   Now that's the way of man.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.840]   Scriptures don't do that.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:41.400]   Members are concerned to present the truth to us, that we may know exactly what it is.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.000]   And you notice that they do that in two main ways.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.520]   They do this positively, and they do this negatively.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.760]   Now so far in taking this story in the eighth chapter of Acts, we've been looking at the
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.440]   positive presentation of the gospel and of the truth.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.600]   We've been told of what Philip said, and what the others who were scattered abroad
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.320]   in the persecution said.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.280]   They preached the Word, they preached Christ, they preached Jesus Christ and the things
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.120]   pertaining to the kingdom of God.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.600]   And we've seen the response and the reaction, all that is positive.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:25.120]   And there, as I've been trying to show you, we've seen what the gospel is, how men believe
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.800]   it, what happens to them as the result of believing it, and we've seen therefore a
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.440]   general picture as to what the Christian Church is.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.240]   That's one way of discovering what this message is.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.120]   But you see, it isn't the only one.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:46.200]   The Scriptures present the truth to us also in a negative manner, and that is the thing
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:53.320]   that we have here this evening in this case of Simon the Sorcerer.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.800]   Not only are we given the positive presentation of the truth, we see the truth by contrast
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:09.040]   with the false, the spurious, that which simulates the truth, but is not the actual truth itself,
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.460]   but is merely some kind of temporary appearance.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.280]   Now the Scriptures, you see, in their honesty, they give us this in order that they may warn
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:25.080]   us against the false, and in order that we may be more certain of the truth.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.160]   And so, as we look at the case of this man Simon, we shall not only be seeing what the
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.320]   false is, but by the contrast which he presents to the others, we shall see still more clearly
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.840]   what the truth is.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.440]   Because on the surface, you see, this man Simon is in exactly the same position as the
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.660]   other people who believed in Samaria, and yet he wasn't in the same position.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.040]   And as we see why he wasn't and how he wasn't, we shall see still more clearly how they were,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:04.080]   and how different they were, and how they represent what is the truly Christian position.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.080]   Why do you think the Scriptures take all this trouble?
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.360]   Why was this man Luke who wrote this book of Acts, led and inspired by the Spirit, to
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.920]   record the case of this particular man Simon the Saucer?
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.880]   And I say that the answer obviously is that it is a part of the love of God to us.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   He is anxious to safeguard our interests.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:39.120]   Or let me put it to you like this, our eternal salvation depends upon our relationship to
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.920]   this message.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   That's why we preach it.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.860]   We don't preach it as a human experience.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.360]   We don't preach it as something that's going to make us feel a little bit happier for the
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   moment.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   No, no, we preach this for this reason, that it is not only something that affects a man's
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.040]   life in this world, it affects a man's death.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.880]   I go further, it is something that affects our eternal destiny.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.520]   Now it is because the Scriptures teach that and hold that view, that they take the trouble
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.400]   to put a case like this before us.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   You see, as my eternal destiny depends upon my right relationship to this truth, there
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:29.040]   is nothing in the universe tonight which is so important as my being certain that I am
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.200]   in the right relationship.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.400]   I may think I am, but I may not be.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:42.920]   So you see, the Gospels and these books have been written for us in order that we may have
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:51.400]   no doubt, no uncertainty, that we may know in no sense be deceiving or misleading ourselves.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.840]   Now I am certain that that is why we have this particular bit of history.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.160]   How much easier it would have been for the author to slide over this and just give us
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.400]   this marvellous picture of the results of Philip's preaching, and we could have ended
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.800]   on the note there was great joy in that city, and then the apostles came and they laid hands
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.120]   on them, and they were filled with the Spirit, and there was still greater joy, and they
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.160]   were thrilled and in an ecstasy.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   How marvellous!
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.920]   And then this discordant note suddenly thrown in.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   Why?
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:28.720]   Ah, I say there is only one real explanation.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.960]   It is the love of God that is concerned that we should never be deluded or misled.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.560]   It is in order that our souls' eternal salvation may be made secure.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:49.120]   I see this as a glorious example of God's concern about the souls of men, that he troubles
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.320]   not only to give us the truth positively, but also to give it us negatively, in order
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.360]   that we may examine ourselves by it.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   Very well.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   What is the lesson here?
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.640]   Well, I have tried to divide it like this for you.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.280]   The first thing that obviously strikes us here is this, that it is clearly possible
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:14.560]   for us to think that we are Christians without being Christians at all.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:22.520]   It is possible for us to delude ourselves and to imagine that we are Christians, and
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.200]   we are not really Christians at all.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:32.120]   Now, this is perfectly clear, isn't it, in the case of this man, Simon the Sorcerer.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.200]   Others believed the gospel; he, we are told, Simon himself believed also, and when he was
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.240]   baptized he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   done.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.760]   Well, I can imagine someone saying, "Well, what an extraordinary thing to present that
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.760]   before us.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.400]   I would have thought that you, a great object, was just to do everything you can to persuade
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.000]   people to become Christians."
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It is.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.960]   And yet, you see, this is necessary, because this kind of thing can happen.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.200]   Here is a man who thought he was a Christian, but he wasn't.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.800]   Now, he is not the only one.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.680]   There are other examples and illustrations of the same thing in other parts of the scriptures.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.200]   Listen to this at the end of the second chapter of the gospel according to St. John.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:27.440]   "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, this is our Lord, in the feast day, many believed
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.760]   in his name when they saw the miracles which he did.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:39.800]   But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.880]   any should testify of men, for he knew what was in men."
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.640]   Now, this is the thing, you see, that astonishes people so often.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.920]   And I'll tell you why I'm dealing with this.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.520]   You all know many people, I've known many people, who are outside the Christian church
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.080]   and are not interested in Christianity because they talk about hypocrisy.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:09.120]   It's a pack of hypocrites, and they're not interested.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.960]   I want to try to show you that the church herself is as concerned about hypocrites as
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.240]   you are.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.400]   The church never pretends that she's perfect.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.440]   Here she is telling us that it is possible for people to think they're Christians when
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.520]   they're not, to come into the church when they really shouldn't be in the church.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.640]   This is the thing, again, that always attracts me in these Gospels.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.060]   The Lord Jesus Christ, at times, seems to be going out of his way to hinder people from
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.720]   coming to him.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.800]   He discouraged them.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.960]   Why did he do that?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.200]   There's only one reason.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.480]   He had come into the world to save the world.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.080]   Yes, but when he sees people coming to him in the wrong way, or for the wrong reason,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   he discourages them, for their sakes.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.960]   So we must get rid of this notion that the church is just here as an institution that
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.640]   wants to flourish, and as big business and other businesses flourish with a greater number
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.640]   of customers.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.000]   You know, the man on the street, he says this sort of thing.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.800]   "Ah," he says, "those parsons, they're fighting for their jobs, they're losing the people
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.880]   at the present time, and there they are, they're wheedling and cajoling, they're doing everything
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.300]   they can to win people, and they don't care how as long as they can get them."
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.680]   I'm trying to show you tonight that it's the exact opposite.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:28.160]   The Bible's not interested primarily in numbers, it is very interested in truth and in reality.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.440]   And it is this book itself that shows the false, the hypocritical, the spurious, and
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.080]   warns us against it.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.960]   Our Lord, you see, there in Jerusalem, he saw these people coming to him, and they were
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.880]   smiling and they wanted to join the company, he wouldn't have them, because he knew that
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.120]   they were coming for a wrong reason.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.520]   That they thought they'd understood his message, but he realized that they hadn't.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.200]   But that's not the only example that I can give you of this.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.480]   Take that parable of the sower that we read at the beginning.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.160]   Now what's the point of that parable?
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.880]   Isn't it just to do this very thing?
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.120]   Here is our Lord himself saying that he was not misled by appearances.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:20.760]   He says, "There are people who seem to accept this truth of mine, but they haven't really.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.900]   There's a temporary appearance of believing the truth, but it's not real, it doesn't last,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.840]   it's of no value."
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.160]   And he puts it quite plainly there in the parable of the sower and in his own exposition
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.000]   of that parable.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.480]   Then he does it again in the three parables that are recorded in the twenty-fifth chapter
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.640]   of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.720]   You remember the first one, the parable of the ten virgins, five wise, five foolish.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.920]   That's a parable of profession.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.360]   That's a parable of people inside the church, all of them thinking they're Christians.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   But our Lord's whole object is to show that half of them are not Christians at all.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.600]   Foolish virgins, thinking they were Christians when they were not Christians.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.080]   Likewise the second parable of the talents, likewise the parable of the sheep and goats,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:12.000]   which is the third parable in that tremendously important chapter.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.600]   Now you see in all these instances what our Lord is doing is to show us that we've got
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.480]   to be certain of these things.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.880]   There is nothing more terrible than for a man to think that he's a Christian when
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.760]   he isn't.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   There is nothing more terrifying than for a man to go through his lifetime thinking
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.240]   that he's a Christian and that he is safe, and to find at the end that he's been misleading
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.720]   himself altogether.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.760]   You remember the terrifying way in which our Lord puts that at the end of the Sermon on
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.760]   the Mount.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.500]   These are his very words.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:57.520]   He says, "Not every one that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter into the
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:03.320]   kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name,
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.760]   and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?'
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:27.240]   And then will I profess unto them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.'"
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:34.440]   Now it is because of this, you see, that the scriptures give us these cases of warning,
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.760]   such as this of Simon the sorcerer.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.680]   Here is a man who was fully satisfied that he was a Christian, and yet the record shows
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.880]   us that he was never a Christian at all.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.160]   Well, now then, the second question is, how does this come to pass?
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.120]   And I needn't wear you in describing the various ways in which it can happen.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.700]   It doesn't happen as much today as it once did.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.680]   But sometimes people think they're Christians when they're not, because they've been
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.220]   brought up in a Christian atmosphere.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.200]   There is this fatal idea that because you're the child of Christian parents that you are
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.800]   automatically a Christian.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.320]   The history of the Church shows this so frequently.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.540]   The children of Christians, in a sense, are in a very dangerous position, because they
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.560]   assume they're Christians and everybody else assumes that they're Christians.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.040]   They of all people need to test and examine themselves in the light of this particular
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   teaching.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.480]   There's not a person who says to me, "I've always been a Christian.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.920]   I was brought up to be a Christian.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.480]   I was always a Christian."
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.800]   My dear friend, there's only one answer to that, you know.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.220]   Nobody's born a Christian.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.860]   The whole message here is that you've got to be born again to be a Christian.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:55.760]   But how easy it is to assume, because of our upbringing, our family, our custom, our loyalty
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   to parents.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.260]   Indeed, I have known some strange reasons for people falling into this very error of
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.680]   Simon Magus.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:11.640]   I remember one man in particular who persuaded himself that he was a Christian for one reason
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.800]   only, and that was that he wanted to marry a particular girl.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.460]   I'm not saying he was dishonest.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.720]   I say he was misleading himself.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.540]   He persuaded himself.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.960]   What he was really after was to get this girl.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.520]   And so he, like Simon said, he believed.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.600]   He accepted everything.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.400]   But the man was never truly a Christian.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.300]   Facts made that perfectly clear afterwards.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.960]   I'm only giving you these things as illustrations of how we may be moved and animated by false
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   motives.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:49.600]   And another very common cause of this, of course, is this, that if there is ever a general
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:56.080]   interest in these matters, certain people always tend to be carried with the crowd,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.980]   what is called today getting under the bandwagon.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.520]   If there's a big religious campaign, or if there's a religious revival, you'll always
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.720]   find certain people are carried along by everybody's believing so they believe.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.160]   I'm not again saying they're dishonest.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.400]   I could easily demonstrate to you that there are two main types of hypocrisy, conscious
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:21.120]   hypocrisy and unconscious hypocrisy, and I'm dealing with unconscious hypocrisy.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.820]   I believe this man belongs to that.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.120]   He had no idea that it was false.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:33.240]   Neither of these people were carried along by the stream, as it were, and everybody seems
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.360]   to be believing so they believe.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.920]   They don't quite know why, but they do what others do, and so they think that they're
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   Christians.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.960]   Because another reason, let me admit it quite frankly and honestly, is often to be laid
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.760]   at the door of an evangelist who presses for immediate decisions, and gives the impression
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.760]   that if you don't do it at once you'll never have a chance again, and urges people
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:03.280]   and brings pressure to bear upon them to take some visible decision.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.240]   There is nothing that is more prolific of this very case of Simon the Sorcerer than
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:16.820]   just that, because of this pressure that should never be brought to bear upon anybody.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.840]   The more you study this case and see the contrast between Simon and the others, the more you
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   will see this.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:28.280]   You see, what makes a man a Christian is not that he decides for Christ.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.200]   It is that he's born again.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.840]   It is that the Spirit of God lays hold on him, and if the Spirit of God lays hold on
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.280]   him it's bound to show itself.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.600]   I don't care whether it shows itself tonight or in ten years' time, that's the thing
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.080]   that matters.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.660]   Not the registration on earth, but the registration in heaven, that's the thing that matters.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:57.560]   And so there is so often this confusion, and I could give you many stories as a pastor
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.340]   of how this confusion has been brought to pass.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:05.000]   And people come to me and they say, "You know, I want you to tell me am I a Christian
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   or am I not?"
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.720]   And I say, "I don't know."
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.480]   What they mean is this, they said, "I took a decision, I signed a card, I did this, that,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   and the other."
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.440]   But you know, I doubt whether I am a Christian.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.080]   What a wonderful thing is that that's the Spirit of God dealing with them.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.320]   I always like to be told a thing like that, because here are people who have examined
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.680]   themselves and they haven't merely gone on in the assumption.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.720]   So you see, it is the Scripture that teaches one to do this kind of thing.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.360]   I don't rely upon what I say nor upon what you do.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.400]   We must rely upon what the Spirit of God does.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.160]   Simon himself believed also.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:50.840]   Very well, here is one great reason, general reasons, why this kind of thing becomes possible.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.360]   But you see, the ultimate explanation of it all is this.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.160]   And that's what comes out so terrifyingly in this case, and that is the deceitfulness
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.960]   of the natural and regenerate human heart.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:12.640]   You remember how Jeremiah puts it, "The heart of man is desperately wicked and deceitful.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.000]   Who can know it?"
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.460]   It's so deceitful that a man himself doesn't know it.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.520]   And the heart is so subtle.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.080]   If it thinks it can get peace and quiet and rest, if it thinks it can silence its conscience
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.680]   by doing something, it will do it.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.600]   You see, the trouble with us all by nature is we not only fool other people, we fool
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.240]   ourselves.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.400]   And that's the greatest folly of all, isn't it?
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.080]   That you fool yourself.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.000]   You think you've been clever.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.560]   It's because you've forgotten God, who cannot be fooled, and who knows the heart and who
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.920]   tries it, and who alone sees us exactly as we are.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.160]   But the natural and regenerate heart, oh, how deceitful it is.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.760]   A man thinks he can be in the church and out of it at the same time.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.280]   He thinks he can have his fill of pleasure in the world and go to heaven, because he
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   believes in Christ.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.320]   He'll believe in anything, as long as he gets his own will and his own way, the deceitfulness
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.920]   of the natural heart.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.320]   Have you realized that your heart is deceitful?
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.980]   Are you still trusting yourself?
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.680]   If you are, you are not a Christian.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.120]   This is the natural and regenerate heart.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.640]   There is nothing more deceitful than the natural heart of men.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:44.360]   But in addition to this, you see, there is the devil, the adversary of our souls.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.760]   And the apostle Paul tells us that the devil sometimes will transform himself into an angel
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.960]   of light.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.800]   You know, the devil is quite prepared to tell a man to believe in Christ and to persuade
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:04.040]   him that he's done so, if in that way he can ensure the loss of that man's soul.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:10.000]   The devil will encourage a man to say he believes, if he knows that that's going to silence
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.240]   the man's conscience, if that is going to stop a man thinking and reasoning and investigating
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.320]   and making sure of where he is.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.200]   The devil will make a man say, "All you've got to do is to say, 'I believe in the Lord
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   Jesus Christ.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   You're all right.'"
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.520]   And the man says, "This is rather wonderful.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.360]   I can go on, of course, and enjoy myself.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.960]   If I send it all out, blood of Christ, oh, how often have we all done this.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.440]   How often have I seen men doing it, healing the hurt of the daughter of my people, lightly
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.000]   and slightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.360]   Remember a man coming to me, who had committed a terrible sin.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.040]   He came to tell me about it quite honestly, but before I had time to say anything to him,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.360]   he said, 'But of course I know it's all right.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.480]   The blood of Jesus covers it.'
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   And he was too healthy.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.400]   The man hadn't felt the enormity of the sin.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.560]   That's how the devil uses scripture.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:09.000]   The devil also believes, says James, and trembles.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.600]   And the devil, as an angel of light, will get people to take decisions, if he thinks
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.560]   that that's going to stand between them, and regeneration and rebirth, and the agony of
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:27.720]   soul that will lead them to cry out unto God to deal with them and to give them new life.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.960]   These are the explanations of this kind of thing.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.160]   You see, the scriptures are very realistic, aren't they?
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.560]   This is a very miserable and unhappy picture, but it's here, my friend, this is the sort
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.440]   of thing that can happen in the church at any time, and tends to happen at all times,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:53.160]   especially where the gospel is preached in sincerity and in truth, and we must be aware
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   of this.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   Well, very well.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.640]   Let me show you now, then, what can happen, what is possible to a false believer.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.080]   This is the terrifying thing.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:12.840]   It's shown here all too plainly, then, Simon himself believed also.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   What does that mean?
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.960]   Well, it means that he said that he believed that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.080]   because that is what Philip, you remember, had been preaching.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:31.440]   He preached Christ, he'd preached the name of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.680]   And Philip would never have accepted a man who didn't say that he believed in the Lord
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.000]   Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.480]   We've seen several Sunday nights how this was the very essence of the message, that
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   it was a message concerning this Jesus, whom they said is the Son of God, the message about
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.680]   his virgin birth, about his miracles, about his atoning death, about his burial, about
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:02.080]   his resurrection, his ascension, the descent of the Holy Ghost, the facts, the historical
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   facts.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.380]   Simon believed them all.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.220]   This is what this means.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:18.720]   It means further that he must have accepted and ascented to the way of salvation.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.160]   Philip had expanded it and had explained how the Son of God had come into the world in
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:30.120]   order to be a sin-bearer, that the only way whereby even God can forgive us is that sin
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.840]   be punished, and that he had laid on his own Son the iniquity of us all, and had smitten
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:43.720]   him and had stricken him, and that it is because of that we are pardoned and forgiven and saved
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.480]   and reconciled to God.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.140]   This man expressed his agreement with this.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:55.480]   He believed, as the others had apparently believed.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.800]   Now this is the astounding thing, isn't it, that this is possible to a man who is
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   still not a Christian.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   What is this?
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:09.080]   Well, this is what we call intellectual belief, intellectual ascent to the truth.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:14.820]   Here is a message, and a man of intelligence who takes the trouble to look at it must be
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.200]   impressed by the evidence, and there was plenty of evidence provided for these people by Philip
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.280]   and by what happened to the others, and this man sees all this, and he says, "I believe
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.280]   this."
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Now this is the terrifying thing, but it is very true.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.080]   It is taught in the Scripture itself.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:37.560]   It is possible for a man to give an intellectual ascent to the propositions of the Scripture
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.520]   and still not be a Christian.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:47.900]   Now I am saying this in order that you may see again the honesty of the Scriptures and
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.940]   the honesty of the truly Christian position.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.540]   Christianity is not concerned about our ascent.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:04.920]   It is very concerned about our true deliverance from sin, our true reconciliation unto God.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:13.360]   So it tells us there is this awful danger of a mere intellectual ascent, and that in
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.800]   and of itself does not make us Christians.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.280]   And in the same way, it is possible for us to be aware of feelings within ourselves,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.400]   and many are deluded by feelings.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.580]   Many a man has been moved to tears at the description of the death of the Lord Jesus
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.240]   Christ on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.720]   A preacher can sometimes be responsible for this.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.920]   A preacher can use affecting stories and illustrations and make people weep, and they think that
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.640]   because they weep at these descriptions of the death of the Son of God that they are
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   truly Christian.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.320]   They say, "I was moved by it," and they have wept.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.480]   But oh, how treacherous are feelings!
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.240]   Do you remember the old story that used to be told in this connection?
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.340]   It is such a good one that I repeat it.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:06.600]   It was about a lady who had gone to a theatre here in London one night, and her coachman
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.480]   was sitting outside, and a snowstorm came on.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.680]   She had been in the theatre for three hours, and it was the most affecting drama that she
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   had been watching.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.720]   A man was suffering and had done no wrong, and she was moved to tears, and her heart
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:30.560]   was melted, and oh, she had been broken, as it were, so moved by the drama.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.640]   She came out of the theatre, and there was the poor coachman practically frozen on his
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.320]   seat out in the snow.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:44.800]   Not a word of sympathy, not a word of sorrow, not a word of apology, not a word of concern.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.760]   Just stepped into her coach and was driven home.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.680]   You see, you can be moved emotionally, but if there isn't a content to it, it's of
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.160]   no value.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.960]   And these are the things, unfortunately, that are possible because of our sinful state,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.600]   the deceitfulness of our hearts, and because of the wiles of Satan.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.280]   But you notice something even further.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:18.920]   Simon also himself believed, and when he was baptized—what a prolific cause this is,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.080]   of people imagining that they're Christians when they're not.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.360]   There are many who think that they're Christians because they were baptized, christened when
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.480]   they were children.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.320]   They think that that does it.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.600]   That's a guarantee.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   That makes them Christians.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.920]   Of course, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that explicitly, as do other forms of Catholicism.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.400]   But there are many who hold on to this.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.960]   Baptism makes us Christian.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.480]   "Oh, no, wait a minute," says someone.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.360]   "Of course, I can see this nonsense about infant baptism, but surely if a man is an
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.000]   adult believer and confesses faith, then baptism really does do it.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.880]   He can be certain."
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:04.160]   This man was an adult, and he made a confession of faith, and he was baptized as an adult
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   on confession of faith, and still he is not a Christian.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.400]   No form of baptism makes us Christian, doesn't matter what it is, doesn't matter what age,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.280]   doesn't matter what amount of water.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.920]   These are the things with which the devil deludes us.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.760]   Here is a man believing, baptized, and still is not a Christian.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.880]   Not only that, he joined the Church.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.040]   When he was baptized, he continued with Philip.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.560]   It wasn't a flash in the pen, apparently.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.840]   It wasn't a case of believing, deciding one night, and never being seen again.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.040]   No, no, he went the next day and the next.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.880]   He continued with Philip.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.460]   You can join the Church and still not be a Christian.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:57.240]   Even Philip couldn't detect him, Philip the evangelist, Philip filled with the Spirit.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.320]   He couldn't detect the man.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.960]   He accepted him, he baptized him, he received him into the Church.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.600]   Oh, my dear friends, you may think it's monstrous for a man to be saying things like this at
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.040]   a time like this, when the Christian Church is so small and almost despicable.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.200]   But I say it for this reason.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:21.920]   What matters in the Church is not the numbers, but the purity, the character.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.280]   With God, one is a majority.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:32.600]   It is through a faithful remnant that really is redeemed, regenerated truly in Christ,
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.240]   that God has always done his mighty deeds.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.580]   There is no need for me to cajole or to wheedle people into the Church.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.920]   I would be denying my own gospel that is before me if I attempted to do so.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.200]   No, no, it is for me to show you the dangers, the counterfeit.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.240]   It is to warn you against being misled, to realize that what makes a man a Christian
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:59.560]   is not that he's got a name on a church roll, it's something profounder, more eternal than
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.560]   that.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:07.160]   No, no, you can join the Church and still not be a Christian.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:14.680]   And as I say, you can be interested and amazed, even as this man Simon was.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:23.280]   He continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:31.240]   Now, this is remarkable, isn't it, you see, this man, to all intents and appearances,
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.360]   had become as much of a Christian as all the others.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:40.680]   He would never have been admitted into the Church if he had gone on practicing his sorcery,
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.680]   but he didn't.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.680]   He gave it up.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.400]   There was a change in his life.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.760]   Philip would never have accepted a sorcerer into the Church who continued with his sorcery
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.760]   and with his chicanery.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.200]   Now, the man had given all that up, and he turned his back on it, and here he was regularly
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.720]   in the Church, and he was amazed and astonished at the marvellous things that Philip did,
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:12.280]   and no man seemed to be more appreciative than this man Simon the sorcerer.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:18.320]   And yet, you see, the whole point of the story is to tell us that the man had never been
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.360]   a Christian at all.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.480]   How does this show itself?
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.560]   How can we then decide, says someone, how can we ever know whether it is true or whether
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.560]   it is false?
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:40.080]   Perfectly right is the most important question you can ever ask, and the answer is given
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.920]   here quite simply and quite plainly.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:51.400]   The false always eventually betrays itself.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.680]   Listen to how it's put here.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:59.560]   Here is this man, he turns to Peter and John, and he says, "Give me also this power, that
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:05.600]   on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost."
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:13.260]   And then Peter turns to him, and these are the words he uses, "I perceive that thou
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:18.520]   art in the goal of betterness and in the bond of iniquity."
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.320]   I perceive it.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.920]   I see it.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   How did he see it?
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:30.240]   Well, it was because unbelief, this false, this spurious, always gives itself away.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.000]   And then it becomes evident, it becomes obvious.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.640]   How does it do so?
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.800]   Well, this again is a thing that is taught us in many places in the Scripture.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.720]   Here is a very perfect illustration of it.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:52.120]   It is generally something that happens rather suddenly and unexpectedly, and it is in this
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:59.760]   sudden situation that the poor man who is in a false position betrays himself.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:07.560]   Now our Lord put this, it seems to me, in a word which is recorded at about the end
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:15.080]   of the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, where he said this, "I say
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.880]   unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.880]   day of judgment, for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   be condemned."
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   What does that mean?
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.960]   What it means is this.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:36.160]   What it means by an idle word is a word that you speak without considering.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.600]   And it is out of the heart that a man speaks, out of the fullness of the heart the mouth
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.600]   speaketh.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.480]   It is what a man suddenly says in an emergency when he is confronted by something, he betrays
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   himself.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   Now look at it perfectly here.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.400]   You see, here is a man who to all appearances seems to be a perfectly good Christian.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.560]   Then these two men come down and they lay their hands on these people and they receive
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.920]   the baptism of the Spirit and it is obvious that they have done so, he can see it.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:10.300]   And immediately he blurts out, "I will give you money, let me have this power also."
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:17.360]   And at once he has betrayed the whole of his false and shallow position.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.840]   This idle word, this unpremeditated word, if you had questioned him on his creed he
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.600]   would have given you the right answers, but what he says in an emergency, in a sudden
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.040]   moment, ah, you see the state and the condition of his heart.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.840]   This is the real man now speaking.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.960]   Suddenly it comes out.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:47.240]   And that is something, it seems to me, that is true always in this terrible connection.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:56.920]   It is how we react to various things that happen to us that rarely show where we stand.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.880]   Let me open this a little bit more for you.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.760]   What are the signs of this?
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:08.320]   Well, you see, poor Simon, by speaking like this, he shows quite plainly that he is still
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.240]   the same essential man.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.600]   And that is always the trouble with the false appearance of Christianity.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.260]   The man himself remains the same.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:27.920]   He adds on certain things he believes and he is baptized, he joins the church, he looks
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.680]   on with admiration and wonder, but he is still the same man.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.640]   The nature isn't changed.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:42.040]   Essentially, he is the same man as he was before, how he betrays it.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   How does he show this?
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:49.360]   Well, you see, he shows that he is still worldly minded.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.600]   He is still a profane person.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.840]   Though he says he has believed the gospel and though he has given up his sorcery, the
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   thing that made him practice sorcery is still in him and he wants to do the same thing in
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.600]   a different way.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.160]   Not in sorcery, but in this way.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.840]   This, he says, is similar.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.560]   I had a power, this is a power, and now he still wants power.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:18.920]   The man is unchanged, though he is prepared to manifest the power in a somewhat different
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   way.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:30.560]   So, you see, we've got to test ourselves, not so much by what we say as by the general
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.360]   tenor of our lives.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:41.520]   The way in which we practice even Christianity, I've often put it like this, I've seen
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.080]   men thinking that they were Christians, but it was perfectly clear to me that they'd
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.400]   never been Christians at all.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   Why not?
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.120]   Well, their Christianity was always something that they seemed to be carrying with them
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.960]   in a bag.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.520]   They picked it up on Sunday morning and they were Christians during Sunday, then they put
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.160]   it down Sunday night, meet them during the week, you'd never imagine that they were
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   Christians at all.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.480]   Now, they say the right things, but you see, my friend, that's not Christianity.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:11.840]   Christianity is through and through, Christianity is total, Christianity is in the heart.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.280]   It isn't some addition, it isn't something you take on, and indeed there's something
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   even more terrifying than that.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   It is possible for a man even to be a preacher of this gospel and not to be a Christian.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:30.480]   He can say the right things, he can be orthodox, he can defend the faith, but the man himself
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.560]   may be wrong, and there is such a thing as ambition even in the church, concern about
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:43.640]   offices, positions, dignities, names, appellations, various positions.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.720]   The history of the church demonstrates all of this, and it's a part of my business
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.080]   as a Christian preacher to remind you of this.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.160]   I am not asking you to become a mere part of Christendom.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.520]   I am not asking you to become parts of a great institution.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:04.020]   I am concerned about your souls, and this is the thing I say that matters, not appearances,
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:10.200]   but your relationship to the truth, your knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.040]   There are all sorts of motives that bring people into this connection.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:23.000]   For instance, look at the one we've got here most prominently, interest in phenomena,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.760]   interest in excitement.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.400]   You see, this man, he sees that these two apostles have got this mysterious power.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.640]   They've only to lay their hands on people after praying, and the Holy Ghost falls upon
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.840]   them, and this appeals to him.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.320]   He likes this, he wants this.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.640]   Now, I've known many people like this.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.880]   You know, there are people who want other people's experiences.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.480]   They hear somebody saying, "You know, until a certain point I was very miserable, and
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   I was very unhappy.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.360]   Then I became a Christian, and my unhappiness went, and I've been happy ever since.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.880]   Now I am happy all the day."
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.720]   They say, "That's the very thing I want."
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.560]   They're in trouble, they've had a disappointment, their hearts have been broken, or they fall
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   to some sin.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.480]   They say, "If only I could get that man or that woman's experience!"
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.480]   And they want this!
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   And they say, "Well, how do you get it?"
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ!"
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.760]   They say, "I do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ!"
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.940]   They want this experience.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:21.060]   Don't misunderstand me, my dear friends.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.840]   We should all desire to have forgiveness of sins and to be delivered from our besetting
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.840]   sins.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.080]   But that's a very different thing from coveting somebody else's experience.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:38.460]   No, no, what matters fundamentally is not experience, even.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:45.280]   It is your relationship to him, your understanding, your knowledge of the truth.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.320]   And experiences can be treacherous.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:55.120]   That's where the cults come in again and counterfeit experiences and lead people astray.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.000]   Or it may be that it is a desire, as it was here, to get people's powers and gifts.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.120]   There are men who are out for power, and they don't care how they get it, as long as they've
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.200]   got it.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.400]   And they rather look on at this, and they admire it.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:17.000]   I've known people come to me and say that they feel called to the Christian ministry,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.360]   and I've been able to detect at times that their interest rarely was not in the truth
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.240]   to be preached, but in the preaching.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.740]   In the position of a preacher, a minister, the one who is doing this thing.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:37.080]   What a treacherous thing the human heart is, coveting experiences, coveting power.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   And here it comes out in these men, self-interest was still the main thing governing him, opportunity
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.960]   for self-importance, self-aggrandizement, get people to admire him.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.360]   Oh, what a terrible thing sin is.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.520]   These are some of the ways in which it betrays itself.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.280]   The man speaks, he blurs it out, and he tells you the whole truth about himself, and you
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.120]   perceive that he's never been a Christian at all.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:10.080]   Another way in which you can test yourself is this.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.400]   Are you careless or careful in these matters?
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.880]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.360]   Look at that parable of the foolish virgins.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.560]   Here were ten virgins, five wise, five foolish.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.040]   What was the matter with the foolish virgins?
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.440]   Well, their real trouble was this, wasn't it?
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.960]   They wanted to be in the kingdom of God, they wanted to go to heaven.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.840]   Yes, but, you see, they also wanted to sleep.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.160]   They wanted to get to the kingdom of heaven in their own way.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   They were not careful.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.440]   They were not careful to provide the oil, and so they were careless and they were carefree,
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.360]   and the result was, at the critical moment, they found themselves locked out, with a door
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.740]   shut in their faces.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.640]   It's the whole point of our Lord's speaking, the parable of the ten virgins.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.520]   Of course they wanted to be in, of course they thought they were in.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.040]   They hammered at the door and they said, "Let us in, we belong."
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.480]   The reply was, "You don't belong.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:14.200]   You thought you did, but by your carelessness you gave ample evidence that you never really
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   belonged at all."
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:23.120]   So, a good way of deciding is this.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.320]   It isn't merely what you and I claim to believe, we've got to believe the right things.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.400]   You can't be a Christian without believing an irreducible minimum.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.600]   But what really tests us is this, where does this come in your life?
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.280]   Does this control you?
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.720]   Is this the biggest thing in your life, or is it something that you add on?
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:52.000]   Now in the true Christian, it is always central, it is always controlling.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.400]   The Christian doesn't do the minimum, he's anxious to do the maximum.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:04.600]   He fails, but he's anxious to, whereas the other deliberately always does the minimum.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:14.500]   And then as our Lord points out so clearly in the parable of the sower, the man who thinks
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:21.720]   he's a Christian when he isn't, he soon, soon, soon shows it by allowing the cares
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:28.860]   of this world and the various other things that crop up in life to choke the word.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.160]   You see, they all sprang up, it appeared to be real life, but it wasn't.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.080]   There was only one case in which there was real life, there was an appearance of life
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.040]   in the others, but it wasn't real.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   And how do you tell the difference?
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:46.620]   Well, you see, the cares and the affairs of this world and the deceitfulness of riches
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:50.120]   choke the word.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.440]   And this is another way in which it always betrays itself.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.600]   It doesn't matter what I say, finally it's what I do.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   What are my priorities?
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.600]   What are the things that control me?
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.320]   What are the things that master me?
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.520]   What are the things that count most with me?
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.000]   What are the things that come first with me?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.380]   And then another test which our Lord gives is this, is the way in which I react to persecution.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.500]   Would you like to know whether you're a Christian or not?
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.780]   Here's a very good test.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:31.220]   How do you react when people who know you tend to make fun of you because you're a
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.220]   Christian?
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.460]   You say, "I'm a Christian."
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.460]   Very well.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:41.660]   Do you sometimes try to hide that in order that you may have a good opinion of others,
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.740]   in order that others may praise you, or that in others may not laugh at you?
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.220]   Is it something that you attempt to conceal and hide?
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.660]   You want it, of course, yes, but in your way.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:59.780]   And when persecution arises, says our Lord, it withers and it shrivels up.
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.180]   These are the ways in which we contest.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.700]   And the final way, of course, in which this man, Simon, really gave proof that he'd never
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:12.260]   been a Christian at all was this, was his response to Peter's rebuke.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:19.300]   Peter rebuked him and said, "Pray ye to the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thine heart
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.820]   may be forgiven thee."
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.620]   And you see that phrase, "the thought of thine heart," it brings out all I've been trying
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.620]   to say.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.660]   This is what he planned in his mind, this is how he thought, betraying himself completely.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.020]   But then his response to that is this.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:42.740]   Then answered Simon and said, "Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.220]   which ye have spoken come upon me."
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.880]   What's wrong with that, you say?
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:57.340]   Oh, what's wrong with that is this, that even now he's concerned about the wrong thing.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.980]   What's animating him is fear of punishment.
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:05.500]   He doesn't see the enormity of the thing, he doesn't hate this thing that's in him,
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:10.180]   he doesn't ask, "Oh, how can I be delivered from this deceitful heart of mine?"
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.180]   Not at all.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:17.300]   "Pray for me that I may escape this punishment."
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:24.900]   And that has ever been one of the chief characteristics of this false kind of profession.
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:34.260]   It is a concern mainly not to go to hell, it's not a positive desire to go to heaven.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:39.980]   The real interest is in this world, but we want to avoid the consequences.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:45.860]   There is no hunger and thirst after righteousness, there is no longing for God and for a knowledge
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:46.860]   of God.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:56.260]   No, no, it's a negative fear and a desire to be saved from the consequences of sin or
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.660]   the consequences of a life lived according to nature.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:06.020]   Well, there, my friends, are the things that are revealed to us so clearly in this case
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:10.700]   of Simon the Sorcerer.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.740]   Are you a Christian?
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:19.060]   Are you sure that you're a Christian?
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.420]   Don't just say to me, "I believe," Simon did.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.820]   Don't say, "I've been baptized," he was.
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.580]   Don't say, "I belong to the church," he didn't.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:30.660]   Don't say, "I rather admire these things," so did he.
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:35.140]   Here's the fundamental question.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:39.180]   What is the state of your heart?
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:44.700]   What do you really desire?
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:52.440]   Do you really know that you've got a soul within you that will go on forever?
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.340]   Are you concerned about that soul?
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:02.700]   What's your real interest in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.700]   You say you believe in him.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.060]   Why do you believe in him?
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.020]   Can you give a reason for the hope that is in him?
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:17.620]   These are the questions, and they're very solemn questions.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:25.060]   We are in this world, in this life, once only, never again.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:31.700]   And our eternal destiny is determined in this world and in this life.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:38.500]   And it is all determined by our relationship to this blessed person.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.860]   He's not just a cover for sin.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.340]   He's not just someone that excuses you as you go on with sin.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.500]   No, no.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:56.620]   He preached, one to whom he referred as "Holy Father," the one who had said, "Be ye holy,
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:00.020]   for I am holy."
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:09.940]   Is it your desire to be holy, to belong to God, to be delivered from this life of sin
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:18.860]   and wretchedness and shame, and truly to become a child of God and an heir of everlasting
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:22.700]   and eternal bliss?
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:28.900]   In Simon the Sorcerer, you see the pretense, the sham, the temporary, the false, the thing
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:37.460]   that doesn't count with God, who sees all things, for all things are naked and open,
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:46.300]   unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.820]   What is the real desire of your heart?
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.700]   That's the thing that proclaims what you are.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:57.420]   How I thank God that I can say to you as I close, whatever may be your position, if you
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:05.660]   see it's wrong, it's false, do what Peter said to Simon, repent, go to God acknowledging
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.860]   it and ask him to make it real, to make it true.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.500]   He won't refuse you.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:20.080]   Even to a man like Simon the Sorcerer, betraying this triggery in his heart.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:29.240]   The apostles still say, pray to God, repent, cast yourself upon his mercy.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:38.060]   It's not too late, blessed be the name of God, for so great, so wonderful a salvation,
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:43.560]   that even though we try to fool God and fool ourselves at the same time, even that doesn't
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.560]   cast us out.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:53.800]   If only we repent, if only we acknowledge it and confess it, may God open our eyes and
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:59:02.360]   may he give us all the certainty that we are true believers, born again, born of the Spirit
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:11.600]   of God, and therefore children of God, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.440]   Amen.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
