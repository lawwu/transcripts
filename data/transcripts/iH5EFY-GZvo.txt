[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   So we haven't done a call in a while.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.160]   - Yeah, it's time for a call.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Yeah, let's hear someone's voice.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.140]   - We have Kevin from Minnesota.
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.980]   - Excellent.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.040]   - Basically asking about when's a good time to rest.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.840]   - When you're dead, Kevin.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.680]   - This is Kevin from Minnesota.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.160]   I'm a bit of a writer and a teacher and a learner
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.200]   and love the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.360]   And here is my question.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.360]   I always appreciate how you put hard edges on topics
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.400]   and nuances that help us improve.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.200]   And my question is, how do you know when it's time to rest?
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   And I mean, in terms of the work itself.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.360]   So sometimes you get a little fatigued
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   and whether it's writing or some other piece of work,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.400]   and I don't know whether I should push ahead
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.360]   and get it done, or it's time to just put it aside
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.400]   for a day or two and let it kind of percolate a bit.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.360]   So love to get your nuances.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.040]   And if you will, a little more edge on thinking
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.680]   of the question about how do you know
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.600]   when it's time to stop, pause on something
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.480]   versus push through and get it done.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.320]   Thanks.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.520]   - Well, yeah, Kevin, there's a couple of facets to this.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.400]   So how do you know when to take a break
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.000]   from a particular thing you're working on?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.240]   There's a physical facet.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.940]   So know your body, know your mind.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.360]   I mean, if you're feeling, if you're tired, if you're sick,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.320]   you can just feel that you're not getting traction
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   even that you do your rituals, you get into the work,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.040]   it's time blocked and not much traction's coming on,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.240]   then you need to give your brain a break.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.440]   All right, so I think there's the physical aspect to it.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.120]   There's also the, I would say the non-physical
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   sort of creativity aspect to it.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   I'm not quite sure what the right word to use here.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.700]   So let's just use creativity, which is you feel fine.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.360]   You're not sick, you're not tired,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.700]   but you're not rolling, you're not making traction.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.720]   Like for me, what this looks like
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.400]   with let's say article writing
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.760]   and I have a relevant story that just happened to me,
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.200]   I think it's relevant to this,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   is I feel fine, so I'm working, I'm writing,
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.920]   but it's not gelling.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.640]   It's just I'm going through the motions of like,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.320]   I need to get this done by this point.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.480]   That's my weekly plan
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.860]   that's part of this bigger strategic plan.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.200]   I need to get this article draft done
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.260]   and I'm writing, writing, writing,
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.480]   but I know it's not working.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.360]   And for me, I feel it as a physical unease.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.280]   This is how I am with writing.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.560]   If it's not completely, if it's not working,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.820]   it just doesn't feel right.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.760]   So there's this creativity, cognitive aspect.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.280]   And again, without giving too much details
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.360]   about things in progress,
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   which I always try to be very careful
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.760]   about keeping private,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.960]   I've been working on an article
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.080]   and I was just locked in, like I need to get this done
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.920]   because I have this whole strategic plan
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.840]   of finish it this week
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080]   so I can start on this next week, et cetera.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.520]   I grounded out, I felt fine, so I grounded out
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.920]   and the thing ballooned 7,000 words
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.320]   and it's for a magazine, right?
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.200]   And it just, it wasn't working.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.480]   It just wasn't working, you know?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.580]   And I, at some point I said, okay,
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.000]   I got to pull the rip cord on this,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.960]   take a couple of days off, take a weekend off,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   come back to it fresh.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.120]   I came back to it fresh
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.100]   and hand-grenaded the thing in the fragments,
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.680]   took the fragments I liked, rewrote it from scratch,
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.520]   took me an extra week,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.280]   but it's much closer to where it should be.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.160]   So that's the other fear is like, I have energy,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.760]   but my mind's just not there.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.340]   And there, that's another instance where you say,
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.560]   I need to step back, take a couple of days,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.040]   come back, come back at this fresh.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.880]   And in this case, it was a walk.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.700]   I took two days off and in one walk, 20 minutes long,
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.920]   I just, the structure, the structure fell into place.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.180]   It was like, oh yeah, cut that, cut that, cut that,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.820]   start on this, intertwine this, make that shorter.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.480]   20 minutes, the whole thing was redone.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.060]   But I think without the 48 hours before that 20 minutes,
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.200]   I wouldn't have been able to have the insight.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.960]   So Kevin, that's what I would suggest.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.060]   Physical fatigue, you gotta, you know your body.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.760]   You're not gonna get anything by forcing it through
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.920]   except for more tiredness, prolonged sickness,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.180]   and work you're not proud of,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.020]   but then also creative fatigue.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.180]   Give yourself a couple of days, come at it,
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.660]   come at it fresh.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.660]   All right, so good luck.
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.060]   Good luck with your writing.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.800]   (upbeat music)
