[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   - An anonymous listener of the podcast
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.280]   writes in to ask this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.280]   "what constitutes being a righteous person
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.020]   "as referenced over 50 times in the Psalms?
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.520]   "For example, there are promises to the righteous
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.920]   "that God will hear their prayers."
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.960]   See Psalm 34, verses 15 to 22.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.540]   So who is this righteous person in the Psalms
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.240]   and how do I become one?
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.580]   That's a really important question
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.420]   because of how many people stumble.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.300]   We know we're sinners, we stumble over that
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.580]   and therefore we don't see ourselves in that category
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580]   and therefore we can't make use of those Psalms
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.220]   and that's tragic.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220]   And what makes the question so urgent
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220]   is that when Paul says in Romans 3.10,
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.140]   none is righteous, no not one,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.940]   he's quoting the Psalms.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.780]   - Exactly.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.620]   - Right?
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.820]   - He's like, oh, I don't think the Psalms are right
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.460]   with all that righteousness talk.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.660]   He's quoting Psalm 14 and Psalm 53 says,
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.100]   "God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.760]   "and there are none who understand,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.380]   "there are none who seek for God.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.100]   "They have all fallen away.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.760]   "Together they have become corrupt.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940]   "There is none who does good, not even one."
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.060]   That's the Psalms talking
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060]   who are constantly saying things like this.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.660]   The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.620]   and his ears are toward their cry.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.060]   That's Psalm 34.
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.100]   Psalm 37, "For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.660]   "but the Lord upholds the righteous."
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.160]   Psalm 37 again, "The salvation of the righteous
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.980]   "is from the Lord, he is their stronghold."
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.120]   Psalm 55, "Cast your burden on the Lord,
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.420]   "he will sustain you.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.040]   "He will never permit the righteous to be moved."
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.460]   Can you embrace that promise?
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.580]   That's the key question.
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.440]   Or Psalm 146, "Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.620]   "whose hope is the Lord his God."
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.220]   We are blessed if God is our help.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.580]   And in that Psalm and elsewhere,
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.820]   help comes to the righteous.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.380]   Or Psalm 146, eight, just a couple of verses later,
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.560]   "The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.260]   "The Lord loves the righteous."
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.820]   That's why those two verses together are so powerful.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820]   But here's the catch.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.820]   Immediately before that verse, Psalm 146, verse eight,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.600]   comes a description of who the righteous are.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.660]   And here it is.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.660]   "Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.880]   "whose hope is in the Lord his God,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.340]   "who made heaven and earth, the sea,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.460]   "and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.620]   "who executes justice for the oppressed,
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.060]   "who gives food to the hungry.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.780]   "Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob."
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.220]   He's describing people here doing those things.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.820]   So there's no thought in the Old Testament
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.460]   or the New Testament that the righteous are sinless.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.740]   They aren't sinless.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.340]   The whole Old Covenant is based on the assumption
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.460]   that people need forgiveness
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.820]   through the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament,
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.180]   through the mercy of God.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.180]   The righteous know this and turn to God for mercy,
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.660]   mercy, not merit, mercy,
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.980]   and put their hope in Him for forgiveness.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.540]   And then they live in the promise that God will help them.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.740]   Fear not, I am with you.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.660]   I will help you.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.060]   I will uphold you.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.060]   I'll strengthen you.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.700]   They live in that awareness, and thus they do justice,
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.860]   and they do mercy,
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.780]   and they care for the hungry and the oppressed.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.860]   I have found Psalm 103 to be really helpful
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.700]   in putting the pieces together.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.500]   So it begins celebrating the forgiveness of sin.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.620]   So we can be done with all thought
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.300]   that the righteous don't need their sins forgiven
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.180]   because they don't have any.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.860]   That's not true.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.860]   Verse two, Psalm 103, "Blessed, bless the Lord, O my soul,
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.260]   "and forget not all his benefits,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.780]   "who forgives all your iniquity."
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.420]   Verse 10, "He does not deal with us according to our sins
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.500]   "or repay us according to our iniquities."
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.540]   So the righteous are people who know that,
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.620]   glory in it, base their lives on it.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.540]   And then David adds in verse 17,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.180]   "But the steadfast love of the Lord
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.180]   "is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him,
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.660]   "and His righteousness to children's children,
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.540]   "to those who keep His covenant
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.700]   "and remember to do His commandments."
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   So even though sinlessness is not what righteousness is,
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.140]   and even though forgiveness of sins is continually needed,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.460]   the righteous do keep the covenant.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.020]   They do keep the commandments, not flawlessly.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.380]   But otherwise they wouldn't need any forgiveness.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.780]   But as the passion and the direction of their lives,
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.840]   that's the righteous.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.200]   They're depending on mercy,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.940]   they're getting forgiveness of sins,
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.340]   they're looking away from themselves
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.060]   to the sacrifice that ultimately is Jesus,
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.100]   and they are then in the power and strength of that,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.780]   putting to death sin in their lives,
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.660]   and they're on a basic trajectory of obedience to God.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.140]   And exactly the same thing is true of Christians today.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.140]   The righteous in the New Testament are not sinless people,
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.780]   and they are not only people
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.780]   who are enjoying imputed perfect righteousness,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.580]   as though that's the only way
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.060]   the New Testament talks about the righteous.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.660]   That's the foundational way.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.660]   We can't even make any steps in practical righteousness
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.500]   until we are counted righteous by God through faith alone.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.480]   But once we are justified by faith alone
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.580]   and counted righteous in Christ,
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.900]   our whole lives are devoted to being the righteous.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.680]   And that's why in Philippians 1, verse 11,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.180]   when Paul prays for them,
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.740]   he expects that Christians are going to be found
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.740]   at the last day filled with the fruits of righteousness.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.740]   That is how you keep the new covenant.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.980]   You trust in mercy, you receive forgiveness,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.340]   you enjoy a perfect standing with God,
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.720]   and as the fruit and overflow of the Spirit,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.860]   you bear fruits of righteousness.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.860]   So don't rank, quote, the righteous in the Psalms
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.640]   so high that you can't be one.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.300]   Then those Psalms become useless for you.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.460]   And don't rank the righteous so low
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.460]   that it doesn't require any real moral change in your life.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.820]   That's a wonderful balance and perspective.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.260]   Well, another full week of episodes comes to an end.
