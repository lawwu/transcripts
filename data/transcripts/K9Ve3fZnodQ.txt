[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   "Jesus came to bring violence, to bring a sword.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.040]   So what does that mean for us today?"
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   The question comes in from a listener in Egypt.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.600]   Good morning Pastor John, I'm a devout Christian who reads the Bible every day.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.500]   I struggle with these words of Jesus, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500]   to the earth.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.920]   I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.760]   That's Matthew 10:34.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.080]   I'm wondering what Jesus meant and what does it mean for Christians today.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.360]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.440]   Let's read what Jesus said in the context of Matthew 10, 34 to 39.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.520]   Here's what he said, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.440]   I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.000]   For," it's important to keep reading, "For I have come to set a man against his father,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.960]   and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and a person's
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.240]   enemies will be those of his own household.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.720]   Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.380]   or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.280]   And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.600]   Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.320]   So Jesus talks in this radical, shocking, one-sided way.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.040]   Often he expects us to be startled, awakened, made serious, and then he expects us to put
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.400]   the proper boundaries around what he's saying by remembering what he said elsewhere.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.520]   Like he said, for example, "Blessed are the peacemakers.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.000]   I didn't come to bring peace.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Period.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240]   I'm not going to make war.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.120]   Blessed are the peacemakers, for they should be called the sons of God."
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.400]   And the angel said in Luke 2:14, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.840]   those with whom he's pleased."
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.560]   And Zechariah prophesied in Luke 1:79 that Jesus would give light to those who sit in
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.800]   darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.720]   And James said, "A harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.320]   And Paul said, "Jesus himself is our peace, who has made us both, Jew and Gentile, made
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.480]   us both one and broken down in his flesh, the dividing wall of hostility."
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.400]   And of course, the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   So back to Matthew 10:34, Jesus expects us when he says, "I didn't come to bring peace."
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.720]   He expects us to be shocked, to wake up, to take seriously what he is saying, and not
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.100]   to generalize, to mean things he showed us he doesn't mean.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.680]   He said, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.280]   I have not come to bring peace but a sword."
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:23.240]   And when he says "on earth," his point is to draw attention to his origin in heaven
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.440]   and his mission on earth.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.880]   He's not your ordinary prophet.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.440]   He has come from outside earth, outside the world system, and the message he brings is
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.040]   going to cut.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.280]   Like a sword, peace will not be the all-defining mark of his ministry.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.640]   In other words, those who elevate peace to the all-defining mark—nothing can be done
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.480]   if it doesn't make peace—will go against this text.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   Far from it.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   There will be peace and unity, but not at all costs.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.880]   That's what we're learning from this text.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.520]   Now how will he cut like a sword?
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.320]   So that's the alternative to peace.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.880]   I'm going to be a sword, a cut.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.800]   Well he explains immediately what he's referring to in verse 35.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.520]   And it starts with "for."
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.040]   That's an explanatory foundational text about what I just meant.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.760]   "For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.000]   and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and a person's enemies will be those of his
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   own household."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.200]   Really?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.080]   How will he set family members against each other?
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   Verse 37 explains, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.600]   In other words, Jesus enters earth, enters the world, and he lays claim now.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.520]   As a king from another kingdom, he lays claim on every human heart.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.120]   I am worthy of greater affection, greater love, greater allegiance than any member of
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.600]   your family.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.700]   If all the family members respond to Jesus this way, you've got peace.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.340]   But if they don't, if there is anger because Jesus has become more important than family
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.300]   bonds and family affections, then a sword cuts right through the relationship.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.420]   We've all tasted this in some ways.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.120]   And verse 38 moves the division from superior affections for Jesus, like he says, "You've
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.200]   got to love me more," to absolute following of Jesus.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.020]   So he says, "And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.260]   So the family not only does not have the supreme affection, it does not have supreme authority
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.540]   either.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:06.380]   The disciple loves Jesus above the preciousness of the family, and the disciple follows Jesus
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.780]   before the authority of mother or father.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.080]   This is what Jesus meant by bringing a sword, not peace.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:24.060]   It means he comes into the world as the supreme beauty and supreme joy and supreme value of
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.780]   the universe, and he comes with absolute supreme authority, and therefore he claims in every
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.860]   family and in every business and in every school and in every church and in every political
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:47.820]   party and in every nation, he claims, he lays claim on a superior allegiance, a superior
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.020]   love.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.260]   And so he cuts with the sword of his supremacy.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:00.280]   He cuts every affection and every allegiance to family or business or school or church
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:09.820]   or political party or nation which would compete with him for supreme place in our hearts.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.500]   So because I'm ending here because this is really where the question ended about does
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.460]   it have any relevance for like our day.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.100]   I said, "Whoa, are you kidding me?"
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:26.300]   So while the focus of the text is on family, that's the immediate focus, the application
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.060]   is pervasive.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:36.460]   Jesus has come into the world to disrupt, this is what sword means, to disrupt all human
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.060]   allegiances that don't put him first.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:49.060]   To be loved above all other values and to be followed above all other authorities, fill
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.820]   in the blank, authority in the nation, authority in politics, authority in church, authority
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.020]   in home, authority in business, authority in education, whatever, fill in the blank.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.220]   In other words, this teaching of Jesus is vastly relevant in our day everywhere.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.820]   It sure is.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.180]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that word.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.060]   Well, whether you listen in the car, at the gym, or doing chores, thank you for inviting

[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.940]   churches export it around the world.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.940]   It's still a problem, a problem we need to address, and we will next time on Wednesday.
