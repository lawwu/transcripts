[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Yesterday, we talked about modesty and bikinis, no small topic.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.120]   And today we talk about summer vacations in general.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   The summer vacation season has begun in the United States and a listener named
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600]   Ryan writes in to ask this, Pastor John.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.040]   I'm wondering if you could discuss the theology of vacations.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   You often talk about not wasting your life or any moment or season in it.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   Intellectually, I agree, but at times it just seems like I need to rest.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.480]   Where do vacations fit?
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.920]   Well, you do need a rest and the Bible provides some pretty significant
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.160]   foundations for rest and I think indirectly for vacations.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.120]   And so let me just mention a few of those foundations that I
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040]   think give us some guidance.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.480]   Number one, God created us in need of daily sleep.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   I have always found that quite frustrating.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.560]   I hate sleep.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.640]   I find sleep boring.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   So why did he make me like a helpless baby that must go unconscious one third of my life?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.160]   I mean, just think of it.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.000]   What is the message in that?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.160]   There's got to be a message in that.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.440]   And Psalm 127 says, "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.960]   eating the bread of anxious toil, for he gives to his beloved," some
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.600]   translations say, "in his sleep some sleep."
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   I think the gist in the context is pretty much the same.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.200]   According to this text, sleep is a gift from God and the gift is often
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.960]   spurned by anxious toil.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   Peaceful sleep is the opposite of anxiety.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.600]   God does not want his children to be anxious, but to trust him.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.680]   So I conclude that God made sleep as a continual reminder that we should not be
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.200]   anxious, but should rest in him like a little baby.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   Unless you turn to become like a child, you can't even enter the kingdom.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   He created sleep to make sure we would have a daily reminder.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.480]   We are not God.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.760]   Our work is not decisive in running the world.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   God's work is decisive.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   "He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep," Psalm 121.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.320]   So we sleep.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.000]   God never sleeps.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   So sleep is foundational.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.080]   It's a pointer.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.320]   And I think the big picture there we take away is don't get a big head about your
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   work that you think you can run the world or make everything happen.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.800]   You're like a little baby, a third of your life, and God meant to tell you
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.320]   something. Number two, God established a Sabbath principle.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.200]   However you relate the Old Testament law to the present, the Sabbath remains a
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.320]   gift with wisdom in it.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   I remember reading C.S.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.000]   Lewis's wife's book on the Ten Commandments and seeing her point out the
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.920]   wonder and the glory and the incredible gift of telling an ancient agricultural
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.280]   people whose lives depended on working the land, "Not only don't you have to go
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.320]   to work today, you may not go to work today.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.560]   Mandatory weekly vacation."
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.800]   And it was stunning.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.200]   I mean, I just had never seen it in that light.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.800]   And she said, "That is exactly the way it would have landed on people, at least at
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.520]   the beginning.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.600]   You may not work seven days a week.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.640]   I won't let you.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.680]   You must."
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.280]   And then he consecrated it to himself as a sign of his own creative power and
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.560]   holiness.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:18.520]   But the underlying issue of its gift nature to a worn out, finite, tired
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.800]   agricultural people remains.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.120]   And so I say the rhythm of work six, rest one, work six, rest one, work six, rest
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   one would probably spare a lot of heart attacks and give longevity to many lives
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.760]   prematurely taken because they never unwind the spring.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   They're always working.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.400]   They're working at home and they're working at work and they're working in
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.880]   their play and they can't stop working.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.280]   And I don't think that's what one in seven means.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.840]   This spring that we live by, especially for some of us, it needs to be unwound,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.440]   not just two weeks a year, but one day a week.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.680]   Here's number three, third foundational idea to point towards rest and vacation.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.520]   Work is good and it's not a curse, but it is redeemed.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.360]   So we must work the works of him while it is day.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   Jesus called for work and we ought to work.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.120]   And Paul said, if anyone's not willing to work, let him not eat.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.360]   And I love this verse in first Corinthians 15, be steadfast, immovable, always
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.080]   abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord, your labor is not in vain.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   That means be doing a lot of it, abounding in the work of the Lord.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   And Paul said, don't be weary in doing good.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.360]   So, so here's the rub.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.440]   How do you not grow weary?
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.240]   I mean, he says, don't grow weary in doing good, but we get physically depleted.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.280]   We get mentally depleted, which raises then the question of vacations.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.200]   And here's the last thing I would say.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.440]   God, here's the fourth foundational thing.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.760]   God's son took special times to rest from labor.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.280]   Mark 6 31.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.840]   He said to them, come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.840]   It's interesting that he said that right after these brothers buried the chopped off
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.640]   head of John the Baptist, which meant probably not only did you risk your lives to go get
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.560]   that head or the body, at least, I don't know which they buried.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.520]   They got his body, they buried it.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.480]   You risked your lives.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.920]   This has been a high stress time for you.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   So come away and rest a while.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:52.040]   So my summary would be, it seems that the issue of vacations becomes a matter of wisdom.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.680]   We should try to know ourselves, know our families.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:04.440]   Seems to me that in this fallen age where the focus is on redemption, the final rest
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:12.600]   that we are promised is only tasted incrementally and as a means of more productive
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.000]   labor in this redemptive age.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.520]   Play and recreation in this age is not the main way we glorify God.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.760]   It's secondary, I think, and it's a means of refreshing us and inspiring us for
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.040]   productive labor.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.880]   We work to advance God's saving kingdom in a fallen world.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.240]   And that's true whether we're in secular work or so-called Christian work.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.960]   Vacations and Sabbaths and days off and nights of sleep are recreations of creative,
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.520]   happy, fruitful labor for the advancement of Christ's kingdom in the world, whether
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.160]   you're in a secular work or not.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.760]   And of course, there is no clear line.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.520]   I feel this especially for many of us between vocation and recreation.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:15.960]   Many of us so love what we do and find so much pleasure in it and are so energized by
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:23.240]   it that the concept of taking time for recreation for the sake of creation is not so
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:31.200]   clear. For those folks, we need to make sure that we know not only ourselves, but we
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.400]   need to know those around us, because our wives may not feel the same and our kids may
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.960]   need us when we're just super energized by our reading or our study.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.200]   And that's not what they need at this time.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   And vacations account for that as well as for us.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.960]   That's a good word on vacations and rest.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.040]   And we will return tomorrow.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.360]   Actually, I'll return tomorrow with a weekend conversation.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.040]   We're gonna be talking with someone who has been studying Bible design for several
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.800]   decades, and we're going to talk about a little history of Bible clutter.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.000]   How did our Bibles become such technical books with so many notes and symbols in it?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.680]   It's an interesting story, and it has led to a Bible format that has particular
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.080]   ramifications on how we read and engage the text itself.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.960]   We're going to look at Bible clutter tomorrow.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:24.640]   And for more about this podcast, find us online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
