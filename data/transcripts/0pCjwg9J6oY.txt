[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Tim in San Diego, California writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, do you believe
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   there's a difference between a Christian rap artist and a rap artist who is a
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.600]   Christian? And do you believe that an artist who is a Christian needs to
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.500]   include the gospel into every song that they make?"
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.000]   Well, let's start with that last question, because I think answering that one probably winds up
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.500]   addressing the concerns in the first one, which aren't as easy to answer, because
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.000]   the terms aren't clear. But this one is, "Does the gospel need to be in every song?"
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And if you mean the full enough doctrinal statement of the gospel that the
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   listener would have a reasonable understanding of the gospel and know how
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   to come to Christ, the answer is no. And I say that because Paul accused Peter
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   in Galatians 2 of a kind of behavior that was not in step with the gospel.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So there is the gospel, and there's life in step with the gospel.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   There's the gospel, and there's rap in step with the gospel.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   There's the gospel, and there's music in step with the gospel.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   There's the gospel, and there's advertising for your music group in step with the gospel.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.500]   There's the gospel, and there's the clothing and the attitudes and the tone that's in step with the gospel.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   So it's a more biblical test for a rap song to ask, "Is the message, the tone, the aim, the origin,
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   the spirit, in step with the gospel, rather than does it contain the four or five or six points
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   or steps of the gospel?" If you tried to put a summary of the gospel in every song,
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.000]   it would start to sound stilted. It would be like saying, "Every chapter in the New Testament
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   has to begin the way 1 Corinthians 15 begins. Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500]   that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, that he was buried,
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures."
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   You can't beginâ€”Paul doesn't begin every chapter with that. He expects that what he writes in that chapter
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   will be in step with that, will unpack that, will apply that, but he doesn't feel the need to begin every chapter with that.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   So I think it should be with songs that Christians sing.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:46.000]   When Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2, "I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified,"
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.500]   he did not mean that Christ crucified is mentioned in every chapter of his letters.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.000]   When he said in Galatians 6:14, "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus,"
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.500]   he did not mean you can't exalt in other things like the gifts of Christ or the people of Christ
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   or the work of the saints of God in Christ. He meant, I think, in both those passages,
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   he meant that everything he said, everything he did, everything he sang would be aware.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.000]   "I decided to know," "I decided to know nothing." He would be aware that the good in everything
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and the way everything bad is turned for good was bought for him by Jesus Christ.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500]   Anything good that he experiences was bought for him by Jesus.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   Apart from Christ crucified, he would be hellbound and everything would be taking him there.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   But now, because of Christ, everything is working for his good and God's glory in his life.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   That's what he always boasts in, that that's true in every situation.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   So it shouldn't take too long in listening to a Christian artist like that
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   to know if he or she is blown away by the grace of God in the cross of Christ.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   Their whole ministry should be pointing to the cross of Christ.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   You can call this person a Christian rap artist or a rap artist who is a Christian.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   I don't think that matters. It doesn't matter to me anyway.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.000]   What matters is, is every song in step with the gospel?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Is the artist exulting at every moment in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ in his heart?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.500]   And are the words shaped by that, rooted in that, pointing to that in one way or the other,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   so that the entire corpus of the artist's work is going to point to Jesus and Jesus crucified?
