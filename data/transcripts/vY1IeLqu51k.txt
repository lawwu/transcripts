[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.480]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, episode number
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.680]   seven.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.500]   Today, we have a special guest, Mike Piper,
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.800]   the oblivious investor.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.760]   Mike is an author and a CPA who has written many books.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.120]   And today, we're talking about social security.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:38.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.800]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.520]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.840]   This podcast is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.720]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.520]   Today, my guest is Mike Piper, CPA,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.680]   who is the author of several personal finance books
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   and the blog Oblivious Investor.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.960]   Mike also wrote the Open Social Security Calculator,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.040]   which is a free online tool at opensocialsecurity.com.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.200]   Mike has a lot of great insights for us on social security.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360]   Let's get right to it.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   Please welcome Mike Piper to the Bogleheads on Investing
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.120]   podcast.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.720]   Welcome, Mike.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.240]   Hi, Rick.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.440]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.720]   Well, thanks for being with us.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   I wanted to get you on the show, because you have become
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.600]   the de facto go-to expert on social security
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.400]   with your books, some of your lectures at the Bogleheads
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.760]   meetings, and also your Social Security Calculator, which
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.040]   has become very popular.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.920]   And the best part about it is it's free, which we all like.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.760]   So before we get started, you're a CPA.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.520]   But could you tell us a little bit more about yourself
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.240]   and how you got involved in finance,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.760]   and particularly how you decided to write the Social Security
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.200]   book and do the calculator?
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.160]   So I'm a CPA, like you mentioned.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.840]   My background originally was tax accounting.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.320]   But I haven't done any tax preparation, any client work
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.560]   for, I guess, about 10 years.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.320]   All of my income comes from books.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.080]   I have a series of books on an assortment
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.960]   of financial topics, various tax topics, investing,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.880]   retirement planning, and social security.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.640]   No client work.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.040]   It's just research and writing.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.440]   As far as how I decided to write a book about social security,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.640]   it was just that people asked me to.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.520]   I had written a book about managing an investment
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.200]   portfolio in retirement.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.080]   It's called "Can I Retire?"
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.640]   And I focused exclusively on the investment portfolio
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.360]   side of retirement planning.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.320]   And some people asked me to delve more deeply
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320]   into social security.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.640]   And I figured that's the thing I could probably do,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.120]   given my background in taxation.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.280]   I are pretty comfortable reading legalese
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.320]   and figuring out what it means.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.800]   And that's basically what social security research is.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.200]   That's how I got into social security in the first place,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.280]   was writing that book at the request of readers.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.000]   About a year ago, I started working on this calculator.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.320]   And it's been released and available
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.200]   for six or seven months.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.400]   And how I got into that was completely accidentally.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.920]   My wife recently changed careers.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.320]   She became a software developer.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.640]   And I just was interested in having a better understanding
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.520]   of what she does.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.280]   So I learned a little bit about programming,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.360]   about writing code.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.720]   And it seemed like a natural way to put that to use,
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.760]   given my social security background.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.560]   Well, I personally have used the calculator.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.480]   And it works great.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I appreciate you doing that work.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.920]   And we'll get to some of the aspects of that calculator
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920]   a little bit later on.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.640]   But I just want to reiterate one thing.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   You said you don't take any clients that--
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.840]   I can't call you up and pay you to help me.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.680]   Is that true?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.320]   That's correct.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.640]   I'm happy to answer questions.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.960]   But no, I do not do any client work at all.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.840]   Let's go ahead, then, and start our discussion
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.880]   about social security.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   But before we get into the nitty gritty of it,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.880]   I was reading a lot about how we actually
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.360]   got a social security program to begin with.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.280]   And it goes way back to Civil War days,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.440]   and even prior to that.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.880]   Can you give us a little history of what social security
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.080]   was supposed to be for, and what it has become over the last,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.880]   say--
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.040]   well, it's only been around since 1935.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.600]   So that would give us about 85 years.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.100]   Exactly.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.840]   The Social Security Act was originally passed in 1935.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.480]   And of all the different types of benefits that we have now,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.560]   the only major one that was available then
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480]   was just plain old retirement benefits.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.800]   There were no spousal benefits, no survivor benefits,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.840]   no child benefits, no disability benefits, none of those things.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.960]   The spousal benefits for wives, and survivor benefits
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.520]   for widows, as well as child benefits,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.840]   came a few years later, 1939.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080]   And then they extended those same benefits--
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.840]   so spousal benefits for husbands.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.920]   And widower benefits came in 1950, so a little bit more
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.160]   than 10 years later.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.000]   Disability benefits in 1956.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.200]   So the program expanded pretty dramatically
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.040]   in the first 20 years, adding on all these different types
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.960]   of benefits.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.760]   And then, as far as major changes since then,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   there's been several.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.280]   The automatic inflation adjustments,
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.240]   those began in 1972.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.560]   The increase for full retirement age happened in 1983.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.600]   It's a program that's really evolved over time
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.560]   and continues to evolve.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.320]   Just a few years ago, we had another change
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   in terms of restricted applications
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.320]   and voluntary suspension rules.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.480]   It's changed over time.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.240]   And it will certainly continue to change in the future.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.600]   I was reading that the very first person
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.960]   to receive a Social Security benefit
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.640]   was a Cleveland motor man by the name of Ernest Ackerman, who
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.680]   had put one nickel out of his pay
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   into the Social Security system and received a payment back
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.520]   when he retired of $0.17.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.440]   So we've come a long way in the last 85 years.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.600]   Mike, let's talk about your book, Social Security
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.680]   Made Simple.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.600]   You wrote this book to explain Social Security
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.440]   in 100 pages or less.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.720]   Is that possible to do?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.880]   Not every single possible rule, with all the exceptions
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.000]   to the rules.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.480]   But most of the information that most people need to know,
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.560]   I think, is explained and hopefully explained clearly
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.680]   in that book.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.240]   Let's go through some of, let's say,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.400]   the top 10 things people need to know about Social Security.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.840]   And this would be people who are just starting work,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.240]   people who have been in the workforce for a while,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.280]   people like me who are in their early 60s, who are looking at,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.320]   gee, when should I take Social Security?
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.720]   Step by step, go through some of the major portions of your book
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.200]   and talk about some of these topics.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.120]   First thing to know is that the amount
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.320]   that you get as a retirement benefit
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.400]   is based on two things.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.520]   Number one is your earnings history,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.640]   so how many years of earnings you have
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   and how much you earn per year.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.440]   And number two is how old you are
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.080]   when you begin taking your benefit.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   So as far as the earnings that they look at,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.760]   the way the calculation works is they
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.600]   look at all of your years of earnings
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.000]   and they adjust years prior to age 60.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.560]   They adjust them upward for, essentially, wage inflation.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.280]   Essentially, it's the growth in the national average wage
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.640]   that they're using to adjust it upward.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.400]   And then out of all of those years,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.880]   they pick the 35 highest.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.160]   And from there, they calculate something
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.640]   called your average indexed monthly earnings, which
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.400]   is sort of just the average monthly amount out
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.240]   of those 35 wage inflation adjusted years.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.600]   And from there, they calculate something
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.360]   called your primary insurance amount.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.760]   And this is-- of all of the Social Security jargon,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.320]   this is the one term that you really
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.440]   need to know what it means.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.400]   And it's primary insurance amount.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   And it is the amount of your monthly retirement benefit
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.560]   if you file for your benefit exactly
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.720]   at your full retirement age.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.080]   And it's a function of your earnings history.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.520]   The higher your earnings, the higher your primary insurance
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.320]   amount.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.720]   You mentioned full retirement age.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.480]   How is that calculated?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.720]   For anybody born 1943 to 1954, you
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.600]   have a full retirement age of 66.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.440]   And then for people born between 1955 and 1959,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.080]   it's basically between 66 and 67.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   And then for anybody born 1960 or later,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.560]   you have a full retirement age of 67.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.720]   You said that they take the average of the highest 35
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.520]   years.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.120]   What if you don't have 35 years?
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.960]   What if you have 20 years or 10 years or just five years?
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.080]   Sure.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   Good question.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.720]   So if you only have five years, you're
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.360]   not actually going to qualify for a retirement
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.520]   benefit in the first place because you
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.040]   need at least 10 years.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.840]   But if you have, let's say, 20 years, then they fill in zeros
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.880]   to get you up to 35.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.840]   So they'll look at your 20 years of earnings,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.920]   and then they'll be using 15 years of zeros.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.640]   So definitely having 35 years of earnings
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.000]   will certainly help you to qualify for a larger benefit.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.760]   What if you only have, say, eight years?
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   You don't qualify.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   What happens to all the money you put in?
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.160]   Well, you don't get anything, the short version.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.760]   In most cases--
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   You've donated to the cause.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.720]   In cases where you only have eight years of earnings,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.240]   potentially it's because the most common situation
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.200]   is that likely either A, you became disabled,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.800]   in which case you can qualify for benefits with less than 10
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.880]   years of earnings, or maybe you spent a lot of years
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.040]   out of the workforce taking care of children.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.120]   So it's likely that you're married or were married.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.840]   So you may qualify for spousal benefits or survivor benefits
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.600]   on your spouse's work record.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.480]   I've always had a question of, where does that money come from?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:56.640]   If I worked and my wife didn't work, so I put in for me,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.520]   but I never put in anything extra for her,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.160]   when she starts getting paid half of my Social Security
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.200]   at some point, where does that money come from?
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.480]   I didn't put it in.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.200]   Yeah, the system is not designed to be a retirement account,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:14.840]   essentially.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.160]   It's not designed to have what you would call--
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.920]   or what many people would call fair outcomes based on,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.240]   this person put in x dollars, and this other person
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.080]   put in y dollars.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.640]   So the amount they're going to get out
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.160]   is based on exactly what they put in.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.840]   That's not how it works.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.360]   If you've got two people who have exactly identical earnings
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.680]   history, one of them never got married,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.200]   and the other was married.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.680]   And so one of them is going to have a spouse collecting
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.680]   benefits on their work record.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.480]   Well, the two people put in the same amount,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.880]   but one of those families is going to be getting more out.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.920]   And the same could be said just based on,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.800]   let's say you pay in for your entire career,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.880]   and then you had a heart attack and died at age 60.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.760]   You didn't get anything out then, either.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.400]   So it's really not designed, even
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.240]   with the intention of working like a retirement account,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.080]   where the amount you put in and the amount you eventually
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.440]   get out are necessarily supposed to be proportional.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.120]   It's more about taking care of people
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.040]   when they're most in need, is roughly what Social Security
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.480]   is designed to do.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.720]   So really, it is an insurance program rather than
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.360]   a retirement program.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.220]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.320]   It's a social insurance program.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.280]   That's precisely what it is.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.600]   I think that that's really important for all of us
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.000]   who are paying in or taking out to understand
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.960]   that we often talk about Social Security retirement
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.880]   pay or the money we're going to get
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.640]   in Social Security in retirement.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.760]   But it's really not a retirement pay.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.040]   And the reason why all these quirky rules and regulations
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.280]   exist--
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.480]   and as you said, it may seem inequal
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.280]   that why would my wife, who doesn't have 10 years of work
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.440]   because she stayed home with the kids, why should she get pay?
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.560]   Why should I get 1 and 1/2 times my Social Security benefit
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.400]   when I never put the money in?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.720]   It's just because that's what the insurance program says.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.860]   And therefore, that's what happens.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.640]   And there's no equality to it, as you said.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.880]   Which is interesting.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.760]   I think it's an aspect of Social Security
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.600]   that a lot of people don't really understand.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.400]   Yeah, I think a related point, a lot of people
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.240]   look at the money they're putting in,
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.200]   and they compare it to the money that they ultimately get out.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.920]   But what they miss is that a big chunk of what you're paying
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.140]   is not just going to retirement benefits.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.100]   You're also essentially getting a life insurance
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.640]   policy and a disability insurance
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   policy while you're working.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.400]   And a lot of people don't recognize
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.520]   that part of the taxes that they're paying
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.440]   goes towards that as well.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.840]   On the disability side, you said you don't need 10 years
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.720]   to collect a disability Social Security benefit.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.040]   How many years do you need?
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.400]   It depends on how old you are when you become disabled,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.280]   basically.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.600]   There's a calculation I don't remember, honestly,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.480]   off the top of my head.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.920]   So we've talked about how your benefit is calculated
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.720]   at your full retirement age.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.360]   But if you don't take your benefit at full retirement age,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.160]   if you take it before or after, that also affects your benefit.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.360]   Exactly.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.000]   If you file for your retirement benefit
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.560]   before full retirement age, you get
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.760]   less than your primary insurance amount.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.400]   And if you file after your retirement age,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.640]   you get more than your primary insurance amount.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.840]   And the math works based on months.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.880]   So every month that you wait, you get a little bit more
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.480]   than if you had filed the month before.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.680]   If you want to look at it from a year's perspective,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.120]   for somebody who files four years
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.040]   before their full retirement age, for instance,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.160]   they would get 75% of their primary insurance amount.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.920]   Somebody who filed two years before their full retirement
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.800]   age would get a little under 87% of their primary insurance
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.520]   amount.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.160]   Somebody two years after full retirement age gets 116%.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.200]   Somebody four years after their full retirement age gets 132%.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.280]   The longer you wait, the more you get.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.800]   And roughly speaking, somebody waiting all the way
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.320]   until age 70 to file will get about 75% more
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.760]   than somebody who files as early as they can in '62.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.560]   And that all sounds great, except there's
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.000]   a couple of issues with that.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.640]   And you just recently wrote an article
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.480]   about this in your Oblivious Investor blog.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.920]   Great blog, by the way.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.200]   You do a great job with that.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.000]   And that is that--
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.320]   Thank you.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.360]   --this extra money that you're getting,
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.800]   there's a couple of things that are happening.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.520]   Number one, you're getting a year older,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.320]   you're getting one year closer to death.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.040]   Right.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.320]   So you're not going to collect it as long,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.280]   even though you're collecting more.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.880]   And the other aspect of it is, if you collect it early,
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.120]   you could take the money, and you could invest it,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.800]   and you could make money on the money.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.000]   And let's say you just make a 4% return, you're not really--
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.560]   I mean, what's the breakeven point?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.120]   I mean, how does it all mesh out?
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.320]   Well, it depends on if you're married or not.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.760]   Because if you are married, we have
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.240]   to be thinking about survivor benefits, rather than just
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.280]   retirement benefits.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.120]   But in the simplest situation, so somebody who isn't married
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.440]   and we're only looking at one person's retirement benefit
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.160]   and one person's life expectancy,
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.080]   if you compare filing at 62 versus filing at 70,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:20.560]   if the person lives to age 80, then those two filing choices
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.280]   are basically the same, if they earned a return that
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.440]   exactly matches inflation.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.720]   It's actually 80 and 1/2, 80 and 6 months.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.280]   And the higher the return you get earned,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.560]   the further the breakeven age is pushed out
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.400]   into the future, basically.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.040]   I think, though, one mistake that a lot of people make
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.000]   is that the rate of return that they're assuming
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.800]   or that they're using for this analysis
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.880]   is too high, because generally speaking,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.280]   when we're talking about delaying social security,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.960]   so spending down your portfolio to delay social security,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.880]   we're not talking about spending down your portfolio overall.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.520]   We're talking about specifically spending down
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.240]   your bond portfolio.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.520]   You're essentially exchanging bond holdings
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.240]   to one fixed income holding for more social security.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.720]   And that's what has, in most cases,
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.560]   a very advantageous outcome.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.440]   Not every case, but in a majority of cases.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.960]   So let me understand this correctly.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.480]   You're really now looking at social security
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.440]   as a bond holding in your portfolio,
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.960]   or at least has similar characteristics.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.720]   So if you're not going to take social security early,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.600]   if you're going to delay, then on your portfolio side,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.080]   your stock and bond, your investment portfolio,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.720]   you would be taking your money out of the bond side
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.960]   and spending that, because the social security
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.720]   portion, which is like a bond, although it's not exactly
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.120]   a bond, will be increasing in value.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.440]   Is that what I understand you saying?
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.360]   What I'm saying here is that when
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.600]   you're delaying social security, or even more broadly,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.160]   when you're annuitizing, you usually
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.880]   want to do it by using your fixed income
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.560]   holdings to buy that annuity, or in this case,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.600]   to buy more social security, essentially.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.560]   Because that's what we're looking at doing.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.360]   That's the analysis that we're making here,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.160]   how to spend down by bonds to get more social security.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.840]   The rate of return you want to use in your analysis
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.120]   is the rate of return that you would expect from your bond
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.880]   holdings.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.440]   The rate of return that I usually use
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.240]   is 20-year tips, because that's the thing that's
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   most comparable to social security,
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.320]   and that it's inflation-adjusted backed
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.400]   by the federal government.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.600]   And it has a duration in the rough ballpark
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.200]   of what a social security annuity would have.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.360]   And that's the discount rate that's
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.240]   used by default when you load the calculator.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.840]   You can adjust the discount rate if you want to.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.280]   And a lot of people make this mistake of using--
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.520]   they say, oh, well, I can take the money and invest it
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.600]   and get a 4% return, so I'm going to take the money
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.480]   and invest it.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.240]   Well, OK, fine.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.920]   But again, you have the option.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.760]   You don't have to be spending down your stockholding
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.800]   to delay social security.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.920]   You could be spending down your bonds.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.960]   And in most cases, that's what makes sense to do.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.920]   So that's the analysis that we're usually looking at.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.160]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.960]   It's a really great way of looking at it.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.760]   I hadn't really thought about it that way,
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.200]   but it makes complete sense to do it.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.320]   Let me throw one more zinger in there,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.280]   that how does your health work into all of this?
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   In other words, my parents are still alive.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.600]   And my father is 90, and my mother is in her late 80s.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.760]   They're not going anywhere.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.160]   They're basically, unfortunately,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.080]   bound to a small apartment where they're living.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.240]   And my father is not going anywhere.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.840]   So even though they might be making more money
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.440]   because my father delayed taking social security until he
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.200]   was 70 years old, the fact is he can't spend it now.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   So doesn't a quality of life also come into this equation?
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:55.720]   Sure.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.000]   So there's a lot going on with that question.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.160]   Number one is life expectancy.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.080]   Again, we're still just talking about the simplest case
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.360]   here of a non-married person, because we
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.160]   haven't talked about how survivor benefits work yet.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.240]   So for a non-married person, the longer their life expectancy,
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.120]   the more advantageous it is to delay.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.720]   And the shorter their life expectancy,
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.200]   the more advantageous it is to file early.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.800]   For a married couple, it's different,
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.480]   because we have to look at joint life expectancies.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.320]   This is a bit of a simplification.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.200]   But roughly speaking, the way survivor benefits work
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.600]   is that after one spouse dies, the spouse who's still alive,
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.880]   the amount that they get from that point forward
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.360]   is roughly, in most cases, the amount--
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.960]   whichever person had the higher benefit at that point,
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.440]   that amount is what the spouse who's still alive
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.600]   is going to continue getting from that point forward.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.920]   And again, that's a bit of a simplification,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.480]   but that's roughly how it works.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.520]   With regard to the when to file decision for a married couple,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   for the higher-earning spouse, when
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.760]   they delay taking benefits, it increases the amount
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.800]   that the couple gets as long as either person is still alive.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.120]   So what we need to look at there is a joint life expectancy.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.440]   And specifically, it's the couple's joint second-to-die
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.000]   life expectancy.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.480]   And conversely, for the lower-earning spouse,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.280]   when they delay claiming benefits,
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.160]   it only increases the amount that the couple's
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.320]   going to receive as long as both people are still alive.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.640]   So now we need to look at a joint life expectancy that's
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.520]   actually the couple's joint first-to-die life
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.880]   expectancy, which is shorter.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.720]   And so the way that works out in terms of optimal filing
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.120]   strategies is that it's usually advantageous for the higher-earning
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   spouse to wait until 70, and it's often but not always
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.760]   advantageous for the lower-earning spouse
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.400]   to file early.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.800]   Micah, all this sounds great, but I'm not
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.400]   going to remember any of--
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   well, maybe 10% of it.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.360]   So I just want to find out from you,
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.200]   if I used your open social security calculator online
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.280]   and I put all my data in, this is what it does for me,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:05.800]   correct?
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.240]   It helps me figure this out?
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.120]   Yeah, that's what it's doing.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.520]   By default, it uses the Social Security Administration's life
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.080]   expectancy mortality tables.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.120]   But you can select different mortality tables
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.680]   if you're in better than average or worse than average health.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.720]   And it essentially looks at all of the different possible
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.160]   claiming ages for you.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.720]   And if you're married, it looks at all
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.880]   of the combinations of claiming ages for you and your spouse.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.480]   And it determines which one is expected
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.000]   to provide the highest total level of spending
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.440]   over your retirement.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.400]   And then after that, you can say, OK,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.600]   so the calculator suggested filing, let's say,
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.560]   at age 70 for me and at age 63 and seven months for my spouse.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   What if instead I filed at 67 and my spouse filed at 65?
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.120]   How does that work out?
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.160]   And it tells you the total amount
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.080]   of spending that Social Security would
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.960]   be expected to fund over your lifetimes
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.400]   with that set of filing ages.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.240]   So you can see how different it is.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.640]   And in some cases, what you'll find
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.680]   is that there are an assortment of combinations
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.200]   that work out fairly similarly.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.840]   They're about as good as each other.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.080]   And then there are claiming ages that are quite a bit worse.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.360]   And so Social Security planning is not necessarily
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.200]   about picking the very best one, because the very best one
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.520]   and the next best one are usually
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.920]   about the same as each other, but not that different.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.440]   It's about avoiding the really bad decisions.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.840]   John Bogle always said, you got to get the big things right.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.520]   Don't make big mistakes.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.480]   So your calculator will avoid big mistakes.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.840]   And even if you're not absolutely perfect,
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.680]   you're generally getting it right.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.880]   And so you've done well.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.040]   Let me ask a question about inflation.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.080]   So Social Security is adjusted for inflation every year.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:08.000]   Unless there's deflation, which is a lowering of prices.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   And then Social Security is not adjusted down.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.400]   So could you talk about inflation and Social Security
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.680]   payments?
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.720]   Every year, beginning at age 62, your primary insurance amount
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.120]   is adjusted upward based on inflation.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.920]   And because your monthly benefit amount
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.600]   is a percentage of your primary insurance amount, what
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.320]   that means is that your monthly benefit amount is going upward
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.560]   based on inflation every year.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.520]   And that's true regardless of when you do or don't file.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.960]   So something a lot of people ask is, if I wait until 70
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.160]   or if I wait until 68, do I miss out
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.840]   on those inflation adjustments?
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.080]   No, you don't miss out on them at all.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.400]   The inflation investment starts at age 62,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.680]   regardless of the age at which you file.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.720]   A lot of people also say, there's
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.680]   also inflation in part B of my Medicare and so forth, though.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.320]   It seems-- one Boglehead wrote in.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.200]   He said, it seems as though whatever extra I
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.080]   get in Social Security just turns over--
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.560]   I just turn it over to Medicare because I have
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   to pay higher premiums there.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.760]   I know this isn't a discussion about Medicare,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.880]   but is it comparable?
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.360]   I mean, is that about what happens?
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.400]   Well, it's going to vary depending
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.560]   on the size of the person's retirement benefit
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.240]   because the larger their retirement benefit is,
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.600]   the larger the dollar amount of inflation adjustment
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.760]   that they'll get every year.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.720]   The amount of your Medicare premium
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.600]   varies based on your income level.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.680]   So it's going to vary from one person to another.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.760]   But it is true, of course, that health care costs
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.120]   tend to rise at a rate that's quite a bit faster than prices
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.360]   in general, so faster than overall rate of inflation.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Yes, it's often true that the increase in Medicare premium
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.760]   that you're going to see is going
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.640]   to take a big chunk out of the Social Security inflation
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.800]   adjustment that you would get.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.360]   I went back earlier this year, and I
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.320]   looked at how the government uses
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.000]   inflation of various things to determine levels.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.160]   For example, how much of your earnings,
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.200]   the dollar amount of your earnings,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   do you have to pay--
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.600]   well, you have to pay into Social Security.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.520]   I don't know what the level is right now, but maybe you do.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.120]   What is the dollar amount?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.800]   In other words, I make $120,000 a year.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.640]   How much of that do I have to pay into Social Security?
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.400]   Oh, the maximum taxable earnings?
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.200]   Yes.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.360]   For 2019, it's $132,900 is the maximum amount
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.400]   of your earnings that would be taxable under Social Security
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   tax.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.960]   But this figure is one that is adjusted not
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.840]   based on price inflation, but based on, essentially,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.600]   wage inflation, so increases in the national average wage.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.160]   Yeah, I find it funny that that goes up,
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.840]   it seems, faster than the benefit goes up.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.160]   So government uses different numbers.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.840]   I'm a military retiree, and they use yet a different number
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.000]   for determining my increase in my military pension.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.520]   So you've got this maximum amount
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.600]   that's taxed for Social Security, 132, which goes up,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.720]   seems to be like 6% a year.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.400]   And then you've got Social Security,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.280]   which goes up by something else.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.200]   And then you've got my military pension,
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.840]   which goes up by something else.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   So it's just interesting that the government uses
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.960]   all these different numbers for inflation.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.520]   Yes, it is true that generally, over an extended period
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.360]   of time, average wages will grow by a faster rate than prices.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.640]   So yes, the rate at which the maximum taxable earnings grows
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.800]   will usually outpace the rate at which benefit amounts will grow.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.760]   And I suppose that this is a way of keeping the system solvent,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.520]   which, by the way, I do have a question on.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   And let's get to that right now.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.240]   A lot of people on the Bogleheads forum,
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.120]   when I announced that I was going
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.920]   to be talking with you and interviewing you
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.960]   and asked the Bogleheads to submit their questions,
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.400]   there was a few people who submitted a question asking
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.160]   about the solvency of the whole Social Security program.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.480]   Could you address your thoughts on the solvency
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.320]   of Social Security, say, over the next 50 years?
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.720]   The fundamental source to look at here
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.320]   is the trustees report.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.600]   So the Social Security trustees put out an annual report
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.040]   that speaks in a fair bit of depth to this issue.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.520]   And with regard to what they call the Old Age and Survivors
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.680]   Insurance Trust Fund, which is the trust fund that
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.080]   pays for retirement benefits and widow and widower benefits,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.640]   it has a projected depletion date of 2034.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.760]   Then after that, what a lot of people think--
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.200]   I see this all the time, especially among younger people.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.160]   They think that Social Security is going away.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.720]   And it's not going to go away.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.480]   Because when that trust fund is depleted,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.200]   taxes are still expected to be able to cover about 77%
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.000]   of promised benefits.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.840]   So even if no legislation was passed at all
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.040]   to improve the funding status of the program,
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:22.440]   we end up seeing a cut in benefits that's about 23% in 2034.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.120]   Of course, that's not exactly the most likely scenario.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.880]   More likely will be some sort of changes before then,
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.640]   which are probably going to be a combination of tax increases
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.440]   and benefit cuts, rather than nothing happening at all.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.520]   And then all of a sudden, on one day,
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.240]   we see a big cut in benefits.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.780]   It's much more likely, I would assume,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.280]   that we see a combined sort of solution here.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.200]   It's all math, though.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.240]   I was listening to Alan Greenspan
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.000]   speak at a conference.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.480]   And he was saying that the Social Security system could
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.560]   be solved in 15 minutes.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.880]   Because it's just all math.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.920]   He said Medicare.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.760]   Medicare is a much more difficult problem
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.960]   that we have in this country.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.560]   Health care prices, there's a lot
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.080]   going into that in terms of unknowns.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.920]   And it's much harder to control.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.160]   Whereas Social Security, not only is it just math,
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.060]   it's math where we know the numbers.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.000]   I mean, we know about how long people live, on average.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.320]   And we know exactly how many people
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.200]   there are who are currently age 60.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.560]   And we know how many people there
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.320]   are who are currently age 59.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.900]   So we can figure out, fairly precisely,
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.400]   how much the trust fund will have to pay out every year.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.000]   It's more of an estimate how much it'll
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.400]   be taking in every year, of course,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.080]   because we don't know exactly what earnings are going
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.640]   to look like.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.840]   That depends on how well the economy does.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.200]   But yeah, we have a very, very good estimate here.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.760]   The projections-- so like I said,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.440]   I put out this trustees report every year.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.840]   And it doesn't change that much from one year to the next.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.280]   Because the projection is basically bearing out
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.240]   according to plan.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.340]   Things are basically-- their projection
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.120]   is proving to be true so far.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.800]   So they don't need to adjust it very much
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.320]   from one year to the next.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.400]   Mike, I'd like to circle back to the quality of life question.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.000]   And I talked about my parents who
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.840]   are basically unable to travel and unable to do very much
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.680]   right now because my father is in his 90s and really immobile.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.720]   How do you look at quality of life issues
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.280]   as far as the decision as to when to take Social Security,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.680]   whether to delay or not delay?
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   Yeah, this is something that comes up a lot.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.600]   A lot of people say that they want
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.760]   to spend more in early retirement
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.880]   rather than late retirement because they'll
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.360]   be able to enjoy it more in the early years
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.280]   because they can travel and so on.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.880]   And that makes a lot of sense for many people, of course.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.560]   What a lot of people don't understand,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.120]   though, is that in many cases--
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.760]   and this is not every case-- but in many cases,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.400]   the plan that allows you to spend
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.080]   the most in early retirement is still delaying Social Security
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.520]   because if delaying Social Security allows
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.920]   you to spend more over the course of your whole lifetime,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.000]   you can choose when you do that spending.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.960]   You can spend more earlier because you
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.280]   can spend more overall.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.880]   Essentially, what you're doing is just
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.120]   spending down your portfolio at a faster rate.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.000]   And that's OK because--
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.040]   or I'm sorry, you're spending down your portfolio
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.120]   at a faster rate in early retirement.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.600]   And that's OK because then once Social Security does
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.280]   kick in at this later age and at this higher amount,
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.520]   the rate at which you're spending from your portfolio
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.480]   will decline.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.320]   So even in many cases where the person
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.400]   wants to spend more early in retirement,
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.960]   delaying Social Security is still the best option,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.640]   especially in particular for the higher earner
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.600]   in a married couple or for an unmarried person.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.400]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.640]   You just threw a whole monkey wrench
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:57.480]   into this thing called the 4% rule, which basically says
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:03.360]   you've got to save x amount of dollars where you can draw 4%
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.960]   off of that indefinitely for the rest of your life.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.400]   What you're talking about, your strategy,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.800]   where you're incorporating Social Security into this,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.240]   just threw a whole big monkey wrench into that.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.480]   Yeah, it does.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.680]   It definitely, definitely does.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.440]   Vernon, Joe Tomlinson, and Wade Fowle
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.360]   released a piece of research, I guess maybe the beginning
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.080]   of 2018 or maybe the end of 2017,
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.520]   that talked about a strategy that I think
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.600]   makes quite a bit more sense.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.040]   And it's basically, if you are planning
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.960]   to delay Social Security, then figure out
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.120]   the amount of Social Security that you're giving up
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.200]   in the meantime, basically.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.960]   And carve out a piece of your portfolio
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.160]   that's equal to that chunk of money
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.680]   and basically keep it in something very safe.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.760]   And you're going to be spending that down
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.040]   to delay Social Security.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.920]   And again, that's what we talked about.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.640]   You're basically spending down your bonds
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.760]   while you delay Social Security.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.880]   And then from the rest of the portfolio--
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.560]   so the rest of the portfolio is where
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.680]   you're going to be spending a roughly equal amount
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.240]   through the course of your retirement.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.040]   That's where the 4% or 3-point-whatever-percent
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.480]   spending rules can be applied.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.440]   And that's where you're going to use a more typical balanced
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.280]   stock bond allocation.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.400]   That makes too much sense, Mike.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.520]   Those are great, great, great concepts.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.000]   And give me the name of that paper again.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.440]   So the name of the paper is "Optimizing Retirement Income
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.960]   by Integrating Retirement Plans, IRAs, and Home Equity."
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.280]   And the authors are Wade Fowle, Joe Tomlinson,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.760]   and Steve Vernon.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.960]   And where would be able to find that paper?
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.720]   The website where I see it is stanford.edu.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.480]   I'm sure if you Google the name of the paper and the authors,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.360]   it would come up.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.400]   Great.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.920]   Let's switch topics here and talk about application
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   strategies.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.840]   And a lot of people thought that changes a couple of years ago
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.480]   took out a few of these strategies,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.520]   like file and suspend, and they're no longer valid.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.320]   Can you talk about what that was, and what happened to it,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.560]   and what people might be able to do as an alternative?
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.920]   The file and suspend strategy was kind of weird,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.480]   but it became the famous one, because it wasn't actually
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.600]   that useful for very many people.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.560]   The one that was useful for a lot more people
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.960]   was the restricted application strategy.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.040]   And hardly anybody has heard of a restricted application
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.720]   unless you've done quite a lot of reading
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.120]   about Social Security.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.320]   And what a restricted application is,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.800]   that's where, at your full retirement age,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.360]   you file for spousal benefits, but only spousal benefits.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.680]   And you let your own retirement benefit
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.600]   continue growing until age 70.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.400]   OK, let me stop you for a second there.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.920]   I just want to make sure I understand.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.640]   Is it at my full retirement age, or is it
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.320]   at my wife's full retirement age?
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:07.680]   When would I file this restricted application?
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.120]   The requirement is that you have to have reached
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.000]   your full retirement age, and your spouse
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.440]   has to have started their retirement benefit.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   And then you can file an application
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.280]   for just spousal benefits.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.360]   Now, the Bipartisan Budget Act is what they called it,
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.960]   and that was 2015.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:33.160]   That eliminated the ability to use this strategy for anybody
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:39.440]   born after January 2, 1954.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.720]   So basically, for people who are reaching
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.280]   their full retirement age roughly now,
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.760]   it's still available.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.680]   But for younger people, it's been eliminated.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.040]   But if you're somebody who is eligible for that strategy,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.560]   it is extremely beneficial, because you're just
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.760]   collecting the spousal benefit with no downside whatsoever.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.080]   You get four years of spousal benefit
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.160]   while letting your own retirement benefit continue
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.720]   growing.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.480]   But if my spouse is younger than me,
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.040]   it would be at a reduced amount, correct?
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.760]   No, if your spouse is--
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.920]   so OK, a spousal benefit is half of the other person's
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.080]   primary insurance amount.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.960]   And that's true regardless of when the other person files
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.040]   for retirement benefits.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.600]   So let's say, when you reach your full retirement age,
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.280]   so let's assume you have a full retirement age of 66,
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.800]   and let's assume your spouse is three years younger.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.600]   So if your spouse starts her retirement benefit at age 63,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.280]   she'll be getting a reduced retirement benefit, which
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.760]   is to say she'll be getting less than her primary insurance
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.680]   amount.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   And then when you, in this scenario,
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.320]   if you file a restricted application for spousal
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.280]   benefits at that same time, because you reached
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.480]   your full retirement age, you'll be getting half
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.240]   of her primary insurance amount.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.720]   So half of what she would have gotten
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.480]   if she'd waited until full retirement age.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.160]   So you're getting more than half of what
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.760]   she's actually receiving.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.040]   Your spousal benefit is not reduced as a result
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.840]   of her having filed early.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.560]   That's interesting.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.400]   Yeah, I don't think a lot of people know that.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.680]   No, yeah, people get confused about that all the time.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.800]   So that goes away, though, for anybody
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.640]   who was born after 1954.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.760]   That goes away.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.080]   So it's only available for people
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.440]   who right now are reaching full retirement age.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.960]   Yeah, roughly, it's January 2, 1954 is the come off.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:41.360]   What happens if the primary worker in the family passes
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:47.280]   and the widow is not yet full retirement age,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.480]   or the worker who put into the Social Security system
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.800]   wasn't at full retirement age?
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.120]   I mean, what are the benefits for widowers and children
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.480]   of people who have died who have paid into Social Security?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.080]   There's three different types of benefits here, basically,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.640]   that we're going to be talking about.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:11.680]   The first one is the regular widow or widower benefit.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.720]   And eligibility for that begins at age 60.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.880]   OK, is it age 60 for the widower or age 60
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.160]   for the person who was paying in?
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.840]   It's age 60 for the widow or the survivor.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.400]   They have to be age 60.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.480]   There's no requirement for how old the deceased spouse has
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.560]   to have been.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.760]   And the amount that they get, this
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.480]   is one of the more complicated Social Security calculations.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.440]   So this is a simplification.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.240]   But it's if the surviving spouse waits
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.560]   until their full retirement age to file for survivor benefits,
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.720]   the total benefit that they would get
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.360]   is essentially whatever the deceased spouse had
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.040]   been receiving, or if they hadn't yet filed,
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.680]   if the deceased spouse died after their full retirement
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.760]   age, then the surviving spouse would
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   get whatever the deceased spouse would have received if they
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.560]   had filed on their date of death.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.920]   If the deceased spouse died before their full retirement
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.840]   age and had not yet filed, then the surviving spouse
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.360]   gets the deceased person's primary insurance amount,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.480]   so what they would have gotten if they had lived
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.520]   to their full retirement age and filed then.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.120]   Now again, just like any other benefit,
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.960]   survivor benefits are reduced for early filing.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:33.720]   So if the widow or widower files for their widower benefit
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.120]   before their full retirement age,
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.560]   they get less than the full amount.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.600]   Now a super important thing to know
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.440]   for any widows or widowers is that a restricted application
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.960]   strategy that we talked about for spousal benefits,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.520]   it also applies for widow and widower benefits.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.120]   And it was not changed by the Bipartisan Budget Act,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.960]   so it's still available to you regardless
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.920]   of what year you were born.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.640]   And you don't have to wait until your full retirement age.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.800]   So a strategy that frequently makes sense
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:15.360]   for a surviving spouse is to either file for survivor
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.320]   benefits as early as they can, at age 60,
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.720]   while they let their own retirement
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.680]   benefit growing until age 70, or do the opposite.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.840]   So file for their own retirement benefit as early as possible,
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.800]   so at age 62, and let their survivor benefit
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.960]   continue growing until it maxes out at full retirement age.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.080]   So those strategies are--
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.320]   for anybody who loses their spouse before this point,
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.800]   either of those two strategies is almost always
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.560]   the best solution.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.200]   It's almost always the case that they
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.400]   should file for one benefit, the smaller benefit specifically,
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.080]   and let the larger benefit continue
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.160]   growing until it maxes out.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.280]   I'm going to ask a little bit of an esoteric question on this.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.240]   So a lot of people still are not under the Social Security
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.200]   system, meaning they might work for a city,
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.760]   or they might work for the railroad,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.400]   or there are some groups out there,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.880]   or some professions out there where they don't pay
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.240]   into Social Security, they pay into something else,
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.600]   but it's not Social Security.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.840]   So if I am a spouse, and I work for the railroad,
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.760]   so I'm not paying into Social Security,
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.160]   but my spouse is paying into Social Security,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.560]   and my spouse passes away, I'm going
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.960]   to be getting a railroad pension.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.760]   Will I still get half of my spouse's Social Security
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   or survivor benefit from my spouse?
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.920]   Railroad specifically has their own rules.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.120]   And probably more applicable to more people
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.000]   is the government pension.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.840]   OK, let's use government pension then.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.760]   OK, so if we assume then that you worked for, let's say,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.200]   the state of Illinois, and you were paying into their
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.600]   retirement system, but you weren't paying Social Security,
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.480]   and your spouse was paying into Social Security,
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.560]   and then she dies, then you're going
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.960]   to be affected by something called the government pension
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.480]   offset, which means that the amount that you can receive,
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.440]   either as a spouse or a surviving spouse,
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.120]   is going to be reduced by 2/3 of your monthly government pension
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.640]   amount.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.520]   That one does apply to a whole lot of people.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   It does apply to a lot of people.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.960]   So Mike, we've talked about widowers and/or survivors.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.360]   And let's talk about children now.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.680]   What benefits do children get, and for how long
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   do they get them?
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.840]   If you, when you file for retirement benefits,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:41.680]   if you have a minor child, so somebody who is, in this case,
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.240]   either under 18, or in some cases, a full-time student up
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.600]   to 19, or you have an adult disabled child,
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.280]   when you start taking your retirement benefits,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.000]   they can get benefits on your work record.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.440]   And that benefit, that child's benefit,
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.920]   is half of your primary insurance amount.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.800]   If or when you die, if you have minor children
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.840]   or adult disabled children, they can
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.200]   get a child benefit that is 75% of your primary insurance
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.920]   amount.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.360]   In either case, you need to be aware of something
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.040]   called the family maximum rule, which basically
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.720]   is a maximum based on your primary insurance amount.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.920]   And the percentage varies.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.000]   But it could put a limit on the amount
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.960]   that your children and/or surviving spouse
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.040]   could receive as a part of their child benefits and widow
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.880]   benefits.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   I got a lot of questions on the Bogleheads forum
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.640]   about Social Security as it relates
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.840]   to working for another country, or working in another country,
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.440]   US citizen, paying into another country's Social Security type
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.640]   system.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.080]   And how do you get credit for that here in the US?
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.480]   Could you talk about this?
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.920]   Because it came up a lot.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.320]   In fact, three different people asked this particular question.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.440]   The topic that you want to look up
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.480]   is called a totalization agreement.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.840]   These are agreements that the US has with other countries
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.320]   that basically lay out the rules for how a person will
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.600]   be treated under each country's Social Security system
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.040]   when they've paid into both systems, basically.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.560]   And the tricky thing here is that we
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.120]   have separate agreements with each country.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.640]   So the rules and the specifics are
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.920]   going to vary from one to another somewhat.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.440]   And they have to, because, of course,
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.000]   each country has their own system with its own rules.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.560]   So the specifics of the agreements have to vary.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.680]   So the tricky thing here is that you're not really
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.160]   going to find anybody who's an in-depth expert on any one
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.440]   particular country.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.600]   For example, I mean, I write about Social Security
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.160]   all the time.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.560]   I get tons of emails every week.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.760]   And I get maybe two or three people
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.320]   asking about totalization agreements per year.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.840]   And, of course, this year, they might
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.000]   be asking about Germany and the UK.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.840]   And next year, they're asking about Canada and Japan.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.280]   So if I'm only getting one question about Canada
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.720]   every three or four years, of course,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.840]   I'm never going to become an expert on it.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.360]   And same goes for anybody.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.520]   That's even for me dealing with Social Security all the time.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.440]   I don't get asked about any one country's agreement very often.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.800]   I guess the takeaway here is that it's
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.200]   going to be super important for anyone in the situation
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.240]   to do their own research, to actually read the terms
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.400]   of the agreement in question.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.800]   But as a general rule, the way they work
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:44.600]   is they say that if you don't have enough years of earnings
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.040]   under one country or the other country's system
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.080]   to qualify for benefits, the agreement
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.360]   will basically let you count earnings
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.920]   from the other country to qualify for benefits.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.360]   But they don't actually then end up
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.160]   calculating the amount of benefit
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.200]   for which you qualify.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.560]   So roughly speaking, it's going to vary from one country
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.080]   to another.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.560]   But in the US, again, you need 10 years of earnings.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.440]   So let's say you only paid into US Social Security
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.560]   for eight years, but you paid into Germany, for instance.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.000]   If you paid into their system for several years,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.800]   you can qualify for US Social Security
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.320]   under the totalization agreement.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.360]   They'll allow you to count those years that you're
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.800]   paying into that other system.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   One thing that people have to be aware of here
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.680]   is that in some cases, you might also
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.920]   be affected by the Windfall Elimination
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.160]   Provision, which is the rule that basically reduces
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.200]   your primary insurance amount.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.240]   So it reduces your retirement benefit
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.360]   and the benefit of anybody else claiming benefits on your work
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.200]   records, so anybody getting spousal benefits.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.660]   So the Windfall Elimination Provision
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.840]   can, in some cases, apply.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.400]   Well, one of the readers of the Bogleheads Forum
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.000]   just was curious, based on everything
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.520]   you know about Social Security, at what age
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.720]   are you planning on taking Social Security?
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.360]   And what is your rationale for when you are going to take it?
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.880]   And by the way, before we get to that,
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.520]   you're in your early 30s, correct?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.120]   34, so mid-early 30s.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.480]   OK, so would you like to answer that question?
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.840]   Sure.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.080]   And again, my age plays a huge role here,
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.360]   because the true answer to that question
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.760]   is, I have no idea, because I don't
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.200]   know what the system's going to look like when I'm 62.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.780]   It's almost certain that there's going
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.120]   to be significant changes between now and then.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.200]   My honest opinion for somebody in their 30s
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.660]   is that there's no need to spend a lot of time thinking
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.000]   about when you're going to be filing for Social Security,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.840]   because the rules are going to change.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:56.800]   Now, if I were, let's say, in my 50s or 60s right now,
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.080]   coming up on the age in question,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.400]   then I would almost certainly be waiting until 70
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.080]   would be my plan.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.480]   That's because I'm married, and so far, my earnings record
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   is higher than the earnings record of my spouse.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.680]   That could certainly change.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.960]   And if that did change, if she ended up
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.840]   being the one with the higher earnings record,
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.120]   then I would encourage her to wait until 70.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   The strategy that I would be following
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.560]   is the same rough draft strategy, I think,
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.100]   makes sense for most married couples,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.360]   which is higher earner waits until 70,
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.400]   lower earner files somewhat before that.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.600]   And it depends on their life expectancies.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.080]   So if either person is in particularly poor health,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.200]   the lower earner should file pretty early.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.680]   If they're both in very good health,
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.880]   the lower earner should wait, but not necessarily wait
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.160]   all the way until 70.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.960]   Well, Mike, thanks.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.000]   We could go on for probably a week
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.120]   talking about all the different scenarios that
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.880]   could take place.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.960]   But I want to thank you for being our guest on Bogle

[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.800]   Calculator?

[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.720]   I've used it.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.840]   It worked well for me.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.640]   I know what I'm supposed to do now.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.240]   Mike, thanks for being our guest.
