[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Well, last time I said we were taking the week of Thanksgiving off from the podcast
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.200]   to give you more time to listen to the Providence Book audiobook excerpts, and here we are,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.840]   back with Pastor John, who was led to record two special episodes for us.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.840]   We are releasing them Monday and Tuesday this week, today and tomorrow.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.640]   The topic is critical race theory.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.840]   It's a big one among evangelicals in 2020, and it comes up over and over again in the
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.120]   APJA inbox.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.120]   About 50 emails have arrived in just the past year alone, all from listeners who basically
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.080]   just want to hear how Pastor John is thinking about CRT himself.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.120]   And that is what we will do today and tomorrow.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.800]   These are longer than normal episodes, about 22 or 23 minutes each.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   Today Pastor John addresses the relational side of the CRT debate.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.360]   Tomorrow he will address the root problem with CRT.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   I hope you can listen to both episodes.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.280]   Here now is Pastor John with Critical Race Theory, Part 1, The Relationships.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.880]   If critical race theory were only a theoretical or philosophical or intellectual issue, I
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.400]   would definitely start with definitions.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.440]   In fact, I would start with a biblical argument for why definitions and clarity and transparency
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.880]   are essential—essential for Christian faithfulness to Scripture and to God, especially when spiritual
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.800]   forces of darkness and confusion and deception are in the air, which they are.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.840]   Paul calls Satan "the prince of the power of the air."
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.520]   And Satan's specialty in this world is deception through twisted truths and half-truths.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.320]   And deception flourishes in the fog of confusion, and confusion is deepened and advanced through
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.440]   the lack of clarity.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.560]   And clarity is only possible where we know the meaning of terms that we're each using
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.020]   when we talk to each other.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.520]   So I hope you can see how seriously I take definitions and clarity and transparency in
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.160]   communication.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   And I do intend to get to as much definitional clarity as I'm capable of, but not in this
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.160]   episode of Ask Pastor John.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.720]   I'm not going to start with that, and I hope you'll see why before we're done.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.920]   Critical race theory is not only a bundle of beliefs and ideas and ways of thinking
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.640]   about race and other important things, it has also become a relationally destructive
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.880]   means of defamation.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.040]   And that's what I want to talk about first.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.160]   The way Christians treat each other and talk about each other when it comes to this issue
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.900]   of race, or more specifically, critical race theory.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.420]   So I know this first session is going to be frustrating.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.120]   We hope to do two of these.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.280]   And I know this first one is going to be frustrating to listeners because my guess is that thousands
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.080]   of you listening to this right now don't have any clear idea what critical race theory
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.560]   is.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.240]   I want to say, like, join the club.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.320]   I mean, does anybody know what we're talking about?
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.560]   And here I am talking about it as a pejorative label that some people put on other people
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.600]   to their detriment, and I haven't even said what it is.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.060]   How frustrating is that?
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.960]   But please try to trust me, not for a long time.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.080]   I'm not asking you to trust me forever.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.360]   I just—give me a little time in this, and I think you'll see why I'm coming at this
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   so oddly when I love definitional clarity up front.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.460]   I'm going to deal to the best of my ability with a definition in our second episode on
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:28.880]   critical race theory, but there are reasons for tackling the relational issue among Christians
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.220]   first, and I hope you'll see that as we go.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.640]   There are biblical relational principles at stake here that I think do not depend on the
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.200]   definition of critical race theory because they apply to all kinds of explosive issues.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.800]   That's what I want to get at.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.760]   Those biblical relational principles, and I think this needs to be said first.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.060]   I want to illustrate what I'm talking about with a podcast conversation, a podcast conversation
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.660]   about critical race theory between Rasool Berry, teaching pastor at the Bridge Church
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:19.600]   in Brooklyn, and Neil Shenvey, whose apologetics website describes him as a homeschooling theoretical
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.160]   chemist.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.760]   And believe me, that is an understatement when it comes to his qualifications.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.400]   They both have written and spoken about critical race theory.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.320]   Both are articulate.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.060]   Both are winsome.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.680]   I found myself really liking and appreciating these two Christian brothers, even when they
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.200]   were emphasizing very different perspectives on critical race theory.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.360]   When I put it like that, namely emphasizing very different perspectives, I don't say even
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.520]   when they were disagreeing because I couldn't put my finger on any specific disagreement
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:10.200]   about the rightness or the wrongness of critical race theory in its specific assertions.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.880]   What mainly emerged in this conversation, and what was so helpful to me, was a clarification
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.800]   of the relational dynamics at work in these kinds of conversations.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   They were hosted by Justin Brierley on the unbelievable show, and you can watch it on
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.360]   YouTube.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.520]   I think Pastor Berry was speaking for lots of African Americans, not all of them.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.400]   Nobody speaks for all African Americans.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:49.280]   When he said that his primary concern—those are his words, his primary concern, his primary
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.840]   critique of the whole conversation.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.600]   He's thinking culture-wide, not just his conversation with Shenve.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.040]   He said his primary concern was that he and many others woke up one morning, so to speak,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.720]   and found that they had been tarred and feathered with the label "critical race theory."
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.160]   He had to go look it up, just like most of us did.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.960]   He said he was born and raised in inner-city Philadelphia, went to University of Pennsylvania,
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.040]   majored in Africana Studies and Sociology, became a Christian his freshman year, was
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.720]   formed by evangelicalism.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.840]   And during his studies, during all that undergraduate work in Africana Studies, he never heard about
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.960]   CRT at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.800]   To quote him, quote, "The brothers and I had not even heard of critical race theory
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.440]   until we were told that when we said something needs to change, when George Floyd was kneeled
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.280]   on, we were being held captive by critical race theory.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.540]   What are you talking about?
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.320]   We said, I'm just trying to respond to the injustices all around me."
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.680]   And then he explains, "I'm being given a label," he says, "that I don't really
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   want to be talking about.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.880]   I want to be talking about the death that is in the street and the disparities like
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.080]   COVID having a disproportionate impact on people of color.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.940]   We see these disparities across education, health care, economics.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:34.640]   I would rather talk about that, but any time you talk about that in Christian circles,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.320]   you are given this title," he says.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:46.520]   And then he adds, "More energy is being devoted to the tethering of critical race
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:54.240]   theory to what we are saying than is being devoted to the problem of racism itself."
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:02.360]   Or, more broadly, he expresses his concern this way, "The church is being brought
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.840]   ethical concerns and is responding with epistemological critique.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:15.080]   Like a man who tells you he's bleeding, and you ask, 'How did you come to that
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.720]   conclusion?'"
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.040]   Now, I said that my aim here is to get at biblical relational issues that are relevant
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.960]   quite apart from the definition of critical race theory.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:35.880]   So in view of what we've just heard from Rasool Berry, let me state two of those biblical
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.920]   relational principles, and then unpack them one at a time.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:50.240]   Number one, Christians should be careful not to slander a Christian brother by the
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.440]   careless use of pejorative labels like critical race theory.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.640]   That's principle number one.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   Principle number two, when a Christian brother is honestly analyzing and exposing false beliefs
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:14.460]   or unbiblical ways of thinking like critical race theory, we should not silence or denounce
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.240]   the brother by pointing to blood in the streets.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.720]   Now let me say a word about each of those principles, because my guess is that the first
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:35.060]   one may offend some critics of critical race theory, and the second one may offend some
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:42.600]   justice warriors, both of whom may be doing exactly what they should be doing, and neither
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.080]   of whom do I want to offend.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.240]   So first a word about slander.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.800]   Jesus said, "What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   a person.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.560]   For out of the heart come evil thoughts, false witness, slander.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.920]   These are what defile a person."
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.640]   Paul said that our new identity in Christ involves putting away all bitterness and wrath
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.120]   and anger and clamor and slander, but that we be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.000]   forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you, Ephesians 4:31.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.360]   And Peter said that when we're born again, we should put away all malice and all slander,
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.220]   1 Peter 2.1.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.280]   And that quote from Jesus was Matthew 15.90.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.520]   Slander, what is it?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:47.640]   Slander is speaking untrue, pejorative things about someone, usually in public.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.440]   And Jesus and Paul and Peter say, "That's just not what Christians do.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.920]   We don't do that to each other."
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:07.000]   Now, my guess is that when Pastor Barry says that he and others were pinned with critical
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.320]   race theory label before they even knew what it was, some critics of critical race theory
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.640]   will point out that you can be infected with a disease without knowing the name of the
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.720]   disease, which of course is true.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.400]   We all know that's true.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:34.140]   But I am underscoring that it is a very serious thing to tell the world, which is what social
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:43.880]   media does, that somebody has a deadly intellectual and moral disease, which you may even think
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:51.420]   is worthy of excommunication, when all you see is a few symptoms of the disease, which
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:57.880]   may not be owing to the disease at all, but owing to some other cause.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.320]   What if one of the symptoms of the disease is excessive perspiration, but this perspiration
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.440]   is owing to long hours of hard work on some worthy cause?
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.800]   What if one of the symptoms of the disease is a loss of appetite, but this loss of appetite
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.240]   is owing to deep sorrow rather than to the disease?
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:28.900]   Americans should be so hesitant to slander a brother with pejorative labels that we go
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:36.480]   the extra mile to make sure we know, we know whether his actions or statements are really
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:43.440]   owing to his infection with the lethal aspects of critical race theory or not.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:52.280]   In fact, I think one of the best ways to avoid slander in these highly contentious days is
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   this.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:01.640]   If you hear or read a brother say something that you think is unchristian or unbiblical
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.840]   with regard to race, don't call it critical race theory.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.520]   Call it unchristian.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.120]   Call it unbiblical.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:17.800]   Preferably in a private email, not a public tweet or blog or podcast, and give solid biblical
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.080]   evidence for your concern.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:27.860]   Here's one more point on this first biblical relational principle of avoiding slander.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:35.880]   One way to avoid slander is not assuming that we know a person's ethical or intellectual
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:45.420]   or doctrinal stance on the basis of the questions they ask rather than the answers they give.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:52.620]   If I pose the question, "Why there may be racial disparities in health care or education
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:15:02.020]   or anything else," and you assume that because of my question I am infected with the disease
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.580]   of critical race theory, you're on the brink of slander.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:16.380]   It is possible for two people to ask the same question and come to radically different answers.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:24.100]   So labeling someone on the basis of their questions is careless at best and possibly
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   slander.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:33.500]   So my first biblical relational principle that I'm pleading for is Christians should
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:43.320]   be careful not to slander a fellow Christian by the careless use of pejorative labels like
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.060]   critical race theory.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.380]   Now here's number two, second, and there are only two.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:56.160]   When a Christian brother is honestly analyzing and exposing false beliefs or unbiblical ways
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:03.940]   of thinking, say in critical race theory, we should not silence or denounce the brother
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.420]   by pointing to blood in the streets.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.620]   Now the biblical principle behind this is Romans 12.4.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:23.260]   In one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.300]   That's the biblical principle.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:32.580]   Now I am not saying that Rasool Berry did this, that he pulled rank in that way and
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.780]   tried to silence his conversation partner, Neil Shenvey.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.300]   I'm not saying he did that.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.340]   He didn't do that.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:49.260]   But I want to address this because that is the way he will be criticized.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:55.820]   Berry will be criticized when he says, for example, "The church is being brought ethical
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.800]   concerns and is responding with epistemological critique."
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.820]   Like a man who tells you he's bleeding, and you ask, "Well, how did you come to that
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.060]   conclusion?"
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.300]   People are going to criticize that kind of statement, first because it's an overstatement,
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   which it is.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:21.580]   Everybody uses overstatement, as if the whole church is doing nothing but epistemology in
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:29.340]   response to the ethical issue of our time, and second because people will hear that statement
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:38.260]   as shutting down all intellectual wrestling with false ideas, which are upstream from
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.660]   the deadly effects they may have in the streets.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:49.420]   Instead of silencing or denouncing someone who is wrestling with the intellectual or
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:57.820]   theoretical or epistemological roots of false beliefs and unbiblical thinking, let's give
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:06.100]   each other some room to be different in the way we attack the same evil.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.300]   For example, COVID-19 is a killer.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.340]   One person is fighting it in the research laboratory 18 hours a day.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.140]   Another person is fighting it as a doctor or a nurse on the ground with his hands in
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.340]   the blood in the intensive care unit.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:29.060]   Another person is a politician doing his best to discern what policies might hinder the
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.900]   spread of this disease.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.620]   Another person is giving people guidance and hope with biblical interpretations of God's
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.460]   providence and trying to comfort those who've lost loved ones.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:47.140]   And how mistaken it would be for the doctor with his hands in the blood, risking his life
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.780]   in the intensive care unit to say to the researcher who has never touched a diseased person, "Stop
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.660]   wasting your time in the laboratory and get out here where the suffering is and get your
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.980]   hands dirty for goodness sakes."
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.220]   The same is true for racism.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:12.600]   Most Christians realize that belittling or disrespecting or hating or rejecting or hindering
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.500]   the success of someone simply because of their race is evil.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.460]   One Christian might fight that evil in the street, another in the courts, another as
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:32.140]   a mother raising loving and respectful children, another as an academic historian unfolding
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:39.100]   the way race was constructed as an instrument of oppression, another preaching his heart
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:45.660]   out, the whole counsel of God trying to overcome the racism in his congregation, and another
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:52.940]   critiquing critical race theory precisely because he believes it is not a biblical path
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.240]   to justice and love but a destructive path.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:08.940]   So my second biblical relational principle then is that we not silence or denounce one
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:17.580]   strategy of love by exalting another, that we not say, "There's blood in the streets,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:24.780]   therefore intellectual critiques of critical race theory are not a priority right now,"
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:30.220]   nor that we say, "Demolishing critical race theory is such a priority that putting a tourniquet
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.340]   on a bleeding man in the street is irrelevant to the great struggles of our time."
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:41.520]   Brothers, we don't need to do this to each other.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:50.100]   There are tens of thousands of pastors right now who are not trying to tether critical
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.480]   race theory to every black lover of justice.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:02.340]   And there are critics of critical race theory who believe with all their heart and rightly
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:08.960]   that there are aspects of critical race theory that are destructive to love and justice and
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.000]   racial harmony so that their investment in criticizing critical race theory is not a
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.080]   detour away from the problem of racism but an effort to destroy it.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:30.360]   So next time, in the next episode, I will try to say, "What in the world is it?
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:37.200]   Finally, what is critical race theory and why is it so controversial?"
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:47.160]   But for now, I am making two pleas from my heart to my brothers and sisters in the faith,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   and I'll just mention them as we close in reverse order this time.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.400]   When a Christian brother is honestly analyzing and exposing false beliefs and unbiblical
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:07.200]   ways of thinking, we should not silence or denounce or minimize the brother by pointing
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.800]   to blood in the streets.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:18.440]   And Christians should be careful, oh, so careful, not to slander a Christian brother by the
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:24.720]   careless use of pejorative labels like "critical race theory."
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.920]   That was Critical Race Theory Part 1, The Relationships.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.320]   Part 2 is coming up tomorrow, titled Critical Race Theory Part 2, The Root Problem.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.400]   On the Ask Pastor John podcast, thank you for listening.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.840]   We'll see you back here tomorrow.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   [END]
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   1
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   The Root Problem
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840]   The Root Problem is a controversial topic.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   It is a topic that has been discussed in the past, and it is a topic that is being discussed
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   in the present.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   It is a topic that is being discussed in the present.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   It is a topic that is being discussed in the present.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   It is a topic that is being discussed in the present.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.840]   It is a topic that is being discussed in the present.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.840]   It is a topic that is being discussed in the present.
