[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.340]   - We're back with Ray Ortlund,
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.460]   our guest on the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.220]   as John Piper is on a writing leave right now,
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.420]   working on his next book project.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.780]   And Ray, as you know, our greatest problem is sin.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.340]   We deserve God's judgment,
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.020]   and Christ has come to pay that penalty
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.860]   and to set us free eternally.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.740]   But there's so many other benefits to this salvation
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.780]   that we now enjoy in Christ.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.300]   How does the gospel apply to the ever-returning anxieties
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.700]   and insecurities and the frettings that we experience
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.580]   in the Christian life?
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.580]   In those times, where do we go to regain our joy in Christ?
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.140]   - Well, I would say, first of all, Tony,
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.300]   there is a kind of hidden blessing
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.060]   in looking back on my past
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.620]   and feeling wounded by my sin and folly.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.620]   That humbles me.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.140]   It keeps me leaning into the Lord
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.840]   and solemnizes me and warns me
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.820]   about my own potential for sin.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.380]   So I'm grateful for that.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.600]   But on the other hand, there are, as you suggest,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.580]   anxieties and frettings and so forth
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.700]   that are not of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.780]   And the Lord does not want us to bear those burdens.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.260]   One of my favorite passages in the Bible is 1 Peter 5, 7,
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.380]   "Cast all your cares on him, for he cares for you."
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.140]   And the original text suggests the idea
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.420]   that if it matters to you, it matters also to him.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.740]   He does not despise us
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.020]   for the many things we find hard to bear.
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.460]   He doesn't tell us, "Buck up."
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.460]   He invites us to cast it on his broad shoulders
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.860]   so that he bears it for us.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.660]   Now, Tony, when I think about
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.700]   how does that actually happen for me?
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700]   I mean, it doesn't happen enough.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.040]   I'm not very good at trusting the Lord.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   But what gives me traction to get free at heart,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.940]   to trust in the Lord and rejoice
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.620]   and get my eyes off myself and my problems and so forth?
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.200]   The best strategy for me to regain peace and confidence
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.420]   is to go to church.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.880]   I worship with my church.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120]   I see the people in my church.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.100]   They're oxygen to me.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.740]   And just by being there,
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.080]   they help me to feel afresh that Jesus is enough.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.680]   And then, of course, they have problems too.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.940]   And I become more aware of that.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.740]   And that matters to me.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.760]   So I start to think about them and care about them.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.000]   And they matter, every single one of them, wonderful people.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.080]   So at a number of levels,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.880]   I have found, Tony,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.440]   that my most effective strategy or remedy
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.080]   for battling through to confidence and joy,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.700]   certainly not vegging out in front of TV,
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.960]   but going to my wonderful church
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.600]   and just enjoying the Lord with my friends.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   So seriously, from 10.30 to noon,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.320]   every Sunday morning is my happiest
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.000]   and most sane moment in the whole week.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And I find in the wonderful presence of the Lord there
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.460]   in that gospel culture,
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.380]   I am lifted in my heart to believe the promises of God again
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.140]   and get happy again.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.060]   And I get fresh legs for the next challenge in life,
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.460]   even as I also have the privilege
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.960]   of imparting strength to others.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.740]   - Wonderful, what a beautiful way to end this week.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.920]   Thank you, Ray.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.360]   And as we break for the weekend,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.460]   you can look back on the episodes from the week
