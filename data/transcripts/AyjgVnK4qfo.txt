[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.360]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. If you have a question, email us at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.320]   Today's Portfolio Rescue is brought to you by Innovator ETFs. Duncan, one area where
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.320]   investors haven't really had to think about protecting themselves to the downside is bonds.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.380]   Now that interest rates have risen quite a bit, people are finally saying, "Oh wait, bonds
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.680]   can actually fall in price a little bit." This is especially true for long-duration bonds.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.480]   One of the reasons that certain investors like to hold long-duration bonds is because
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.440]   they tend to give you more bang for your buck during a recession. If interest rates fall
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.360]   and we go into deflation, all else equal, higher-duration bonds will have greater sensitivity
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.960]   to changed rates. When rates rise, prices fall more than shorter-term bonds, but when
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.640]   rates fall, those prices tend to rise more. So, let's look at the TLT as the 20-year Treasury
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.220]   ETF. In 2019, it was up 14%. In 2020, it was up 18%. In 2022, it's down 22%. So, Innovator
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.200]   has this TLT ETF that has a buffer to the downside. So, it protects you with 9% buffer,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.080]   meaning the first down 9%, if you start from zero, you're protected. But it also has a
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.800]   cap of 27%. So, your defined outcomes are, you can earn as much as 27%, and your first
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   9% is capped for losses. Now, the thinking here would be, okay, we could see inflation
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.000]   remain stubbornly high, and that could see rates rise even further on the high end, right?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.640]   And that would crush them some more. So, we want to protect on the downside. Alternatively,
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.700]   the Fed could get its way, raise rates enough where the economy slows, and we actually do
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.080]   get some disinflation, or maybe even deflation, and rates fall again. And then, you don't
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.640]   want to miss out on those gains. So, the way you use these defined outcomes ETFs is that
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.760]   you have a cap on the upside, but you have some buffer to the downside. Pretty interesting.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.520]   So, no matter what happens, you're kind of okay. And that's why they have these defined
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   outcomes, so you have the ranges to know. To learn more about this and other ETFs from
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   defined outcomes, go to InnovatorETFs.com.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080]   It's like you can see the future.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.960]   Well, you can at least give yourself some markers, so you know, over here I'm okay,
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.480]   and over here I'm okay, and I know what I'm going to get, depending on what the market
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.120]   does. All right. So, I was looking at the drawdowns today. John, throw up this chart.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.280]   This is the Dow and the S&P. Look at this morning. Dow is down from the highs 17%. The
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.240]   S&P is down 21%. Duncan, wouldn't you say vibes alone, it feels like twice as bad as
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.100]   this? I know this is not great. We're in a bear market. The Nasdaq is down more. A bunch
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.120]   of people are going to be in the comments saying, "Well, look at the individual stocks
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120]   I own. They're down 50%, 60%, 70%."
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.640]   Well, yeah. That's what I was about to say. I'd love to have those returns right now.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.020]   The stock market itself, though, it's not necessarily in a crash, even though sentiment
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.500]   feels like we're in a crash. So, I don't know if that's good news or bad news. Because,
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.520]   good news, maybe things haven't gotten as bad as people think. Obviously, you could
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.080]   adjust these for inflation and say they're a little worse. Bad news is, we have more
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.040]   room to fall. So, I guess it depends if you're a glass is half-full, glass is half-empty
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   kind of guy.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.240]   When have you ever seen sentiment this bad before?
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:21.400]   I mean, 2008, for sure. At the end, people just kind of gave up. The stock market peaked
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.800]   in October 2007. We didn't bottom until March 2009. If you think about it, all that stuff
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.960]   that happened with Lehman Brothers and AIG and all the bank blowups, that was in September
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.160]   and October of 2008. And the market didn't bottom until March 2009. So, that lasted so
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.680]   long that people, at the end, had kind of just thrown up their hands and given up. So,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.000]   that, for sure, was just as bad. But, back then, you didn't have social media throwing
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   it in your face every day. That's part of the problem. If you're on that as much as
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.640]   people like we are, you probably assume the sentiment is worse than real life. When you
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.380]   go out into the real world, and a restaurant's full of people spending money, and the subway's
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.440]   full and all this stuff, it doesn't feel as bad there as it does when you're paying attention
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.280]   to this stuff as much as we do. So, for us, maybe that sentiment is amplified, actually.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.760]   Alright. Let's do a question.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.920]   Okay. So, up first, we have, "I'm a 31-year-old financial planner married with two young kids.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.600]   My wife and I just sold our house to move school districts and we'll rent for the next
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.840]   year. We will clear $70,000 from our house. Our goal is to buy our forever home within
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.560]   the next year. With where Bitcoin is sitting," I can't wait to see the comments on this
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.720]   one. "With where Bitcoin is sitting, I'm very tempted to put $10,000 to $50,000 of
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.120]   our $70,000 cash into Bitcoin and wait a year to see what happens. My wife would definitely
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.080]   not like this, and I know as a financial planner that the responsible answer is, 'Hell no,'
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.560]   or maybe just 5% of our cash. But I can't help but think that if Bitcoin returns to
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.880]   its high of $67,000, I could double or triple our cash for purchasing a forever home. I
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.000]   have a guaranteed salary of $90,000 and my wife makes $40,000 a year. We have no debt
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.420]   and I save 10% of my income for retirement."
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.920]   So I don't like the idea of timing the housing market, but it sounds like these people timed
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.400]   the housing market pretty well. They sold their house, they're gonna wait a year. I
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.880]   think waiting a year in the housing market right now could be okay if rates stay high
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.360]   for a while, that it could slow down. Obviously, initial blush, if we're being honest here,
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.440]   Ben's initial reaction is, "This is a ridiculous idea. Do not do it." But let's just look at
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.280]   the cost-benefit just to see. Okay, you said you have $70,000 in cash. Let's assume that's
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.040]   your entire down payment. You're going to do a 20% down payment. That would be 20% of,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.240]   for a $70,000 down payment, is a $350,000 house. $280,000 mortgage. I don't know if
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.040]   you're going to put more cash down and maybe have a smaller percentage, but let's just
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.320]   go with this for illustrative purposes here. $350,000 house with a $70,000 down payment
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.600]   is a mortgage of $280,000, using a 5% fixed rate mortgage. Who knows where mortgage rates
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.760]   will be in a year? We're talking, in a 30 fixed rate mortgage, a monthly payment of
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.480]   like $1,500 a month. Right? Still with me, Duncan? Now, let's say you went up to your
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.960]   max limit and you put $50K into Bitcoin. You kept $20,000 out and you put $50K in there.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.440]   And it snaps back. Maybe it doesn't even reach those all-time highs, because that's asking
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.600]   a lot, probably. Let's say it just doubled. We go from $20K to $40K. Now, you take your
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.720]   $50K, you've doubled it, you have your extra $20K, you have your $120,000 put down. That
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.640]   would drop your monthly payment to like $1,230 a month if you used all of that for your down
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.960]   payment. Right? So, you're saving like $270 a month. Right? That's real money for people.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.080]   But what if you're wrong? What if Bitcoin goes back to $5,000 like it did in March 2020?
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.720]   What if it keeps crashing? We have Coinbase blows up or some other thing and Sam Bankman
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.920]   Freed can't save everyone. It's not out of the realm of possibilities. Right? Now, that
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.680]   $50K gets crushed and now you have $12,500. Right? And you can only make a down payment
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.360]   of less than 10%. Right? Because you lost a good chunk of it. In that case, we're talking
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.240]   about a monthly payment of $1,700 a month or $200 more. So, obviously, these are the
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.560]   extreme examples. You do really well, you do really poorly. There could be a middle
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.880]   ground there. But I wanted to look at the extremes, because I think especially the downside,
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.720]   that's what you want to think about in these cases. Here's the thing. Do you want to bet
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.000]   your forever home on crypto? Can you imagine how angry your wife would be if you lost a
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.320]   bunch of this money and you tried to pull this off and it doesn't work? I mean, newsflash,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.120]   you can't live on the blockchain. Right? And if, let's say, rates continue to go higher
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.920]   in the mortgage market and your monthly payment is even higher now, and that down payment
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:41.520]   would help you a lot. Listen, what would I do? Take $20,000 of this, put it into Series
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.720]   I savings bonds. You're earning 9% annualized right now. Put the rest of it in short-term
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.360]   bonds or online savings account. You can earn 1-3% in there. It's not life-changing money,
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.760]   but it's much better than it was in the recent past. If you want to get cute with this, maybe
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   take $5,000 to $10,000 and speculate. Let's say you take $10,000 of the $70,000. You still
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.720]   have $60,000 for a down payment. That's not going to change your life all that much. Let's
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.680]   say Bitcoin does go back to all-time highs and you turn $10,000 into $30,000. That can
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   mean something.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.160]   And you still get to look like a genius to your friends.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.660]   Yeah. And you don't look like as much of an idiot if it doesn't work. Here's how you think
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:27.120]   about a down payment. At 5% interest over 30 years, every $5,000 equates to $30 a month
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.400]   for your mortgage. Thinking about the upside and the downside there, it's not going to
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.040]   help you a ton if it works out to be right. I know it seems like a lot of money, but I
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.760]   understand the human desire to speculate. I just think speculation should always be
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.920]   sized appropriately, especially when dealing with a goal that's important. I would rather
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.200]   have no speculation at all when dealing with something like a house down payment. If it's
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.800]   something else, if you've got $5,000 saved and you want to buy a boat, have at it. Put
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.320]   it in Bitcoin if you want. I just don't know if I'd ever be comfortable taking a chance
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.200]   with something that important, especially when your wife is already against it. I don't
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.240]   see the upside and downside. We're not talking about an asymmetric upside bet here. The symmetry
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.120]   is to the downside. Yeah. And it's a slippery slope, right? They
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.440]   could start getting into altcoins and be like, "Oh, well, maybe I could have X return more
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:27.720]   than Bitcoin, even. Or maybe I could have a basket of altcoins." So it's just where
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.480]   this could end up in a bad place, I guess. If you're right, you think, "Okay, well, I'm
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.160]   just going to pull all the equity out of my home and put it into something else, and that's
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.040]   going to work next time." Unfortunately, every once in a while, one of these speculations
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.000]   is not going to work, and you don't want it to be on a house when maybe the bank says,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.140]   "You need this down payment to qualify for this mortgage," and now you don't. I wouldn't
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.480]   play around here. Fun question, though.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.960]   Let's do another one. This next one's kind of a long one, but I wanted to include a lot
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.000]   of it because it's interesting to hear the thought process some people go through on
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.600]   this stuff. So let's do it.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.720]   Yeah. So this is a two-pager, for those of you watching. Is there ever a time where you
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.360]   would say, "Damn the company match," and stop investing in your 401(k)? Here is my situation.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.520]   I live in high-cost Chicago suburbs. Wife and I are both 44. We have two grade school-aged
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.560]   boys, good salaries, and low-rate mortgage debt. We have $400,000 in Roths and $1.2 million
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.900]   in 401(k), but only $33,000 in taxable accounts. We backdoor Roth every year. My wife is a
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.400]   partner in her firm and required to max out her 401(k) in pension. That kind of confused
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.320]   me. I've never heard of that "required to max out," but we can talk about that later.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   I guess the pension is a big part of it, but yeah.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.200]   She is a couple of years from investing in a pension that will pay her six figures annually
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.280]   in retirement. My company match is 1.5% of my salary, and I only contribute enough to
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:57.160]   give a 6% match. Neither of us wants to work until we are 65. Fifty-five would be ideal.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.840]   We currently do not contribute to our taxable accounts due to a massive home renovation
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.800]   we are about to undertake, but will allow us to comfortably stay in place for the next
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.640]   15 years or so until we move away from Chicago to the mountains somewhere. Once the remodel
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.140]   is paid for, we will be directing excess funds towards taxable accounts. We have anywhere
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.320]   from 11 to 15 years to bulk up our taxable accounts to put us in a position to bridge
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.480]   the early retirement gap to retirement fund pension age. The conclusion I keep coming
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   to is it's not worth giving up $2,000 in free money just to put money into our taxable accounts.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.200]   Also, based on our time frame of 11 to 15 years, I know rate of contribution is more
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.840]   important than returns, so I feel like I'm just spinning myself into the ground, weighing
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.480]   the pros and cons.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.240]   Ben's rule number one of retirement savings is you always get the match. If you don't
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.400]   get it, you're turning down free money. I understand the thought process here. You already
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.760]   have a big allocation to tax-deferred retirement accounts. You do have the pension coming,
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.240]   which is nice, and a lot of people don't. I guess this certainly falls in our not to
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:07.320]   brag category. Andy and his wife are doing pretty well here, so kudos to you for that.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.920]   Listen, I understand the idea it makes sense to build up your taxable account since you're
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.000]   going to retire early and don't want to pay penalties on early withdrawals. The idea of
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.600]   diversifying your tax base makes sense, too, so you can have a little give and take when
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:26.120]   you do take those withdrawals from your retirement accounts. I guess your 1.5% that you're receiving
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.560]   on your match is not life-changing money, but it's free money nonetheless, and I can
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.280]   see why people wouldn't want to turn it down.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.240]   Let's work through some options before we go canceling that $401K match. I've done some
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.560]   remodeling in the past. It always takes a lot longer than you think and costs, I don't
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.080]   know, 20-40% more than you assume it will. But you said these payments will be done in
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.880]   a couple of years, and you plan on throwing them in your taxable account. You can do some
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.960]   simple back-of-the-envelope calculations. I think someone's been reading Ben's Everything
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.120]   You Need to Know About Saving for Retirement book, because they said they know that their
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.880]   contributions matter more than their returns over 11-15 years, right? So, they've been
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.360]   paying attention. I think you can do some pretty simple back-of-the-envelope calculations
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.200]   to see where those savings will get you in 11-15 years. You could also see how much you
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.600]   can set aside in that taxable account for a few years before canceling. Give it a couple
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.640]   years and see how much progress you're making. And if it's not where you think you'd like
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.520]   to be at for a few years, you can always rethink that $401K match.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.200]   But how about that money in the Roth? One of the great features of having a Roth is
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.960]   that you can pull out your contributions penalty and tax-free. You can't take the investment
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.800]   earnings out penalty and tax-free, but you can take the contributions. So, if you're
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.720]   doing that back-to-Roth every year, you can take out the contributions tax-free. So, if
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   you want to bridge that gap between $55K and $65K, and you don't have enough in your taxable
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.480]   account, maybe the Roth contributions can make up some of it.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.180]   The good news is, it sounds like you and your wife are great planners, and this is a relatively
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.840]   small decision in the grand scheme of things. Getting to this level, and you're niching
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.160]   it down to this much, you're doing pretty good. And who knows what will happen. Maybe
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.600]   you'll reach $55K and realize one or both of you don't want to retire. You want to work
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.280]   a little longer, and then it won't matter as much, and you can prolong that. Maybe you'll
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.720]   have saved more than expected. Maybe you'll save less than expected. You just have to
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.760]   work. The good news with these kinds of decisions, it's not set in stone. You can always change
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.960]   your mind later. But, I think you give it a couple years, see how long this renovation
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.180]   takes, and once you get there, you can kind of have an idea of the money. But, yeah, does
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.320]   it always, always make sense 100% of the time to take the match? Maybe it's 99% of the time.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.040]   I could allow for 1% where it doesn't make sense. But, I'd say give it some time and
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.060]   see how much money you can start building up the taxable account first, before you shut
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.680]   that off. Because it is, again, it's turned down free money.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.000]   - Yeah, yeah, free money. There aren't many opportunities for that. So, sounds good.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.720]   - Yeah. But, yeah, you're in a pretty good place. All right, let's do another one.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.640]   - Okay, so up next. "I'm in retirement and using the 4% rule to fund my lifestyle. My
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.320]   question is, is it better to sell 4% of my portfolio at the beginning of the year, or
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.520]   sell throughout the year, as I need the money? Which strategy leads to more wealth in the
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.760]   long run? Assume you are invested 100% in U.S. equity index funds."
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.520]   - All right, we've gotten a lot of questions like this lately from people who want to know,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.200]   "How do I spend money in retirement? I'm nervous. We're in a bear market. What does this mean?"
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.440]   This is basically an opposite. This is a reverse dollar-cost averaging situation. So, my person
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.040]   I lean on, my expert for dollar-cost averaging, the great Nick Maggiuli, he writes at Of Dollars
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.960]   and Data. He works with us at Red Hat Wealth Management.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.040]   - Just keep buying.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.640]   - New book, Just Keep Buying. So, Nick, this is the opposite. And when this question came
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.240]   in, I immediately sent it to you. I said, "Have you ever done anything like this?" And
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:32.440]   I think your tagline to me was, "Buy quickly, but sell slowly." Right? Is that the idea?
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.760]   - Yes, exactly. So, I actually wrote about this in the book. And I think the main thing
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.840]   to think about when you're thinking about buying and selling, I mean, there's one core
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.880]   idea here, which is the market tends to go up over time. And so, given that, just imagine
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.240]   a series that just keeps slowly increasing over time. You'd want to buy sooner, so you
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.200]   get in on that appreciation. And then, given that it's going up over time, you'd also want
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.980]   to sell more slowly, right? You want to buy more quickly and sell more slowly because
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.800]   of this appreciation, right? And I've actually run the numbers on this. I did a whole blog
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.600]   post on this just on sell slowly. I kind of dug into it a little bit more, kind of related
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.840]   to blackjack and stuff, looked at the edge that you have by following a strategy where
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.520]   you sell, let's say, each quarter over the course of a year versus selling right at the
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.580]   beginning of the year. And honestly, the percentage is small. It's not like you're making a huge...
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.280]   If you do this over one year, you're going to probably outperform by like 20 bps on average.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.880]   So it's like 20 basis points, 0.2%. It's not a lot. But if you do this over a long period
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.200]   of time, let's say your entire retirement, the quarterly withdrawals is going to outperform
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   by a bit more, right? And you annualize that 20 bps, it adds up to a bit more money. So
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.240]   that's kind of the main takeaway there. I think that's the thing that I would think
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.600]   about when doing that, right?
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.200]   When you say you ran the data, I'd believe anything you say next.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.660]   Just ran the numbers on this.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.620]   It makes sense, though. And you showed, John, throughout the chart here that shows how often
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.420]   quarterly withdrawals beat beginning of year withdrawals. You can see it goes up over time
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.980]   much like the stock market. So it makes sense that if you slowly but surely withdraw instead
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.100]   of taking a big chunk out at the beginning of the year. Now, some people would say psychologically,
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.780]   "I want that number at the beginning of the year no matter what happens in the market
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.540]   because then I know that is locked in." But the way I look at this is, you're kind of
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:18.200]   diversifying your withdrawals, right? Because a lot of people ask us the lump sum and dollar
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.180]   cost averaging question going in. There aren't as many easy strategies to follow when getting
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.740]   out. And obviously, the other part of this is, and I'm sure you've written about this
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.120]   too, Nick, is the sequence of return risk, right? If you start taking your money out
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.540]   and there's a huge bear market that hits, that can really alter your portfolio going
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.100]   forward. And I think actually having some diversification beyond asset classes and strategies
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.140]   and diversification in your withdrawal strategy actually can probably help a little bit too.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.980]   Because even when markets are falling, they're very volatile, right? And you could see these
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.640]   snapback rallies, even if you happen to retire in a bear market, where taking it out over
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.280]   time is probably going to help you. Because obviously, if you take it out right before
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.700]   a bear market, you'll feel better. But eventually, you're going to have to hit and take some
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.720]   out then. And you looked at this for a 100% stock portfolio. In a balanced portfolio,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.980]   the good thing is, you may be allowed to rebalance your portfolio as you make withdrawals as
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.860]   well, by taking from places that aren't getting hammered as much as the stock market.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.900]   Yeah, exactly. Right. And so I think the effects are even, the less volatile your portfolio,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.540]   the smaller these impacts are. So like, we're already talking about a small difference now,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.900]   so I wouldn't sweat the small stuff on this. It's really not that big of a difference whether
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.900]   you do beginning of year or quarterly. But technically, quarterly will outperform, especially
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.460]   over like a, you know, multi-decade retirement time frame.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.700]   Yeah. And there's other people who will say, "I'm going to keep two to three years as a
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.440]   cash cushion in case the stock market falls, and I'm going to use that kind of break in
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.580]   case of emergency kind of thing. Maybe this is the kind of emergency I want to use that
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:47.280]   for." But yeah, your whole thought process there makes sense. Buy quickly, put the money
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.140]   to work, because stocks usually go up. It doesn't feel like it this year, but most of
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:57.820]   the time, stocks go up. And I do think your book here, Just Keep Buying, I'm actually
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.100]   glad it came out during a bear market, because that's when you need to hear this message
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.800]   more than during a -- it's easy to keep buying during a bull market, right? When it's a bear
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.180]   market and you want to stick to that plan, that makes more sense, right?
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.580]   Yes, of course. Okay, let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:19.400]   Okay. Up next we have, "When making a retirement portfolio, what would you use for real return
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:25.580]   of bond and equity allocations? Would using zero for bond and 2% for equity be conservative,
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.820]   realistic enough?" No, real return, not nominal. For new whales and young people and stuff,
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.880]   can you explain this a little bit? Because I'm having trouble.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:40.540]   This is asking for return expectations, net of inflation, right? On a real basis, standard
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.260]   of living, what can you expect your retirement portfolio to do over the long term? So, John,
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.620]   fill up the first table here. I took this from Assaf Damodaran at NYU, and stocks, bonds,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.740]   and cash going back to 1928. I looked at nominal returns. Those are the actual compounded returns.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.940]   Then, over that same time frame, inflation was roughly 3% per year. So, you can see that
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.940]   the real returns go down by that inflation rate. You can see stocks have a real return
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:10.380]   of 7% or so. Bonds are close to 2%, and cash is pretty close to zero. So, based on market
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.940]   history, 2% real and 0% real are conservative. But, I think when setting expectations for
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.180]   the future, you have to take the present into account, right? So, one of my favorite ones,
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.580]   Nick, I'm sure you've seen this, is the John Bogle expected returns formula. So, he takes
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.380]   the dividend yield plus earnings growth plus or minus the change in P/E ratio. Current
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.540]   dividend yield for the U.S. stock market is 1.7%. Dividends have grown 2% over the
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.100]   rate of inflation over the last 100 years. Historical earnings growth is 3% real. So,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:43.620]   let's call it 5% as your baseline, right? And then, no one can predict the change in
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.880]   P/E ratio, because that's how people feel. No one knows what people are going to be willing
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.980]   to pay for stocks in the years ahead, right? But, do you think that 0% for bonds as a real
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.340]   is realistic? Do you think that's too low, or do you think that's about right?
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.260]   I mean, it's tough to say. Like, right now, maybe it is. But, like, over the long term,
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.660]   I expect there to be some real return there. I expect it to be like, you know, I think
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.340]   most of history was like, you know, 1% to 2%. You were looking at 2% to 4% nominal,
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:15.380]   probably 1% to 2% real. And so, 0% to 1% right now is probably what we'll expect going forward,
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.940]   but I don't know. I mean, it's really time period specific, right? So, I want to hope
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.660]   that there's going to be some real return there, but there's no guarantee. And then,
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:28.500]   on equities, yeah, I think I usually plan for 4% to 5% real, and there's a lot of data
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.620]   that shows that across countries, even. Across a lot of other countries, you'll see like
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.860]   4% to 5% real is probably a fair estimate.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.260]   Yeah. So, John, throw this on the table. A lot of people say, "Well, all the returns
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.060]   on financial markets has come because of disinflation and interest rates falling since 1980." So,
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:48.880]   I looked at 1928 to 1980. What did stocks, bonds, and cash do? You can see it was a little
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.620]   over 5.5% real for stocks, and bonds and cash were actually about the same, and they were
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.460]   about 0% real. Now, it's important to remember that this is during a period that includes
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.140]   the Great Depression and World War II and the war in Vietnam and all sorts of other
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.100]   crashes and recessions in bear markets. So, I wanted to look at a period where things
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.460]   were pretty nasty, and you had literally the worst crash in the history of the United States
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.640]   stock market, and you still got almost 6% real in stocks. So, I know people are very
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.180]   bearish right now and don't feel very good, but maybe that time period is a little more
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.260]   representative of considering the starting valuations and interest rates and all that
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.260]   stuff. I actually do think simply keeping up with the inflation rate for bonds is not
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.820]   a bad deal, because I think you can't expect to earn the kind of returns we've earned in
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.300]   bonds for the last 40 years or whatever. That's probably not happening again. But yeah, I
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:42.020]   think to your point, 5% in stocks and 0-1 for bonds on a real basis, just keeping up
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.260]   with inflation, that makes sense to me, right? I'd sign off on that.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.900]   Lewis: Sounds good to me.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.380]   Lewis: I mean, for most people, I think being a little conservative in your planning is
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.580]   probably not the worst thing in the world, because most people are probably too aggressive.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.980]   You've seen those surveys, right, Nick? Where people think they're going to earn 12% a year
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.460]   or whatever it is. And maybe some people will say, "Well, if I'm earning 0% real, I don't
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:12.520]   want to own any bonds. I'll just have a little cash." But yeah, this is probably a good experience
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.540]   for people to go through to think through this stuff, because I'm sure a lot of people
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.060]   don't really even think through this stuff. They just kind of hope their returns will
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.700]   be great and not worry about the downside.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.220]   Wathen: Yeah, I agree.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.580]   Lewis: Seems like this kind of goes back to that Bitcoin question, too, where a lot of
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.900]   it is just about, are you going to kick yourself more for being too aggressive or for not being
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.060]   aggressive enough? And I guess that depends on risk tolerance and personality, right?
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.180]   Wathen: Well, real returns for Bitcoin, I'm expecting like 98% a year, give or take. Something
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.580]   like that. Maybe not.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.820]   Lewis: Not investment advice.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.660]   Wathen: Not quite. Alright, let's do another one.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:52.060]   Question. "I put $500 a month into a taxable account at Fidelity. In this account, my target
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:59.300]   allocation is 50% SPY, 40% QQQ, and 10% TLT. Is there any actual difference if I invest
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:07.980]   my $500 according to those percentages each month, 250 SPY, 200 QQQ, and 50 TLT, versus
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.420]   breaking down the $500 into appropriate levels in order to maintain the account's 50/40/10
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.340]   allocation? The scenario goes as follows. All three equities have gone down over the
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.660]   past few months, but QQQ has outpaced the declines. Should I be putting more than the
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.820]   40% of my monthly investment into QQQ, given its recent performance, in an attempt to hit
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:34.300]   the 40% allocation, or should I just rebalance the entire portfolio twice a year on January
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.900]   1st and July 1st?"
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.620]   Lewis: Good question here. The idea is, should you use your contributions to rebalance as
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:47.220]   you go, or should you just make it easy, automate it, and rebalance along the way? Nick, have
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.300]   you ever done any work on this, or do you have any thoughts?
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.220]   Nick: Yes, I have. I did talk about this. I've also talked about this in the book as
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:58.420]   well. Basically, because it's a taxable account, if this was a non-taxable account, you can
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.060]   rebalance as often as you want, there's no tax consequences. But because it's a taxable
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.140]   account, I do not recommend selling things and then buying something else, doing an actual
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:12.780]   rebalance, because it's a taxable event. So I do recommend doing what the person recommended,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.780]   which is like...
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.780]   [beep]
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.780]   [beep]
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.780]   [beep]
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.780]   [beep]
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.780]   [beep]
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:25.860]   Lewis: Oh, we lost you, Nick. That's a new one.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:31.100]   Maxfield: He's muted. All right, we'll keep going. All right, so the idea here, as Nick
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:38.940]   tries to figure some stuff out, because it's taxable, it matters more. When you're rebalancing,
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.220]   you're trimming some of your winners to buy some of your losers. What happens is, when
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.660]   you rebalance, you'll be locking in some gains on occasion. The idea here is, especially
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.060]   since it's a taxable account, it probably makes sense to just rebalance with those contributions.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.460]   I do this too. Even if it's a tax-deferred account, it's just a little easier. I'll up
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.140]   some of the ones that are lagging a little bit, just because it makes sense to bring
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.820]   them up, and it's easier that way than hitting it.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.500]   The one downside is, it requires a little more work, so it's not as easy to automate
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.820]   your investments along the way. But I think if you're willing to do this, especially in
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.780]   a taxable account, and you hate paying taxes -- and every time we talk with Bill Duncan,
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.860]   people hate paying taxes more than they enjoy seeing gains in their portfolio.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:26.220]   Lewis: Yeah, it's true. I think people feel like they're winning the game when they save
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   on taxes. It's kind of like, they were really smart. That's what Bill has talked about before.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.100]   You did something really smart. You tell your friends, and they're like, "Oh, I didn't."
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.440]   Everyone understands that if you pick the right stocks, they go up. I don't think people
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.300]   ever really think about the fact that just being smart about tax strategy can actually
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.360]   end up saving you a lot of money.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:54.860]   You guys have me back now? The main takeaway here is, just thinking about this, you should
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.520]   be buying the underweight asset, so in this case QQQ, instead of trying to cause a taxable
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.920]   event by selling some of the overweight and doing that. I call that an accumulation rebalance.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.560]   You're just buying over time, you're buying into the underweight thing. I think that's
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   much better.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.680]   The other thing, just on rebalancing in general, you don't have to rebalance as much as you
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.360]   think. Everyone's like, "Oh, do I need to do it twice a year or once a year?" It doesn't
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.040]   really matter. A lot of this stuff, it's luck, really. There's so much noise, there's no
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.120]   one rebalancing period that dominates. I've even written on this before, where if you
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.440]   rebalance in January versus April or July, it's complete noise. It's very difficult to
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.160]   know when's the best time to rebalance, so just do something that works for you. That's
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.880]   what I recommend.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.800]   And yeah, the less you can sell assets and the more you can just buy underweight assets,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.920]   I think that's a better policy going forward, because it's just not going to create taxable
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.080]   events, and that's the key. So that's why just keep buying, not selling.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.680]   Does anyone think that we should short Apple based on the fact that AirPods seem to die
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.280]   all the time when you're on one of these things? What do you think? Is Apple short because
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   of this?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.160]   I don't know. It's a great question.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:04.040]   What do they last? 60 minutes, 90 minutes tops? Something like that? That's what it
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   seems like.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.360]   I have my AirPods hooked up to my watch, my phone, my Mac. It's constantly pinging to
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.880]   one of those. It would be nice to just make it easy. Anyway, thanks for joining, Nick.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.480]   Remember, if you haven't read Nick's book, One More Plug, just keep buying. I love it
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.120]   because it's a mix of personal finance and investing, and I think you need both of those
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.180]   if you're going to succeed. Remember, if you're listening to us in podcast form, leave a review
