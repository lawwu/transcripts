[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we continue our disability income insurance series with
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.360]   a discussion of disability insurance needs analyses, how to figure out the appropriate
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.560]   benefit amounts and what benefit amounts are available.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.000]   We're going to talk about group insurance and individual insurance.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   We discuss the definitions of disability within an individual disability insurance policy.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.320]   If we have time, we'll get into specific provisions of policies that you may or may not want.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   In theory, we might have time to talk about taxation of premiums and benefits.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:55.320]   Yes, Joshua Sheets, the ever optimistic show host, thinking that we're going to get to
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.320]   all that in the course of today's show.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   Welcome to the show.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320]   This is the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   This is the show where we work hard to talk about everything you need to know to live
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   a rich and meaningful life now while also building a plan for financial freedom in 10
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320]   years or less.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:22.400]   And we continue our risk management disability income insurance series right now.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.840]   With the first episode of this series, episode number 337, I gave you my sales pitch for
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280]   why I think you should buy disability income insurance with a special emphasis on the value
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.840]   of long-term disability insurance.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.600]   In episode 339, we continued the series talking about why it's so hard to compare disability
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.360]   insurance policies to one another.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.320]   We talked about the differences and how you should decide whether to buy long-term disability
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.200]   insurance or short-term disability insurance.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.320]   We discussed available benefit periods, two years, five years, to age 65, to age 70, etc.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.040]   We talked about the elimination periods, two weeks, 45 days, 90 days, six months, one year,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.840]   and how to think through those options.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then we talked about the different continuance provisions in a disability insurance policy.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.680]   We talked about the word and the definition of non-cancelable, guaranteed renewable, conditionally
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.680]   renewable.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.160]   I explained what those policy terms mean.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.400]   And today, we continue with the nuts and bolts here of talking about how you can make good
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.480]   disability income insurance decisions by, again, talking about those things that I mentioned
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   in the beginning.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.240]   I'm going to do this show here for about 45 minutes to an hour.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   We'll see how many of these things I get through.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.560]   If not, I might need to wrap up and go on to another show.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.240]   But let's start first with a needs analysis.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.800]   One of the things that I haven't talked about is how to figure out the appropriate amount
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.280]   of disability insurance that you need.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.040]   There are different benefit amounts that are available to you.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.960]   And in general, my suggestions and advice to you are simply to get as much as you can
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.120]   get, especially at an early age.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.740]   If you are young in your career, young in your life cycle, and here I'm thinking of
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.320]   somebody in their 20s, 30s, maybe somebody with a young family, this type of profile
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   of a young family just kind of getting things started off, this is where disability income
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.800]   insurance is the most important because statistically speaking, it's likely that you have higher
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.320]   expenses and lower assets and savings at this stage of life.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.040]   This is when disability income insurance is the most important because this is the stage
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.080]   of life that your income is your biggest asset.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.360]   As you advance through your expected working life, and there's no hard and fast line to
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.960]   this, a 60-year-old can be just as broke as a 30-year-old and a 30-year-old can have twice
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.400]   or three times as much money as a 60-year-old.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.960]   But in general, as you are working throughout your lifetime, you will have the opportunity
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.740]   to earn more money and accumulate more wealth as you continue through your working lifetime.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.660]   So later in life, you should be able to accumulate more assets.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.480]   You will reach a point in time at which your assets are more important than your income.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.400]   You'll also reach a point in time where you know what your expenses are and they're more
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.000]   likely to be relatively stable.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.080]   A 55-year-old empty nesting couple has a much better idea of what their expenses are than
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.900]   a young family looking at, "Okay, how much is my 12-year-old going to need of high school
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.320]   expenses and what am I going to do about college and what am I going to do about private school
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.720]   and all these other things?"
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   So when figuring out the appropriate amount of insurance to have in the beginning, the
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.720]   answer is pretty simple.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.320]   Get as much as you can get.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   It's that simple.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.040]   Get as much as you can get.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   However, you will have the restraint or the constraint that there's a certain amount that
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.120]   you'll be able to get.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.040]   We'll talk about that and then I'll explain to you how you do a needs analysis.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.960]   The insurance companies are not going to let you have an unlimited amount of disability
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.720]   income insurance because they are on the hook if you become disabled.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.640]   Same thing with life insurance.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.520]   Because disability and life insurance policies are not reimbursement policies but rather
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.680]   are indemnity policies, there's a risk to the insurance company if they overinsure you.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   The difference between a reimbursement policy and an indemnity policy is simple.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   A reimbursement policy reimburses you for any specific charges incurred, for any specific
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.880]   costs incurred.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.040]   And so the risk to an insurance company is less under a reimbursement policy because
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.680]   there's a simple way of identifying the amount and you don't have any extra motivation to
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.240]   somehow put yourself in a situation where you're going to get more compensation.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.560]   An indemnity policy is one which pays you out a certain amount of money that is not
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.120]   necessarily due to any amount of loss.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.400]   So life insurance policies and disability income insurance policies are indemnity policies
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.260]   where the amount of your reimbursement is pre-negotiated.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.720]   The risk here is simplest to explain within the context of life insurance.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.680]   Pretend that you make $10,000 a year and you go out and you're able to buy a $10 million
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.880]   life insurance policy and you're feeling thoughts of depression, you're experiencing suicidal
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.360]   thoughts, you're just looking at your family and your situation, you're saying, "You know
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   what?
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   I'm a failure as a father.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.920]   I want to make sure that my family is taken care of.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.160]   I've got this $10 million policy and I'm only making $10,000 a year.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.080]   I think it'll help my family more if I commit suicide and give them $10 million than if
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.520]   I stick around and only give them $10,000 a year."
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.880]   This would be a very clear example of how with an indemnity policy, which is what a
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.920]   life insurance policy is, if this event happens, in this case death, then the beneficiaries
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.240]   will be indemnified $10 million.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.680]   You can see the risk that puts on the insurance company.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.120]   So the way they handle this with life insurance is that if you were making $10,000 a year,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.800]   you could not go out and get a $10 million life insurance policy.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.480]   You would need to be making a lot of money.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.360]   Maybe you could get a $50,000 life insurance policy and now you're simply saying – well,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   actually, it would be more than that.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.600]   It would probably be about 10 times.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.280]   You could get up to about a couple hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy, but
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.560]   you wouldn't be able to get a $10 million policy.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.280]   So now you can imagine that same person depressed, feeling suicidal, wondering what to do and
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.160]   they're saying, "Well, I've only got $100,000.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.440]   Whether I make $10,000 a year or they get $100,000 of life insurance, that's not going
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   to change their life.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.040]   Maybe I'll just keep on working and see if I can make things better."
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.320]   So the same thing applies with disability insurance.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.600]   If you're making $10,000 a year – and I'm just using extreme numbers to illustrate
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.660]   the concept.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.040]   If you're making $10,000 a year but you're able to get a disability insurance policy
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.240]   that will pay you if you're disabled $10,000 a month, well, now all of a sudden you might
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.800]   be looking at your mountain bike and thinking, "Hmm.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.040]   If I could figure out how to ride that off the side of a cliff in such a way that it
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.000]   didn't kill me and it didn't hurt me too badly but it made me disabled, maybe that
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.240]   would be better to be somewhat disabled but get $10,000 a month because right now I'm
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   only making $10,000 a year," or whatever scenario that you want to come up with.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.880]   And so that's the risk that the insurance company has to face.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.320]   So you're always going to be limited based upon the amount of insurance you can get by
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.280]   the insurance company.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.000]   Now the first thing to recognize is generally here where we're talking about individual
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.240]   disability insurance policies, without getting into the taxation, you do need to know that
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.960]   generally with individual disability insurance policies, you're going to be paying the policy
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   premiums without taking a tax deduction.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.760]   So you're going to be using after income tax dollars to pay for the premiums.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.280]   But your benefit on an individual disability income insurance policy will generally be
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.600]   received free of income taxes.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.440]   So there can be a significant benefit there for you.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.760]   If you're making $3,000 in normal employment, well, remember the first thing off your $3,000
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.720]   is going to come off your Medicare and employment taxes.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:29.400]   So you're going to lose right off the bat 7.65% of that money which will be $230 coming
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.040]   off of a $3,000 payment.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:38.440]   You're going to lose 7.65% if you're employed to your employment taxes and your Medicare
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.480]   taxes.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.600]   So that's going to be a significant decrease.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.200]   If you were self-employed, you'd lose 15.3% right off the bat.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   Plus you're also going to lose your income taxes.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.720]   Depending on your income tax rate, those may or may not be a lot of money.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:58.240]   So generally when you're at a lower rate of earnings, you can basically get as much insurance
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.840]   as you would get if you were working.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:08.000]   It will sometimes almost cover 100% of your working after tax income.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.840]   So some simple examples would be if you were earning $3,000 a month, you could probably
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:21.800]   get $2,400 of – maybe $2,200 to $2,400 of disability insurance benefit which would practically
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.400]   be equivalent to what you're making on an after tax basis if you were earning $3,000
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.900]   a month as your salary.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:36.600]   Now as your income goes up, you'll be able to get more disability income insurance measured
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.080]   in dollar terms but you'll be able to get less disability income insurance measured
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.200]   in percentage terms.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.920]   So somebody making $30,000 a month, there's no possibility that they're going to be able
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.280]   to reach the same percentage of their income replaced.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.200]   The $3,000 a month earner might be able to cover 100% of their current after tax income
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.000]   with a disability policy.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.520]   The $30,000 a month earner would probably only be able to cover maybe 50% of their after
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.060]   tax income.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.840]   But the dollar amount of course, 50% of $30,000 after tax would be what?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.360]   About $13,000, $12,000 to $14,000 depending on how we ran the math.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.000]   So the dollar amount of $12,000 to $14,000 a month of disability benefit would be much
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.840]   higher than the $2,200 a month but the percentage is lower.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.600]   So there's no way that you are going to know this without asking the insurance agent
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   to calculate what's available to you and what options you have available to you.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.320]   So that's the simplest way to know how much you can get.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.360]   The insurance agent will have a program of some sort where it would be relatively simple.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.440]   If you're an employee, they'll just plug in, "Hey, I'm making $72,000 a year as an employee."
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.700]   You just pop that in the computer and you have the answer right there.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.140]   If you are self-employed, if you're a business owner or if your financial situation is more
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.940]   complicated, then the agent themselves will probably not be able to tell you.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.960]   What you'll have to do is go through what's called financial underwriting.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.440]   So financial underwriting for – so all disability insurance policies when you buy them are underwritten
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.600]   on a financial basis and also on a health basis.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.220]   The health basis is relatively simple.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.240]   Just like life insurance, when you go to apply for life insurance, the health underwriting
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.880]   requirements vary depending on the amount of insurance that you're buying.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.880]   If you're buying a very small amount of insurance, I don't remember any numbers,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.160]   but let's just say a few hundred dollars a month, you may just simply have to answer
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.920]   some medical questions and they'll pull your doctor records to check your medical
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   history with your doctor.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.320]   You go up a little bit higher, you may do a tongue swab.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.200]   The tongue swab is where they check for nicotine and different things.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   The insurance agent usually will do that.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.880]   You go up a little bit more and any normally employed amounts of disability insurance,
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.560]   you're going to do – a nurse will come out to your house and they'll do a blood
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.240]   draw, they'll do a urine sample and they'll check your height and your weight and your
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.200]   blood pressure and things like that.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.920]   As you go up the ranks in terms of higher and higher amounts of insurance, then the
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.000]   medical underwriting requirements get to become more and more and more.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.640]   So at the higher levels, if you're a practicing physician earning half a million dollars a
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.680]   year, you'll be visited by a physician, you'll have a physician health review,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.120]   they'll do an EKG, they'll do comprehensive tests on you, etc.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.960]   So the more insurance you apply for, the more stringent the medical underwriting requirements
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   will be.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.640]   But you'll also always go through financial underwriting requirements and it will be the
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   same thing.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.680]   If you're a simple employee at say earning $60,000 a year, all you need to submit is
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.840]   a pay stub and make a statement of what your income has been the last couple of years.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.360]   However, if you're applying for a much higher amount of insurance, it would not be unusual
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.380]   for the underwriters to require three years of tax returns including all of your supporting
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:57.920]   schedules and other information or to require current financial statements.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.940]   In some cases, those financial statements could be required to be audited or signed
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.060]   off on by your accountant.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.200]   So as you go up, the financial underwriting requirements become more.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.440]   When you are trying to do financial underwriting on a disability case, it can be very tricky
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.640]   for some people in certain occupations.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.360]   So for business owners, it can be very challenging because some things are coverable and some
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.920]   things aren't.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.600]   One of the challenges is that many business owners need much more disability insurance
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:32.060]   than they can get, especially if your business is not showing a high profit on paper.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.160]   When you're running a business and when you're investing in the initial stages, often there's
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.440]   a difference between what your profit is on paper versus what your profit could be and
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.840]   actually is because you're reinvesting heavily into the business.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.160]   Well, that's great from a tax savings perspective, but it's not great for the perspective of
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.120]   getting disability income insurance.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.200]   It's also not great for applying for a mortgage.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.560]   Those are the two places where you really get hurt when you're a business owner and
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.160]   you're not paying a lot of taxes because you're not showing a lot of income.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.480]   So you've always got to be careful with that.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.640]   If you have other forms of income, so let's say that you've built a portfolio of real
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.220]   estate and you're receiving rental incomes from your real estate or you have a large
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.120]   amount of dividend paying stocks, the underwriter will take those things into account as well
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.680]   and they will count against the amount of disability insurance that you're able to get.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.720]   Another reason why in general if you're just getting started and you have a job, get as
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.480]   much disability insurance as you can get because if you were to fast forward down the road
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.240]   and have say five rental houses all paying you money every month, you wouldn't be able
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.800]   to get as much disability insurance as you can get in the beginning.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.040]   Obviously you wouldn't need it as much, but you wouldn't be able to get as much.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   So that's how – those are the major ways the benefit amount is determined, just simply
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.580]   by the underwriter.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.520]   You can do a needs analysis.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.400]   This is simple with computer software.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.100]   What you essentially do is you put it into a financial planning software package.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.320]   You put in your income.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.500]   You put in your expenses.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.600]   You mark out which of those expenses need to be paid during a time of disability and
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.000]   which don't.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.560]   For example, you might say I want to pull back on some discretionary amounts of expenses
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.760]   but I would keep these other essential expenses.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.520]   Those things are all possible.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.560]   In general, all of the computer programs do it.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.360]   Most people that are buying disability insurance, it's just not all that relevant.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.200]   It's really not all that relevant, which is why I don't spend a lot of time on it.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.680]   Essentially what a disability insurance needs analysis will demonstrate is that you have
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.240]   a need for disability insurance and even if you put in as much insurance as you could
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:46.640]   get, most people still won't be fully covered for as much as they really need.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.880]   The only time that the disability insurance needs analysis would be very, very helpful
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:58.480]   would be if you have a large nest egg of money and you're trying to figure out, "Okay,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.480]   can this get me through?
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.640]   If I have this lump sum of money, if I were disabled, let's say I had a disability insurance
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.600]   policy that was going to cover me for the next 20 years, would I then be okay with this
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.320]   pot of money for the rest of my life?"
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.960]   That is where I like disability insurance needs analysis because in the software packages,
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:21.560]   it's relatively simple to figure out what do I do with retirement and how do we achieve
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.680]   retirement.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.320]   One of the major costs of disability for those who become disabled is the current cost of
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.960]   disability.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.560]   But the other major cost is the future cost of disability.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.920]   What I mean is if I became disabled for a period of say five to ten years, and here
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.280]   we're talking about a significant disability.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.880]   This is unlikely statistically speaking, but it does happen from time to time.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.560]   If I became disabled for say five years, I would have all of my current expenses for
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.280]   those five years, but I also have the cost of retirement or the fact that I haven't been
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:00.040]   able to save and compound money for those five years towards that retirement.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.120]   People who become disabled, even if it's for a relatively short amount of time, often find
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.920]   their financial plan significantly disrupted.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.760]   If they don't have insurance, then all of a sudden they start tapping their assets much
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.300]   more quickly than someone else does.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.920]   This results in bad effects.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.600]   That's where the needs analysis software can be simple and it can be helpful as it demonstrates
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   that need.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.360]   I've done that many times in sales situations where somebody says, "I don't need disability
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   income insurance.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   I have a million dollars."
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.200]   I say, "Okay, that's fine, but let's run the scenario of today with your million dollars.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.400]   If you keep working, yeah, you're going to be rich, but let's run the scenario if you're
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.120]   disabled for five years and let's see what happens to the million dollars."
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.720]   All of a sudden, you find the million dollars is not quite as comforting as you thought
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.520]   it was because now you're pulling out $5,000 a month for the next five years and your retirement
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.680]   shortfall becomes huge.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.440]   That's what the needs analysis can show that to you.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.920]   Finally, you can choose amount of disability insurance based upon a certain thing that
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   you want to cover.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   For example, you have a certain obligation, a certain debt, a certain stream of payments
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.560]   that you're desiring to cover.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.040]   I will try to do a – I might do in the future a show on just all the different types of
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.880]   disability insurance because there are many different kinds, but you can choose some of
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.600]   these based upon that amount.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.920]   For example, if you were purchasing a disability overhead expense insurance policy as a business
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.360]   owner, these policies function to cover the expenses of your business.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.760]   You might just simply look down and say, "Hey, I've got $6,000 a month of business expenses,"
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.240]   and you just choose the amount of insurance based upon that.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   Simple.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.840]   We're going to cover $6,000 a month for 12 months and you're covered.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.080]   That's how you choose the amount.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.040]   Now, let's talk about group insurance merged with individual insurance.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.000]   Most people who are working in mainstream jobs at large companies have access to some
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.720]   kind of group disability insurance program.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.800]   The challenge here is that many workers in the United States of America work in smaller
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   firms.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.680]   It's much less likely that this type of program will be open to you in a smaller firm than
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.000]   if you're working in a larger firm.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.200]   How do you figure out what to do with the benefits between them?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.880]   The way to do it perfectly is to first look and understand what are the benefits that
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.960]   are actually provided by the group disability insurance policy.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:32.440]   Here we would want to get into the actual questions for the policy of how do we actually
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.560]   get paid if we're disabled?
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.440]   What are the policy provisions?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.880]   This is difficult information to get, especially without an insurance agent because most people
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880]   just don't know.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.840]   Your human resources person is not going to know.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.200]   They'll have to call the insurance company and get the questions answered.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.440]   I'll go ahead and tell you what the questions are that I would always send a client.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.000]   I always had a written statement.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.880]   I'll put this on the site in some way.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.920]   But I always had a written statement prepared for my clients.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.840]   The first stage of financial planning is I would send them this list of questions and
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.240]   try to get all the details of their group benefits.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.600]   So the group long-term disability, the group life insurance, any group long-term care,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   questions about the 401(k), questions about the pensions, et cetera.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.000]   The questions about the disability policy are the most important.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.160]   I'll read them to you and explain why they are important.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.000]   The first question is, "Does our company provide any long-term disability insurance?"
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.420]   That one is pretty simple.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.680]   But many of you do not know if you have something available to you or not.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.400]   Next question, "Am I enrolled?"
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.760]   Seems silly but it's a huge deal because most people have some kind of disability insurance
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.240]   available to them.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.520]   But many of them are simply not enrolled.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.160]   So you have to be enrolled in order for it to work.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.880]   Next, "When does the long-term disability benefit begin?"
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.200]   And I have little options.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.000]   Usually it's either 90 or 180 days after being disabled, usually 90.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.840]   "What percentage of my income does it cover?"
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.880]   Group disability insurance policies will often put that number in there and it'll be usually
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:16.280]   60%, sometimes 67% or a different number, but sometimes 50%, but often 60%.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.880]   Next question, "How is income defined?"
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.040]   Big question here is, "Is it base salary only or is it my total compensation?"
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.320]   For example, base and bonus.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.200]   Some disability insurance policies will cover you based upon your base salary.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.240]   And for some of you, that's all you earn.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   But many people, especially high-income earners, have their compensation decided as a formula
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.760]   between a base and a bonus.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.880]   And if your disability insurance policy does not reflect that bonus, you might be significantly
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   underinsured.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.720]   This can be a real challenge.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.920]   Now, some disability policies do cover bonus.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   There's no reason why they can't.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:04.440]   But many times, these benefits that are provided in a group long-term disability contract are
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.120]   not quite as comprehensive as you might like because often your employer is picking up
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.120]   the tab for this.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.240]   But most people are not aware of what's in their disability insurance policy.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.080]   People are quick to criticize and lobby their employer for a great health insurance policy
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.840]   because they use that.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   But very few people ever use their long-term disability insurance policy.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.040]   And so the long-term disability insurance policy is one place where an employer can
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.840]   offer something so that there's something there, but not actually offer something great
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.680]   and save a little bit of money.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.840]   And I'm not trying to say employers are being mean to employees, just simply that employees
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.400]   don't usually raise a ruckus about their long-term disability benefits.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.320]   So we need to know, how is income defined?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.040]   Is it base and bonus?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.800]   Is it total compensation?
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.760]   If you are a commission-based salesperson, how is your income defined?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.800]   Next, is there a maximum monthly benefit?
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   Oftentimes there'll be a maximum monthly benefit of $5,000 or $10,000 a month.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.180]   For many people, that's not a problem.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.320]   For some of you, that might be a significant problem because you're underinsured.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.560]   Next question is, who pays the premium for the coverage?
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.260]   Who pays the premium for the coverage?
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.040]   That's important so that we get to taxation.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.680]   If your employer is paying the premium for the coverage, then the benefit when received
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.040]   by you after being disabled will be taxable.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   So if the employer is paying the premium, because the benefit's taxable, the individual
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.840]   policy, you'll be able to get a higher amount of insurance with your individual policy than
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.900]   the other way around.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.880]   Is the benefit taxable when received by me?
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   That's just a different way of asking it.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.360]   There are a couple of interesting tax rules where sometimes it may or may not be, but
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.360]   let's skip that for now.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.200]   Is there a partial disability benefit?
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.760]   And this, as far as I'm concerned, we're going in just a moment to definitions of disability
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.640]   for individuals with disability policies.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:05.320]   But as far as I'm concerned, the most important disability benefit to have is a partial disability
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   benefit.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.880]   And this is often the biggest lack in group disability policies.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.540]   Many times the group disability policy will have a clause for a total disability.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.540]   But think about it.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:24.680]   Many of you have pretty safe jobs, and it would take a lot for you not to be able to
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.040]   do anything related to your job.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   But it wouldn't take all that much for you to be only able to work 50% of your time at
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   your job.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.320]   Well, does being able to work 50% of your time at your job qualify you for a disability
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.600]   payment under the terms of your disability insurance policy?
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.040]   It's a big deal.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.800]   We'll come back to that in a moment.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.880]   Next is the policy, have a cost of living provision after I am disabled.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.440]   This can be a big deal.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.240]   You're getting $3,000 a month, but all of a sudden you're 30 years old.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.760]   I was just reading – before I hit record, I was just reading about a story of this guy
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   who was – where was it?
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   It doesn't matter.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.880]   I think it was California.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:12.480]   But reading about a guy who was arrested by the police and they pulled him out of the
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.320]   police car in handcuffs.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.040]   He fell on his head and he was paralyzed from the neck down.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.360]   He was an MMA fighter which was probably why they were pretty rough with him because his
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.960]   arrest was probably pretty difficult.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.080]   I didn't read all the details of the case.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.200]   But point was he was pulled out of a police cruiser.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.640]   He was pulled on his head and he was paralyzed from the chest down.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   I think I said from the waist.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   Excuse me.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.760]   From the chest down, no longer able to function.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.720]   Well obviously he's totally disabled.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.360]   But things like that can happen.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   You can hurt yourself and you can still do some work but you just can't do everything
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.720]   that you were doing before.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.640]   Or you can still work and do everything you were doing before and you just can't do
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.680]   it for as much time.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.480]   Now you're 30 years old.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.040]   You're 30 years old and as a 30-year-old, you've got a long time horizon.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.480]   So say you're collecting – this guy, if he had a disability insurance policy, let's
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.040]   say he's collecting $3,000 a month from his policy.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.480]   Well, $3,000 a month today is a livable income level.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.040]   30 years from now, that won't be a livable income level.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.600]   So that's important.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.440]   The next is the benefit reduced by any social security payments I may receive.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.200]   Sometimes in order to reduce the risk, there – it exists on policies and you can put
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.880]   this on your individual policy, something called a social insurance substitute benefit
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.160]   where your amount of your benefit will be reduced if you're receiving social security
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.520]   payments.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.200]   So this can be a substantial thing as well.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.040]   So those are the questions that you should ask about your group disability insurance
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.040]   policy.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.520]   The point of those questions is to understand what you actually have.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.440]   I've reviewed hundreds of policies that are great and I've reviewed hundreds of
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.160]   policies that are OK and I've reviewed a lot of policies that were terrible.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.960]   They just – yeah, they were called long-term disability insurance but the protection for
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.860]   the individual was minimal.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.260]   Now here's the major challenge.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.880]   If your employer is paying for your disability insurance, you can't opt out.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.680]   You actually – you usually can't opt out even if it's terrible.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.880]   I tried it one time with a client and the policy coverage was so terrible.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.760]   I said you should opt out of this thing and just get an individual policy to cover the
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   whole amount.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.240]   They couldn't do it.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.280]   What you can do is if you're not enrolled, don't enroll until you find out the details
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.880]   of it and you can't find this stuff out from the little sales thing.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's not going to tell you that.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.120]   You can sometimes find it if you have the comprehensive booklet.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.000]   But in general, this is where you have to sit down with an insurance agent and let them
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.080]   read through it and find it or you'll have to get on the phone and ask them these questions.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.800]   Again, I will post these questions at the website and you can use it to email it to
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.320]   your HR coordinate, HR benefit person.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.480]   If you're a financial planner, feel free to steal my questions.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.680]   This was always a standard thing.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.840]   The first time I ever met somebody, I always saved this on my phone as an attachment and
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.800]   we were going to get into group disability – group benefits.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.680]   I just said you don't – unless you know, just email this to your HR coordinator and
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   send me their answers.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.240]   It worked really, really well to get a good, accurate understanding of what benefits somebody
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.280]   actually has.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.600]   When you have a group policy in force, the insurance company, if you're applying for
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.720]   an individual policy, will take that policy and they'll calculate the amount that you
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:27.400]   have, calculate your income and calculate how much they're willing to offer to you.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:33.920]   If you don't have a group disability policy in force, then you should usually go and get
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.600]   an individual disability policy first because you'll be able to cover the maximum amount
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.840]   of your income versus the group policy.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.120]   Now oftentimes, your group policy will be cheaper than your individual disability insurance
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   policy.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.000]   Many times, you'll pay much less money.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.680]   It wouldn't be surprising to me if somebody were to call me up and say, "Joshua, I can
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.760]   buy group disability insurance policy for $23 a month and you're telling me this individual
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.520]   disability policy at $97 a month.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.240]   Obviously, I should go with the group."
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.160]   Well, don't go so fast.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.740]   The reason is you can't make that assessment accurately until you know what the group policy
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.720]   is and what the terms of that policy are.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.520]   This is usually the major mistake people make.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.200]   They jump on the group policy because it's cheap.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.000]   But when actually look at it, we all of a sudden find out, "Well, yeah, it's cheap,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.840]   but it doesn't have a partial disability benefit.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.820]   It doesn't have a cost of living adjustment after disability.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.480]   It's capped at $5,000 a month and it doesn't cover your bonus."
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:42.880]   Yes, it's cheap and it's $20 a month, but it is in no way comparable to this really
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.000]   good disability policy over here that's $140 a month.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.520]   With disability insurance, there's no way to cut the corners.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.080]   You've got to actually compare it based upon what's in the policy.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.360]   In a moment when I go into some more of these definitions of disability, you'll see how
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.220]   as an insurance agent, man, you tell me how much you want to spend and I can build you
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.620]   an insurance policy that matches that.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.680]   You can't start by shopping on price for disability insurance.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.800]   You've got to start of what you want and what's important, what options are necessary because
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.520]   I can take a disability insurance policy.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.680]   It's $185 a month and I can drop this benefit and strip this other one out and let's go
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.120]   to the cheap option of this other benefit and let's shorten up the benefit period and
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.640]   let's stretch out the elimination period and hey, I took this $180 policy and it's now
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.000]   $32 a month.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.560]   Is that really what you should do?
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.120]   The obvious answer is no.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.960]   You should start and understand the benefits that you want, that you need, and that are
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:44.920]   important for your situation based upon your financial assets, etc. and then go to the
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   price.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.240]   Obviously, also, we always have to fit this into the amount of money that's available.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.680]   Money is, for most of us, the amount of income that we have is not infinite.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:01.280]   If we're working with a budget of $300, we've got to fit all of the needs into that and
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.400]   that's where again, you might say, "Well, I'd like to have a benefit period to age 65
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.960]   but I can't do that and get disability insurance for my spouse and get life insurance for me
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.200]   and get life insurance for my spouse and have any money to save to an emergency fund.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   I can't do all those things."
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.960]   So what we're going to do is for now, we're going to shorten up the benefit period from
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.400]   age 65 to five years and that will allow us to get life insurance for everybody.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.680]   As an insurance agent, you always got to fit everything into the budget that you actually
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.040]   have.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.360]   Budgets can be flexible.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.680]   Sometimes if you're a client, sometimes the budget that you tell the insurance agent you
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.960]   have and the budget you could actually come up with are different but at the end of the
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.520]   day, we're going to have a hard number of budget.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.720]   If you're spending more money on your insurance than you are on your food budget, you're generally
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.800]   not going to be happy with your insurance agent.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.440]   Most people are not happy with that.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.800]   I think those are the major things you need to know about group insurance versus individual
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.880]   insurance.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   Those are the key things.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.040]   Obviously, an individual disability policy will go with you when you lose your job.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.360]   A group insurance policy won't.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.480]   So that's important also.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.440]   Now let's talk about the definition of disability.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:23.520]   By far, the most important feature of a disability insurance policy is going to be the definition
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.720]   of disability.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.160]   Before I give you some of the language, let me just ask you.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.240]   If I came to you, pretend that I'm your insurance agent, I want the best for you and you're
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.520]   telling me, "Joshua, I'm disabled," how would I prove or how would you prove to me that you're
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   disabled?
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.040]   What would be the actual definition of disability?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.560]   Let's come up with a couple of simple examples here.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.040]   Example number one, you go skiing with your family, you run into a tree and you break
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.240]   a leg.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.200]   Are you disabled in your job?
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.740]   Example number two, you go through a time period of severe depression and you're not
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.640]   able to function effectively.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.340]   Are you disabled?
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.520]   Example number three, you are diagnosed with cancer and it's a significant form of cancer.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.480]   Now you're going through chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and you're working through with
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.040]   your oncologist trying to beat cancer.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.080]   Are you disabled from your job?
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   Example number four, I don't know, what would be a very common thing?
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:46.520]   Just insert any accident, illness, you lose an eye, you were in a car accident and you're
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.960]   paralyzed from the waist down.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.200]   You bang your head and you have a concussion, you're out of work.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.160]   What would it take for you to prove to me that you're disabled?
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:04.240]   You can start to see how the most important thing is the actual definition of disability
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:10.440]   because under two different definitions of disability, let's talk about this in terms
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.960]   of the paralyzed from the waist down.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   If you're earning your income as an electrician or a carpenter, it's very likely that you're
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.840]   now disabled from being able to work as a carpenter if you're disabled from the waist
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.680]   down.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   But does that necessarily mean that you can't get a job working as an accountant if you
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:42.200]   have the mental ability to do it?
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:48.840]   You can start to see that we've got to figure out what am I disabled from and how disabled
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   am I?
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.600]   It becomes more difficult.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.280]   The first thing that we want to talk about is what is the best definition of disability?
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   The best definition of disability will be what's called own occupation disability.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   In the insurance lingo, you'll hear this talked about as own-oc versus any-oc.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.680]   Own-oc is own occupation.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.560]   Any-oc is any occupation.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.440]   Own occupation, the best definition of total disability for own occupation would be the
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   inability of you, the insured, to engage in your own occupation.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:35.040]   It doesn't matter if you could go and retrain and do something else.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.880]   If I'm disabled from what I'm doing now, my own occupation, I want to be considered as
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.520]   being disabled.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.280]   Really, really important.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:52.480]   People with highly specialized jobs for which they've trained a tremendous amount of time
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.400]   will appreciate this to a very high degree.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:03.400]   The most common people who actually appreciate this hugely are physicians because they know
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:08.860]   I've spent a tremendous number of years studying and learning and practicing in this very highly
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.160]   specialized skill.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.720]   Therefore, it's very important to me that I be able to do this very highly specialized
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.800]   skill.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   If at all possible, you want to be protected from disability in your own occupation.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:28.000]   What about any occupation?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.360]   There are a couple of ways that any occupation could be determined.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.920]   These terms that I'm giving here will vary among companies, but these are generalized
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.120]   terms.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.240]   You'll just have to figure out with the insurance agent you're working with and with the company
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.200]   that you're working with which specific terms are being used.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.040]   You definitely want to get an own occupation if you can.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.920]   The next one would be an ENEOC.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.500]   This would be where you're considered to be disabled if you're unable to engage in any
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   occupation for which you're qualified by reason of training, education, or experience.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:09.440]   The idea here is to have some level of appropriateness.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.700]   This would be called a modified any occupation or a modified own occupation.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.360]   The idea is to say to some degree we're going to take into account your experience and training.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.560]   Yes, we know that you could go and sit at the front desk of a condo and buzz people
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.680]   in and buzz people out, but it needs to be any occupation for which you're reasonably
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.400]   suited due to your training or your education or your experience.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.760]   If you've got a master's degree and you've been highly trained in a specialized occupation
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.360]   just because you can go sit in front of a condo and buzz the buzzer to let people in,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.240]   we're not going to say that that's what you need to do.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.380]   That would be called either, again, depending on whether we're doing any occupation or modified
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.040]   any occupation or modified own occupation.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   Then the final leg of the three, which is the worst, would be truly any occupation.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.080]   This would be get close.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:09.120]   When I've said in the past that I place no emphasis or value whatsoever on Social Security
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.840]   as far as the likelihood of receiving Social Security disability payments, this is why.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.000]   We're getting here to like the any occupation definition as defined by Social Security.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.160]   Here is their definition of disability.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   Social Security defines you as disabled when you have the inability to engage in any substantial
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:35.360]   gainful activity by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment,
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.760]   which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.240]   for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.000]   That's the technical Social Security definition.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.520]   I'll read it again to you.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:55.520]   The inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity, the inability to engage
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:05.440]   in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determined physical or mental
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   impairment, which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.240]   to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.440]   Basically, you got to not be able to do anything and it's got to last and be expected to last
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:27.440]   for a long time, like at least a year, or you better be expected to die from this problem.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   This is a serious cost to you.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.840]   This is really not the type of disability insurance that most people want to have.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.840]   Hey, but you can get it.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   It's cheap.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.360]   It's what Social Security disability is.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   This definition of disability is the most important.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:55.160]   Now, there may also be specialty definitions of disability.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.240]   This is where you have to check your contract.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.440]   If you are in a specialized occupation, there may be a specialized definition of disability,
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:10.440]   but in general, you want to get to as close to an own occupation definition of disability,
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:17.240]   which brings us to a question of saying, "Okay, if I'm disabled, then what?"
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.760]   This is another thing you want to look at your contract to understand.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   Back in the '70s and '80s, I think they started to dry up by the '90s, but in the physician
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   marketplace, there was a major thing that happened with disability insurance policies.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:40.760]   You used to be able to buy what was called a true own occupation definition of disability
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   for as a physician.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.960]   What this meant is if I were practicing as a surgeon, as a physician, I'm considered
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.320]   to be disabled if I can't practice my surgical specialty.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.160]   Let's say I had a disability policy that covered me for $15,000 a month.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.360]   Well, this is a substantial benefit.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.160]   So, I go out and I'm out skiing and I fall and I break my hand.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.560]   Okay, well, now I can't do surgery.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   So, I'm automatically considered to be qualified and automatically considered to be disabled.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.080]   But obviously, I'm still an intelligent person.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.880]   I just broke my hand.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.200]   I could still practice other forms of medicine.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   I just can't do surgery because I can't hold the scalpel properly or I can't do the very
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.880]   fine motor controls that are necessary for my surgical specialty.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.520]   What happened is many times somebody who was in that situation would qualify as being disabled.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.800]   They would then go ahead and retrain, reskill, slightly shift their specialty and go ahead
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.960]   and earn a full physician's wage at another occupation while also collecting their $15,000
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:47.320]   a month disability benefit, income tax-free, which is pretty sweet.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:53.820]   That type of definition of disability has gotten very difficult to find, very difficult
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.320]   to actually get that true own occupation definition of disability.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.840]   And so, here's where when we get into the next thing, which is how is disability determined?
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.960]   You need to read and understand your contract because there are three major ways with most
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.240]   disability insurances policies that disability is determined.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:17.920]   You'll be considered disabled if you suffer a loss of time, a loss of duties, and then
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:24.400]   here we would get into a question, is it and, is it or, or is it and/or?
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.240]   And/or income, time, duties, income.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.400]   This is the thing that's going to prove that you suffered a disability.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.600]   So the first one is time.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.780]   Many times you want your contract to cover you if you're disabled for a period of time.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.520]   You might still be able to do all of the things that are associated with your work, but if
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.120]   you just can't do them 50 hours a week, you can only do them 20 hours a week, you want
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.260]   to be considered disabled by the policy.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.320]   Next would be duties.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.760]   You might still be able to work a full work week, but there were some duties of your job
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.920]   that you couldn't do before, excuse me, that you could do before that now you can't do.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.280]   So you want that to be covered if possible.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.600]   And then also you might suffer a loss of income.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.120]   But depending on your job, this loss of income might or might not lag the actual loss of
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.440]   time and duties.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.080]   Income is ultimately the key indicator of your disability.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.160]   Do you actually have a decrease of income?
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.840]   But sometimes, again, in many specialties, income will lag.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:27.600]   If you were in a commission-based sales job and you had a bunch of things negotiated,
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.240]   or if you were receiving payment from things in the past, your income might not be affected
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.960]   until say five months or six months after your disability.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.900]   But do you want to give up disability benefits during all those periods of time?
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:47.720]   So that's – you need to understand in your contract how that is calculated.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.540]   Some contracts and the contracts that I used to work with whenever possible would cover
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:58.400]   you for any of those three, loss of time or loss of duties or loss of income.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.240]   And usually though, you need to prove the loss of income after a period of time, so
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.240]   often something like six months.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.720]   If you were still working 20 hours a week and you – but you never had a decrease in
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.860]   income, then the insurance company would say, "Well, you're not actually disabled.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.260]   The disability policy might not pay under those circumstances."
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:23.320]   So those attributes and features of the disability policy are extremely important.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.680]   You can see now when I said I could make a policy cheap, just change it from own occupation
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.880]   to any occupation and all of a sudden now, we're going to have a major change.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.700]   Or again, that true ONOC versus modified ONOC.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.980]   True ONOC meaning that you can receive your – you can double dip.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.740]   You can get your disability benefit and you can go do other work.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.740]   Very hard to get now.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.360]   Most people are not going to be able to get that.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:53.080]   Most disability policies are what's called a modified own occupation definition of disability,
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.660]   meaning that you can be disabled but if you're earning income at something else, that's
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.300]   going to affect and offset your benefits.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.780]   It's a much fairer thing.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.180]   Fairer for the insurance company, better for the insured because you're not trying to
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.780]   negotiate something where you're going to double dip and get all this extra money.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.220]   It just sets up too many conflicts of interest and too many risks of adverse selection for
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.840]   the insurance company.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.840]   Next thing is provisions.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.220]   Here, I'm going to talk about total disability, partial disability, and presumptive total
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.540]   disability.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:25.140]   It's possible that you might be completely disabled.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.700]   It's possible.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.140]   It happens.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:34.180]   But on the grand scale of just statistical probability and likelihood, it's unlikely
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.860]   that you would be completely disabled.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.900]   I'm giving you my sales pitch that I used to give to people.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.940]   What I found as a financial advisor – any of you financial advisors listening, here's
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.260]   the number one way to overcome objections in the sales process.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.620]   Always give your client all of the objections that they're going to have before they have
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:58.060]   them and you feel like – and your client thinks that you're reading their mind.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.460]   Because people would be skeptical, especially disability insurance.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:05.020]   What's the number one thing that everyone thinks is not going to happen to them when
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.220]   they're thinking about buying disability?
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.500]   "I'm not going to get disabled."
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   Okay.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.180]   So after a while, I started realizing, "Well, this is stupid.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.820]   I have to answer this question every time."
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.820]   I would just look them right in the eye, especially men, and just say, "But the chances are,
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.900]   realistically, you're not going to get disabled, right?"
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   Okay, great.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.260]   Now we can deal with that and talk about it.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.420]   I don't have to have it lingering in the back of your mind.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:27.380]   Same thing with the idea that, "Well, I'm not going to be able to do anything."
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.180]   Again, we're the worst.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.860]   Every man would be like, "Oh, give me my laptop in a hotel room and I'll figure
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.860]   out a way to make money."
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.860]   Okay.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.900]   So I just took that and I'd always put it into my sales language.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.340]   So realistically, Mr. Prospective Client, give me a break.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.300]   It's possible, I guess, in theory, that you could be totally disabled.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:51.620]   But realistically, statistically, it's really unlikely that you could be totally disabled.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:55.140]   I bet if I gave you a laptop, even if you're in your hospital room – I think I said hotel
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.620]   room, excuse me – even if you're in your hospital room, if I gave you a laptop and
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:05.140]   a cell phone, you could probably figure out a way to make some money, couldn't you?
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.460]   Nodding along, of course, because that's what they were thinking.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.460]   Okay.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.740]   So now let's talk about that.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.700]   Total disability is important because it's possible you could get totally disabled.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:18.100]   But the most important benefit in a disability insurance policy is a partial disability benefit.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:24.340]   And the idea here is that if you suffer a partial disability, you're not totally disabled.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.380]   You just can't do some of the things that you used to do or you can't do them for
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.700]   as much time as you used to be able to do them, then you still want to be covered.
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:39.220]   This is a big deal because, again, most disabilities that people experience are partial disabilities.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.220]   Can still work.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.700]   It just can't work at all.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:47.300]   So in many policies, you'll have a sliding scale where you've got to at least be 20%
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.300]   disabled.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.420]   If you were saying, "Well, I was working 55 hours a week, but now I can only work 50
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.060]   hours a week," well, I'm sorry.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.620]   You're not that disabled.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.900]   The insurance company is not going to pay you for that.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.780]   But if you were working 40 hours a week and now your doctor has restricted you to 30 hours
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.780]   a week because of your back pain, you're facing chronic back pain that's occurring when you're
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.420]   standing and you can't work effectively anymore, that's a 25% disability.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.220]   And so if your hours are reduced, you're going to suffer a 25% loss of income.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.940]   So you want to make sure that your policy covers you for that partial disability and
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.540]   makes up that 25% loss of income.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.100]   Anywhere from 20% to 80% would be considered a partial disability.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.660]   If you get to the point where, yeah, you can work 40 hours a week.
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.660]   You were working 40 hours a week, but now you can work four, well, let's just go ahead
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:36.420]   and you're going to be considered totally disabled at that point in time.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:42.020]   So partial disability is the most important thing because most disabilities are not total
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   disabilities.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   They're partial disabilities.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.580]   There's sometimes one other benefit and I like this other benefit.
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.900]   It's called presumptive total disability.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.020]   Some of the policies I used to work with, the presumptive total disability would say
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:50:03.500]   if you lose the use of both hands, both feet, one hand, one foot, or you lose your sight,
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:09.100]   your speech, or your hearing, you'll automatically be considered to be completely disabled even
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.180]   if you're still able to work.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.100]   So again, this comes back to that example I used of paralysis.
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:18.500]   Let's say that I had a paralyzing event and I had a disability policy.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:23.220]   I could do my job right now, speaking to you through this microphone, whether I were sitting
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.100]   in a wheelchair or not.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.180]   That wouldn't affect my ability to actually do this job.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.300]   It would make my life inconvenient, but it wouldn't affect my ability to do the job.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:37.100]   But at least if I had that paralyzing event, I would, under the terms of a presumptive
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.100]   total disability, regardless of my ability to work and earn income, I would be receiving
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   a disability benefit.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.860]   That could be extremely helpful.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.660]   So I always like it when policies have that in there.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.660]   Is it a must?
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.460]   I don't think it's a must, but I think the chances are so remote.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.060]   I think the insurance companies, it's a cheap benefit to have in there.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.100]   So many of them have that, the presumptive total disability.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:04.220]   That's how you figure out what's in your insurance policies.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.780]   Those features right there, which is probably like drinking from a fire hydrant if you're
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.500]   not familiar with these terms.
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:18.140]   Those features determine how valuable or not valuable your disability insurance policy
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.140]   is.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.820]   If you're working in the United States of America and you are earning wages, you're
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.780]   going to be covered under the Social Security Disability Insurance Program.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:33.900]   I consider that program as worthless as anything because of that definition of disability.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.940]   You qualify as being disabled under Social Security.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:47.860]   You can't be able to do any gainful activity, any substantial gainful activity.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.780]   Not just, "Oh, I can't do any substantially gainful activity for the next couple of months."
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.820]   This has got to be a long-term thing.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.980]   You're not sick.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.500]   You're not fighting cancer.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:02.980]   You've got to have something where you can't do anything for at least 12 months or you're
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.660]   going to die from this thing.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.020]   Then even there, you get into the stacks and the lines.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.620]   Just the rates of application, the rates of approval are tiny.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.100]   The amounts are tiny.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.580]   I consider Social Security Disability Insurance to be completely worthless.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.820]   That doesn't mean there's a problem of all disability insurance.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:29.340]   It's just you've got to actually check and understand what are the benefits of my policy.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:35.620]   I'm going to save taxation for another day.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.620]   Save taxation.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.420]   I'm going to save a discussion of some of the other types of disability policies.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:48.100]   I've been primarily talking here about individual long-term disability income insurance.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.100]   But there are other kinds.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.100]   There are buy-sell policies.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.540]   There are disability overhead expense insurance.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.220]   There's all kinds of interesting wrinkles.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.220]   Maybe I'll do that in a different show.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.260]   Thank you all so much for listening to this disability series.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.700]   I hope that this has been useful to you and helpful to you.
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.700]   I know many of you have been encouraged and motivated to go out and purchase disability
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.020]   insurance and I love hearing that.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.380]   Man, I wish I had an insurance license to rake the commissions in on this.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:21.860]   It's what I always wanted as an insurance agent, sit down in a format like this and
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:29.820]   just talk and give you a chance to learn and educate you and then sell policies.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.260]   Because once you educate your clients, it's so easy to sell a policy.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:40.300]   Unfortunately due to the ridiculous laws that we have in the United States, I surrendered
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.540]   all my licenses.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.540]   So I can't take any commissions.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.460]   But hey, you know what you can do is you can send me money.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:51.780]   So the way you do that is go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.160]   You sign up to support the show there.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   That allows you to put some money from your pocket into my pocket as a way of saying thank
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.460]   you, Joshua, for this valuable content.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.260]   I really appreciate those of you who are doing that more and more all the time and I thank
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.460]   you each and every one of you who's doing that.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:10.620]   The second thing that you can do is if you want to consult with me on a specific topic,
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.260]   I'm available to you to consult with you.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:17.540]   The way you do that, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.340]   That will link you through to information.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.380]   I can consult with you on any topic.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:27.180]   I did a consultation with somebody on their disability insurance program recently and
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.460]   I just went through there.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.460]   They were working with an agent that was selling them a policy.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:31.900]   I went through and explained.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.060]   Here's how this works.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.660]   Here's how you would decide if you wanted this.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.380]   Here's how you would decide if you wanted that.
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.260]   I can't make specific recommendations of companies or things like that that would get too close
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.460]   to the line of selling insurance.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.380]   Since I don't sell insurance, I need to stay away from that line.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.540]   I can educate you and I can tell you if you're getting clear, good advice or not.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:55.380]   If you'd like to sign up for a consulting call with me, I'd be happy to do that.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:00.900]   I think that consulting client was extremely pleased with the results of that call.

[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.480]   (upbeat music)
