[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   I just want to make sure I heard it properly.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.200]   When Kelly called you, was it to be the V.P. on the Trump ticket?
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200]   Was that asked?
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200]   And did you consider it?
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.720]   And why did you say no to that, but then said yes to this?
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:19.480]   About three hours after the shooting in Butler, I got a call from him and he asked me if I
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.960]   was still interested in specifically in the V.P. slot.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.320]   And I said, no, I had no interest in being vice president.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.360]   I grew up in politics and vice president is the worst job in Washington.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360]   You have no budget.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.800]   You have no staff except what your budget actually all comes to the White House.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.880]   If you do something that offends the president, he can literally, you know, he can take away
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   your plane.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.600]   He can take away your staff and he can essentially put you under house arrest.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.560]   And you know, I have very strong views on issues.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.920]   And I felt like if I took that job, I'd be on house arrest probably on day three.
