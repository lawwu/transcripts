[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   Okay, let's talk about hypertrophy, the topic that occupies the minds of so many youth,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.000]   young men, but also a lot of women.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.320]   I think one of the really interesting progressions that's taken place in the last decade or so
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.760]   is that far more men and women are using resistance training in order to evoke hypertrophy, growth
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.520]   of muscles for aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of reasons.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.160]   What are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy?
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.400]   So not to correct you or insult you, but probably a better way to think about that question
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.720]   is really what stimuli do I need to give the muscle to induce hypertrophy?
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.500]   Now there are hormonal factors that are important, there are nutritional factors, but just to
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.240]   stick with the context of training.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.680]   This is really gonna frame a lot of our answers and as you'll see, it's one of the reasons
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.520]   why I call hypertrophy training kind of idiot-proof in terms of programming.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.600]   Now the work is hard, difficult and all that, but the precision needed is a lot less than
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.640]   what we saw in power and strength.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.500]   And so if you note there, like it's very important that you do it in this style, with this intent
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.240]   and within these parameters and if you're outside the parameters, it's not gonna be
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   it.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.080]   So the CV has a very broad range in terms of your actual applications and this is why
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.560]   you have and will continue to see countless styles of training that all work.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.260]   I mean, I know you were mentored earlier in life by one of my favorite people in this
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.000]   entire field, Mike Mencer, like just an absolute character.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.040]   His style was completely different than what you would see in a classic textbook or any
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.560]   number of different influencers or coaches or individuals.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.120]   And if you've ever thought to yourself like, "Why is it all these programs work?"
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.560]   And people love to jump to things like, "Well, it's the steroids."
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.840]   Just get that out of the equation for now.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.760]   Independent of that, that's not even part of the equation, you're still going to see
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   results.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   And the question is like, "Why?"
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   Well, that's because what's driving changes in strength and power are the adaptations
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.920]   of specificity.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.080]   What's driving changes in hypertrophy is much more well-rounded and so you have options
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   to get there.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.640]   Remember, you're training a movement and now you're training a response and a muscle
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   that cause the growth.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.120]   That's very, very different.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.400]   So if we look at like the classic dogma, we have to basically challenge the muscle to
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   need to come back in this case specifically bigger and the nutrients need to be there
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.800]   to support that growth.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.440]   Okay, the nutrients aside perhaps we can come in a few more minutes and talk about that.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.720]   So all we really have to do is going back to our dogma of activation of something on
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   the cell wall.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.000]   We've talked about this earlier.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   That's got to induce that signaling cascade.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   That's got to be strong enough to cause the nucleus to react to it, to go to the ribosomes,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.280]   to initiate this entire cascade of protein synthesis.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   Okay, so that signal has to be one of a couple of things.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.440]   Either it has to be strong enough one time, it has to be frequent enough, or it has to
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.160]   be a combination of these things.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.960]   All right, so I can get there with a lot of frequency and a moderate signal.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.360]   I can get there with very low frequency and a large signal like more akin to what you
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.240]   did with Mike back in the day I'm sure.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.440]   DAN: And still train that way.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   DR.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   JUSTIN MARCHEGIANI: Still train that way.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.880]   DAN: Each muscle group mainly once a week directly and once a week indirectly.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.400]   DR. JUSTIN MARCHEGIANI So all you have to do there to not fail is
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.440]   to make sure the training is hard enough and it's going to work.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   If you choose the frequency path, then you actually have to make sure you're not training
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.920]   too hard to where you can actually maintain the frequency.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.840]   The only wrong combination here is infrequent and low intensity and low volume.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   That's it.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   As long as one of those three variables is high, you're going to get there because the
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.920]   mechanisms that are needed to activate that signaling cascade are wide ranging.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.640]   And this is why when we even see things like blood flow restriction training, right?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.380]   This is when you put like a cuff on your arm or your leg and you block blood flow and you
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.600]   use no load or as low as say 30% of your maximum and you take it to fatigue failure.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.240]   That actually is an equally effective way of inducing hypertrophy despite the fact that
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.880]   you know, you're using 3, 5, 10, maybe most 20 to 30% of your max.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   Why?
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   Because you went through the route of metabolic disturbance, okay?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.480]   Other ways, say a higher load, maybe as heavy as you can for say eight repetitions is going
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.360]   to get through what's called mechanical tension.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.760]   And so there's these different paths that we can get to the same spot.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.680]   Now eventually these things have a saturation point.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.100]   So you don't need all three of these mechanisms.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.820]   The third one of course being muscle damage or breakdown.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.080]   And I know we want to chat a little bit about that, but none of these three are absolutely
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.160]   required.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.000]   You can have multiple of them in a session.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.680]   You don't have to have breakdown at all.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.040]   That's a complete, well really it's a flat out lie that you have to break a muscle down
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   to cause it to grow.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.320]   That's just not needed at all.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.500]   You have to have one of these three things though.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.800]   And so again, this allows you a lot of flexibility, which is why crafting your program, which
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.280]   is best for you, is actually fairly simple when it comes to hypertrophy.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.480]   You just have to make sure you do the work and you want to make sure you have a few standards
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.720]   in place with the exercise choice and some other things that we'll hit in just a second.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.680]   But that's really the fundamental way of getting to it.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.640]   Making sure either that signal is loud enough or frequent enough to give the nuclei a convincing
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.400]   enough reason to spend the resources, because you have to remember two things.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.680]   In order to grow new skeletal muscle, you need amino acids, which are your supply.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.840]   And then you need primarily carbohydrates as the energy source to power that synthesis
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   process.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.400]   You remember basic chemistry, it says if you're going to take two atoms and you're going to
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.800]   pull them apart or put them together, right?
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.160]   That's going to take energy.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.680]   Typically, and most of actually metabolism, when you split a bond, you're going to getâ€”it's
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   called exergonic.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   You're going to get energy from that.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.960]   But when you put them together, that's going to take energy.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.520]   This is why we call that protein synthesis, right?
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.600]   So you have to convince your nucleus that one, invest those resources in energy, primarily
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   carbohydrate.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.640]   But number two and more importantly, invest that supply.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.440]   There's a ton of possible ways to get energy, but there's a very low amount of amino acids
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.760]   available and you need them for many more things than just taking your biceps from 17
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.800]   inches to 18 inches, right?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.680]   It's not going to do that if you're in a position where, again, you can't sustain immune function.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.760]   If red blood cell turnover needs to be higher or any of the other main like tons of things
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.720]   that you need proteins for.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.080]   So you have to be able to say like, "Are you sure?"
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.600]   You really want to spend these resources and build it into muscle because once we do that,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.000]   it's very difficult to go backwards.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.520]   Break them back down and bring the amino acids back into that availability pool, so we can
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.200]   use them for either another function entirely or even another muscle group.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.680]   That's called protein redistribution.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.600]   By the way, when you say, maybe you don't do a lot of upper body work in your training
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.360]   and you're not eating enough protein or a minimal amount and you're doing a lot of lifting
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.480]   in your legs, you'll notice your legs will get larger, but that's actually a lot of times
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.560]   you're pulling the protein from, say your upper body in this case, and redistributing
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.920]   it back down to the quad.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.600]   So that's what you have to get to.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:41.920]   [music]
