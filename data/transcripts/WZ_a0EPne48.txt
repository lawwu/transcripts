[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   Alright, let's move on here. Ricardo says, Do you recommend having multiple email accounts
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.800]   for someone who works at different institutions? Even if the work is similar between institutions?
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.000]   Yes, Ricardo. In general, I'm in favor of multiple email accounts. I want more friction,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.560]   not less. But more importantly, I want context shifting to be minimized. The biggest under
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.840]   emphasized tax we pay when doing professional work is the cognitive drag required by shifting
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.600]   our mental context from one target to another. It's draining, it reduces our ability to think
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.080]   and it burns us out. So when you are sharing multiple institutional communications all
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.920]   happening in one inbox, you're seeing multiple professional contexts existing together and
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.120]   your brain is trying to bounce back and forth between these things. It's terrible for the
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.560]   brain. Terrible for the brain. I have, I think six email addresses right now. And then Jesse
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.640]   has another for our organization. But I personally have six email addresses because I want to
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.760]   keep these things separate. I use separate in Google Chrome, you can have these profiles,
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.160]   browser profiles so that like if you have your password, say for Gmail for one address,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.520]   you can switch to another platform, another profile where you have your address saved
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.120]   for Gmail for a completely different account. And so I have three, three of those and six
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.320]   different email addresses. And you know, I'll tell you what, some people get mad because
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.760]   like, oh, it's longer before I hear back from you because I have to, you have to wait until
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.160]   I'm next at a day or time where I'm checking that address, but it keeps the context shifting
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.400]   minimized. That's critical.
