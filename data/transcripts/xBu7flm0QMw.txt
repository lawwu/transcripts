[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.160]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.280]   episode 198.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   I'm here as always in the Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.160]   joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.840]   Jesse, 198, 200's kind of sneaking up on us.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.160]   - Yeah, two away, two weeks.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.320]   - Yeah, I didn't really think about it.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.660]   For whatever reason, working on the script for today,
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.420]   I was like, wow, we're almost there.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.840]   I mean, I assume it's probably too late
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160]   for us to plan something special.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.200]   We didn't really get our act together on that.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.600]   - South Africa trip?
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   - We may be a little bit late for two weeks from now
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.440]   to be recording South Africa.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.740]   Maybe though we can get you out on the sidewalk
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.920]   in front of the Republic Restaurant here in Tacoma Park
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.440]   with one of those flippy signs.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.360]   - Yeah. - You spin.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.200]   - That's a good idea.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.760]   - Free podcast show, free podcast show.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.120]   We can get a little audience together.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.040]   Can have like six confused parents.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720]   On the way to the playground with their toddlers,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.380]   just standing around looking upset
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.720]   in the background in the HQ.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.140]   That's gonna be our 200th anniversary.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.300]   I'll tell you, here's the best venue in town.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.260]   I've done a lot of stuff in DC.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260]   I would say the best venue in town for something,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880]   if you're gonna do a big live show, is Sixten Eye.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.180]   You know the Sixten Eye Synagogue?
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.020]   - No.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.460]   - So it's at Sixten Eye in DC.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.900]   It's a historic synagogue, but they have this,
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.540]   it's a fantastic performing space.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.820]   And all of these famous music acts have come through
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.940]   and comedy acts have come through.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.540]   This was the old school where they would actually
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.380]   build rooms for the acoustics.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.340]   And so the acoustics in this room,
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.540]   this giant synagogue room, are just perfect.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.700]   And it's a cool looking room
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.340]   and they do a lot of performances there.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.620]   And I got a chance to perform there a couple years ago.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.500]   It was the Minimalist, you know those guys?
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah, they were in town.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.000]   They were doing a tour.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.060]   So they used to do these tours
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.440]   where they do their podcast live in different cities.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.180]   And they came to DC and Joshua got real sick,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.780]   like hospital sick, you know,
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.300]   just like caught something and was not doing well.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.020]   You know, they're huggers.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.860]   That's their thing.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.900]   Like they hug everyone they meet in the audience afterwards.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.700]   So, you know, you get all sorts of god awful bugs, you know?
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.140]   I mean, forget monkey pox,
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.780]   he probably had crocodile pox or something like that.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.060]   So they were down a man and Ryan was like,
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.100]   can you take his place?
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.660]   Like just, you can pretend to be Joshua for an episode.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.300]   And they were doing it at 6 and I.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.500]   So I got out my black t-shirt,
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.900]   'cause if you're gonna do the Minimalist,
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.260]   you have to be wearing a black t-shirt.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.460]   And we had a great show.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.240]   Anyways, I just remember my one night filling in
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.980]   for Joshua Fields Milburn, enjoying the venue.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.140]   - How did it go? - It was good.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.500]   Yeah, they do a good show.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.280]   They have a musical act.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.900]   I mean, they get it down to a science.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.900]   I'll tell you, you wanna grow a show,
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.180]   you wanna grow your audience,
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.340]   you gotta work and those guys work.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.320]   They have done multiple US tours where they do every state.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.460]   Like that's how they grew the podcast.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.300]   At some point, they're like,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.540]   we're just gonna go to every single state
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.380]   and do a performance.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.380]   And they did that like twice.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.780]   And then when they had that documentary that's on Netflix,
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.660]   they toured movie theaters in every single state,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.680]   bringing in their crowds, premiering it.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.540]   And they did that before Netflix bought it.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.220]   That's what built up the energy
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.380]   that led Netflix to bought it.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.460]   So these guys really are Minimalist.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.940]   In a sense that they focus on what's important.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.740]   Like, okay, we wanna grow our audience.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.500]   And they give it their full laser like attention,
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.220]   which actually is a good lesson about minimalism.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.980]   Like this is the idea for my book, "Digital Minimalism."
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.940]   It's not about not doing things.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.820]   It's not about taking away things
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.060]   for the sake of taking things away.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.860]   It's about focusing on a small number of things
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.340]   that really matter.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.020]   Getting the clutter out of the way that gets in your way.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.220]   So actually working that hard
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.180]   is actually pretty Minimalist for them.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660]   All right, well, anyways, we should get into the show.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.460]   Two annoying PSAs I wanna do real quick.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.200]   One, someone pointed out the other day
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.420]   that the reviews of the podcast on iTunes
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.020]   are really out of date.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.740]   I mean, I don't really talk about it much
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.180]   'cause I find that annoying.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.060]   But it's to the point now
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.580]   where someone who discovers our podcast might say,
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.340]   "Why are there no reviews here since February?"
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.740]   So annoying PSA, if you're an iTunes type,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.540]   if you like the show, maybe leave a review
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.100]   so that it's more up to date.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.120]   That is if you like the show.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.980]   If you don't like the show,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.100]   I just got a notice that the review feature
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.740]   on iTunes is broken.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.740]   And if you try to use it,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.420]   you will have a virus on your computer.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.660]   So keep that in mind.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.380]   Other annoying PSA,
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.420]   if you like the show, you listen to it,
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.860]   you'll probably like the YouTube channel,
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.540]   youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.800]   Full episodes, video of full episodes,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.920]   which now increasingly have visual elements
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.300]   from drawing on tablets, et cetera,
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.140]   available on YouTube just a couple of days
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.980]   after it comes out.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.880]   And we also release standalone clips
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.200]   of individual segments from the show as well.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.440]   So check that out,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.260]   youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.920]   All right, let's do a quick writing update.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.640]   As you know, I'm working on a new book,
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.240]   "Slow Productivity."
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   This is the first time that I have been starting a book
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.880]   from scratch during the era of my podcast.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.240]   So I'm trying to do brief updates.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.820]   You get a window into the writer's life.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.520]   Jesse, here's the update from last week.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.800]   Last week I wrote 5,000 words
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.820]   focused on one particular section
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.240]   in one particular chapter.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.460]   I have cut or rewritten at least 2,500 of those words.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.300]   - Really?
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.840]   - Yeah, I've been a cutting machine recently.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.780]   I've been a rewriting machine.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.580]   Here's what's working.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.900]   Here's what I'm finding is going on with this book
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.460]   is I do what I can to come with a reasonable outline
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.300]   for a chapter.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.820]   I think this going to this going to this
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.820]   is gonna make the most sense,
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   but I can't really tell how well that plan's gonna work
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.820]   until I do the actual writing.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.140]   And so then I have to just step back and say,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.980]   is this really my strongest possible swing
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.300]   at what I'm trying to say?
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.620]   The trap I'm trying to avoid
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.080]   is writing for the sake of writing.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.480]   This is a coherent section.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.320]   It makes sense.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.580]   It's written well.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.140]   It's not enough.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.940]   It's gotta be the biggest, clearest,
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.700]   most impactful possible swing
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.440]   against the target I'm trying to hit.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.580]   So I've been doing a lot of that
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.340]   where I write and then I have to go back and say,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.780]   cut this, cut that, tighten this.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.580]   We need to add better examples,
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.980]   putting myself into the shoes of the reader.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.160]   So there has been a lot of cutting.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.380]   I think, Jesse, that actually my New Yorker experience
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.500]   is leading to more cutting than I'm used to
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.620]   because the New Yorker has really built up my muscles
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.620]   for deep dive research.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.220]   So like what the New Yorker demands,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.700]   if you're gonna talk about something even briefly,
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.180]   it has to be the tip of an iceberg.
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.500]   You clearly know everything about this
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.620]   and you're picking and choosing a few choice things
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.060]   and it comes from a place of expertise.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.300]   So there's like a deep research
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.780]   that goes into that type of writing.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.620]   So now every little subsection of the section I'm writing
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.240]   is gonna have this deep research behind it.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.300]   And so I overwrite everything.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.540]   And then I come back and I cut this, cut that.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.660]   Okay, now let me just take out
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.940]   these three choice paragraphs.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.740]   It's turning out sometimes to find the tip of the iceberg,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.220]   you have to build the whole iceberg
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.040]   and see the whole thing
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.660]   before you know what to put under the surface.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.620]   So I think it's actually leading to more cutting,
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.620]   but I'm hoping what it leaves behind is more confident.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.940]   - Yeah, so how does that go?
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.740]   So for instance, on Monday you wrote
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.140]   and then you re-read that on Tuesday
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.220]   and then you cut some of it?
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.940]   I did a lot of writing.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.500]   Sometimes I'll cut right after,
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.820]   sometimes I'll keep going, then I'll go back.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.060]   I mean, this one section is now
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.740]   at a good tight 4,000 words.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.140]   And as of an hour before we started recording,
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.300]   I think, okay, it's the right structure.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.460]   Still needs polishing,
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.180]   but I think I've cut it down to the next things.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.800]   But now I'm stepping back
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.020]   and looking at where it fits
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.900]   into the outline of the chapter
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.300]   and rethinking the outline of the chapter
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.580]   because every time you get a piece
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.060]   of that outline filled in,
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.780]   you have a better understanding of that chapter.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.740]   And I'm looking at it now and thinking,
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.740]   I think I need something else on topic X or topic Y.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.820]   So it's a very live process back and forth.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.700]   You read and you write and you come out of it
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.140]   and you cut and you read and you write,
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.980]   like, good, this is done.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.500]   Then you step back and say,
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.740]   is this chapter working?
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.660]   Is this whole section working?
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.020]   So that's where I am.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.220]   Still enjoying it though.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.900]   - Do you know how many chapters the book is gonna be?
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.460]   - Probably six plus an intro.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.780]   So part one is the kind of motivating the problem
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.900]   and the approach.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.220]   Right now I have that down to three chapters.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.020]   And then part two is the philosophy of slow productivity,
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.580]   which I've talked about on the show.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.580]   Do fewer things, working at a natural pace,
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.340]   obsessing over quality.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.700]   Those are the three principles.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.460]   You put those three principles together
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.260]   and I think we get a much more humane approach to work,
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260]   something that is much more aligned with our wiring,
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.500]   something that's more sustainable,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.140]   something that makes work more meaningful,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.980]   something that avoids a lot of the issues
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.620]   that we have today with work.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.580]   So I'm doing one chapter for each of those principles.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.540]   But look, that 4,000 words,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.020]   that's one of six sections in one chapter.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.300]   Now, some of those sections are much shorter,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.260]   but yeah, so those are kind of beastly chapters right now.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.060]   Anyway, so that's where I am.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.900]   Still writing.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.860]   Going to California this weekend, so I have plane rides.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.940]   - So does that mean more writing?
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.300]   - More writing.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.980]   Time to kill at hotels.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.580]   More writing.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.500]   Going to Northern California, giving a talk,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.420]   going to a wedding.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.260]   It's gonna be good.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.700]   I'm gonna get some good writing done.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.460]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.100]   I'm gonna do something new.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.980]   Why don't we start with a call?
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.580]   We usually start with written questions.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.540]   Let's actually start with a call.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.580]   I saw one I liked from Alex.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.460]   Let's see if we can find that one lurking in there, Jesse.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.340]   - Yep, here we go.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.340]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.380]   My name's Alex.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.540]   I listen to your podcast often.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.100]   I've tried to follow your advice
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.820]   and get all of my important information out of my inbox
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.580]   and into some sort of trusted system, task list, et cetera.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.100]   Here's the problem.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.980]   You do that, you make up a task list,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.220]   but there's more granular information
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.020]   that you need for each task
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.220]   than you're gonna put in a task list.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.940]   And where that granular information lives
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.420]   is in the email trails that gave rise to the task.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.940]   So you're going back to the emails anyway,
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.180]   and you're still living out of the inbox half the time
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.620]   to try to figure out what to do.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.500]   What's your advice on this?
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.820]   Really appreciate your help.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.940]   Love your podcast.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.580]   Thank you.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.220]   - Well, Alex, this is where Trello
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.460]   is gonna do a lot of good for you.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.660]   So there's three reasons why I like using Trello
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.620]   when it comes to organizing obligation.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.420]   I like that I can have different boards for different roles
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.980]   so that you don't have to context switch
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.220]   between different professional and personal roles.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.540]   You can just be looking at obligations
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.500]   that has to do with what you're doing right now
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.820]   during your day.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.300]   Two, I like the categories.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.580]   Categories are everything.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.100]   Things I don't know what to do with,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.580]   things I'm waiting to hear back on,
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.860]   things I'm gonna bring up at the next staff meeting.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.420]   You can have such creative categories.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.100]   It really helps organize this information.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.020]   But the third thing I like about Trello,
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.300]   and this is very relevant for your issue,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.460]   is the cards can hold large amounts of information.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.340]   This is how you get relevant information out of emails
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.660]   and into a more trusted system,
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.580]   is you put them on the virtual back of Trello cards.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.140]   So when you click on a card in Trello,
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.980]   you can flip it over,
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.540]   and on the back of it, you can add notes.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.180]   And I will just copy and paste emails,
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.820]   text of emails out of Gmail,
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.100]   right onto the back of a Trello card.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.460]   And if there's a thread of emails that are relevant,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.380]   paste one, put a few horizontal dashes,
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.660]   divide, paste another,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.140]   few horizontal dashes, divide, paste another.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.220]   You don't have to format it nice, don't waste much time,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.460]   just get it all in there.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.140]   You can attach files to these cards.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.220]   So people are passing back and forth drafts
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.140]   of the report that you're working on,
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.220]   attach it to the card.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.100]   That's where it lives.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.060]   It lives in Trello.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.300]   You can even put checklist.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.460]   So maybe I'm looking at a thread of emails
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.260]   about a visitor coming, let's say to campus,
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.620]   and I'm in charge of their visit,
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.700]   and I've been doing a back and forth with someone about,
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.320]   what do I need to do?
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.620]   What do I have to arrange for this visitor?
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.740]   I might extract out of that exchange a list.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.380]   You can do checklist on the back of cards in Trello,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.220]   one, two, three, four, five,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.620]   where you can actually check things off
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.500]   and see where you are.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.660]   That third benefit of Trello is a huge one,
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.220]   because again, what it allows you to do
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.620]   is that when it comes time to work
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.100]   on a certain role in your life,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.060]   so your role as manager, your role as copywriter, whatever,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.380]   you go to that board,
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.380]   and all you are seeing is information related to that board.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.260]   And you see everything you need to do
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.020]   under the categories to capture where it should live
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.360]   into your current scheme of obligation.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.300]   So the zeitgeist there is really clear
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.500]   and instantly graspable.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.620]   And all the information you need
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.960]   for the various things on this board
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.660]   are attached right to those cards.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.380]   No need to load up email,
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.820]   no need to see completely unrelated requests,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.100]   no need to induce
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.260]   those cognitively devastating context shifts.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.700]   So that's why I'm a big fan of Trello.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.200]   Other tools can do this well.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.580]   I'm not sponsored by Trello,
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.660]   I don't have any skin in the game.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.860]   I met once, I believe,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.300]   the CEO of the company that bought Trello
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.980]   and expressed my admiration,
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.620]   but there's no formal relationship there.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.380]   If you have another tool that does those three things,
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.020]   that's fine.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.180]   I mean, you can simulate this
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.740]   in something as simple as a Google Doc.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.900]   I've seen people who do this,
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.720]   different docs for different roles,
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.820]   different bolded headings for different categories,
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.900]   bullet point tasks below it,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.380]   information just indented
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.240]   and pasted right underneath the corresponding task.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.540]   People certainly do this.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.760]   One group that does this for sure is developers.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.820]   We talked about this in a past episode.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.120]   We were talking about plain text productivity,
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.560]   but we mentioned that the original term life hacking
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.740]   came from this idea,
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.280]   it was Danny Lewin talking about it,
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.300]   that developers would put everything in their life
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.540]   in one big Emacs file,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.140]   just with indentation and numbers.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.420]   Everything going on, everything they had to do,
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.020]   just indent things, have all the information.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.160]   So you can do whatever tool.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.740]   I just think Trello or Trello-like tools make that easy.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.740]   But the key is, Alex, out of your inbox.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.280]   Get the information out of there
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.560]   and into a system that does not force you
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.120]   to have to confront everything else
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.000]   just to work on one particular task.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.060]   All right, let's see here.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.260]   Let's move on to an old fashioned written question.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.600]   This one is from Arvid.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.380]   Arvid says, "How do I find out what skills are rare
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.380]   "and valuable before choosing a master's program?
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.860]   "I am a mechanical engineering student in my bachelor year.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.300]   "I have a hard time deciding which master's program
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.500]   "I am going to attend.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.240]   "I don't have any clear methodology
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.660]   "for finding out what is rare and valuable.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.880]   "What do you recommend?"
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.400]   Well, Arvid, I appreciate this question.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.240]   I used to come to this topic quite a bit
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.060]   early in the podcast, my advice about graduate school.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.320]   We haven't talked about it in a while.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   So you have given me an opportunity to return,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.360]   as long time listeners know,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.580]   to one of my favorite mini-rants,
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.580]   which is graduate school.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.640]   So here's the TLDR form of my advice, Arvid.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.260]   Do not start a master's program until you have to.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.860]   And here's what I mean about it.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.240]   In almost every situation, here's what I mean by have to.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.660]   You are working in a job you like.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.780]   There is a step you wanna take in this career,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.920]   clearly defined, that clearly demands
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.120]   that you have a master's degree to do it.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.800]   So, okay, I'm doing this.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.780]   I wanna jump over to this position.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.160]   This position will require me to have a master's degree.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.840]   And not only that, but it requires the type
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.480]   of master's degree you're gonna go get
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.220]   from the quality or type of program
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.920]   from which you're going to get it.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.340]   So for example, you're in banking.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.560]   You wanna become a managing director.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.180]   It's very clear in banking, after year three or four,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.960]   you have to get your MBA in order to move
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.340]   to the managing director position.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.020]   That is a standard path.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.280]   You know the quality of school you have to go to.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.960]   They mainly go to Harvard or Stanford
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.660]   for these MBAs, sometimes Wharton.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.080]   So that's why I'm getting my MBA,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.280]   because I specifically wanna do this.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.020]   I specifically know for sure I need to get
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.940]   this type of master's degree to do that.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.240]   Or maybe you're in a federal government job.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.840]   This often happens.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.080]   They get the GS whatever.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.720]   And Jesse, you probably know about this better than I do.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.240]   But to get from this level to that level
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.400]   in this particular department,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.040]   you have to have this level of education.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.560]   You say, great, I want that job.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.920]   I need to get that, this level education.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.800]   This master's degree will satisfy it.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.080]   Good, let's go do it.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.920]   That's why you go to graduate school.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.560]   You do not go to graduate school
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.760]   because you think in general,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.920]   having a master's degree will open up more options.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.080]   You don't go because you say
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.320]   that might be an interesting thing to do.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.200]   And maybe vaguely this will let me go
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.540]   into this other career field.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.000]   You have to have specificity.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   This degree from this program will get me this job.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.600]   Without it, I can't get it.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.100]   That's when you go to get a master's program.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.440]   If you're going just because you think
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.340]   it might open up options,
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.280]   let me give you an easier way to accomplish
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.640]   the same thing that that will accomplish.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.960]   A way to accomplish the same thing that will accomplish
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.880]   without you having to waste so much time.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.940]   Just make a sizable philanthropic donation to that school.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.320]   Because that's what you're accomplishing.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.240]   If you say, I'm gonna go do this master's program
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.800]   because I like policy
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.120]   and maybe it'll open up some doors for me.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.400]   The school welcomes your money,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.280]   but you could just cut out the middleman
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.120]   and give them that money
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.640]   without having to waste your evenings for two years.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.020]   All right, so Arvid, get a job that you like.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.640]   Wait until you get to an obstacle
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.240]   where a specific master's degree is clearly the way past it.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.180]   Then think about going back to school.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.600]   All right, I appreciate that.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   Jesse, it was before your time
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.300]   when I used to rant more about master's degrees.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.000]   - A lot of coaches need to get their master's
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.480]   and get head coaching jobs.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.080]   - Yeah, that's a real clear thing.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.920]   Well, how's it work?
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.960]   You would be, what is the path for head coaching
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.800]   of a program?
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.600]   Do you come out of assistant coaching?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.800]   - Most of the time, yeah.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.760]   - Right, and then what do you have to have a degree in
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.440]   for the jump to head?
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.160]   - They're just, a lot of the ones that I've come across
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.880]   are just, you need to have your master's,
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.200]   not necessarily in any specific degree,
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.600]   but just like athletic directors like to see
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.700]   that you have your master's
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.080]   and then that gets you the qualifications
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.400]   to be interviewed and stuff.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.420]   - So there's a lot of things like that.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.920]   I think there's a lot of positions like that
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.980]   where, okay, now you see you need this degree
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.140]   at this point to move on.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.900]   And to me, that's the time that you actually do it.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.980]   All right, we've got another question here.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.900]   This one is from Rick.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.660]   Rick asks, how do you know what is enough
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.260]   for the next step of your career?
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.620]   I'm a PhD student in biomedical sciences,
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.140]   studying cancer biology at a well-known university
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.340]   in the US.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.620]   I would be the first person even in my extended family
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.740]   to get a PhD and I'm also the first woman
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.980]   in my immediate family to go to college.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.460]   I'm not sure if these things factor in,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.940]   but I constantly find myself either in a panic zone
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.500]   or in a comfort zone.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.100]   It's hard for me to identify the growth zone for my career.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.900]   I started my PhD after gaining years of research experience,
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.820]   but I think that was not really necessary
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.300]   now that I'm here and I'm looking at my classmates.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.140]   It's really frustrating.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.480]   How can I better identify what's enough and required?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.700]   I'm clearly passionate.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.500]   That's why I end up doing a lot without realizing it,
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.460]   but this also leads to burnout and frustration.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.180]   Well, first of all, I should apologize.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.420]   It's possible I messed up the name on this question.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.600]   'Cause I'm calling this person Rick,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.740]   but it's also the first woman in her family to go to college.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.820]   Rick is not one of those names that's used both ways,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.660]   is it?
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.140]   - I think we probably messed up the name.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:38.980]   - So, okay.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.420]   So Rick, first of all, I apologize for getting your name
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.980]   wrong, but let's just pretend we're doing that
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.380]   for anonymity reasons.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.100]   Well, second of all, A, congratulations.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.900]   What you're doing is very hard.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.740]   And that was my B,
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.660]   was gonna be what you're doing is very hard.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.500]   And the reason why it's hard,
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.860]   it's not just that it's hard to get a PhD.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.060]   Yes, it is.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.780]   But we often underestimate how much value is extracted
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.460]   from having informal networks of knowledge
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.480]   that help you structure your professional pursuits.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.020]   These go a huge long way to helping people navigate
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.180]   through particular professional paths,
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.060]   friends, family, peers,
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.920]   who have gone through similar things.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.940]   There's information that you'll get through osmosis
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.500]   or information you will get explicitly
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.980]   about how properly to navigate this.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.600]   And it is a huge advantage in moving through career paths.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.020]   So you're trying to do this without those informal
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.900]   structures of knowledge.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.720]   And I think that's exactly what you're hitting up against
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.180]   is you're having to guess,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.360]   well, maybe I should go do more of this.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.240]   Maybe I should do research before PhD.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.720]   Maybe in PhD, I should focus on being really good at this
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.560]   instead of that.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.720]   You're essentially just guessing at what might be important.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.920]   And because you're first generation to do this,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.080]   you're probably leaning towards overworking
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.160]   on some of these things as well.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.040]   So not only are you sometimes spending time on things
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.880]   that aren't that important,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.480]   but you might be spending a lot of time on those things.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.680]   And that's where I think your frustration is coming from.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.040]   So here's what I think you need to do.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   You have to recreate those informal networks of knowledge
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.400]   about your career.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.860]   You're gonna have to go out of your way
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.940]   to get that information in a way that the son
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.500]   of a prominent professor,
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.040]   who's one of three siblings to get their PhD,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.180]   would not have to do.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.600]   So it's not fair, but it's the reality.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.480]   Let's make sure we're doing the best with the reality
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.760]   that you have right here.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.900]   So I would recommend treating your career
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.280]   partially as a PhD student,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.520]   partially like you're a journalist or book author,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.800]   writing a book about how to be a successful PhD student.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.240]   And by that, I mean, you actually have to now go out there
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.060]   and really be doing research about your job.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.520]   It's not as hard as this might make it seem,
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.000]   but you need to be trying to learn from those around you
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   what matters, what doesn't.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.440]   Now, some of this can be observational, right?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.960]   Passive observational.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.660]   Let me look at the senior students in my group.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.880]   Which ones are crushing it?
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.400]   Like which ones are the stars
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.120]   and they're getting the opportunities
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.700]   that they want upon graduation
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.640]   and try to figure out what was key, what are they doing?
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.480]   What's key about it?
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.120]   Is it publication rate?
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.720]   Is it the type of technique they learned?
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.020]   Do differential analysis if possible.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.940]   I did this as a professor.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.560]   I wrote a sort of well-known blog post about this
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.520]   where when I was a new professor,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.080]   I took graduates of the same research group.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.120]   So I tried to control for other variables.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.620]   It was graduates from PhD programs who had the same advisor.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.620]   And then I went to their CVs and I studied
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.540]   which of these went on to quickly get tenure
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.180]   and which ones struggled to get tenure.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.300]   Either it took them a long time
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.500]   or maybe they left academia without getting tenure at all.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.220]   I was like, look, they're starting from the same place.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.940]   They train under the same advisor at the same top school.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.700]   And then I said, let me just analyze these two people
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.940]   or these two groups rather
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.080]   and see what's different between them.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.100]   And in that case, what I discovered is that
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.700]   the cohort who got tenure easily,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.540]   the main thing that differentiated them from the other
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.960]   was not publication count.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.420]   Both groups published a lot of papers.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.520]   It was citations of their five most cited papers.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.540]   So the difference was I discovered was,
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.980]   oh, it's not how much you're publishing.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.700]   It is publishing things that other people cite,
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.580]   which means you have to be up to speed
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.540]   on the actual literature.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.900]   What's actually gathering people's attentions
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.640]   and that's where you need to be working.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.460]   Got to get in the game where people are actually working.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.100]   Now that's just for my field, but whatever.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.220]   This is an example of differential analysis.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.060]   You should be doing something similar within your group.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.780]   Which students in my group are getting good job offers,
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.900]   which aren't, what's the difference?
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.740]   Let me analyze them.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.780]   And the answer might not be what you suspect.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.020]   Like it might have to do with productivity.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.140]   It might have to do with technique.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.960]   Oh, these people mastered a technique
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.900]   that's really hot right now.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.340]   These people are working on an older technique
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.180]   that no one cares about
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.580]   or a new technique that no one didn't pick up steam.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.620]   Whatever, you'll figure out what the difference is.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.220]   Or they write a lot of review papers
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.180]   and these people did it.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.860]   So you might be doing passive observational research
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.020]   to try to figure out what really matters.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.780]   Then you can also do active interrogatory research.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.200]   I am going to talk to people,
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.300]   take out professor or postdoc for coffee,
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.580]   say, look, I'm first generation to do this in my family.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.560]   I just want to learn.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.400]   What have you learned?
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.220]   What's important?
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.060]   What's not?
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:45.900]   What should I focus on?
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.720]   What should I not?
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.520]   Like you're a journalist trying to write
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.380]   the definitive book on how to do well
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.420]   in a PhD program at the school where you are
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.060]   in the program that you are.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.580]   You are recreating these informal structures of information
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.180]   that really does help people navigate through career paths.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.220]   Again, it's why kids are professional athletes
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.660]   are more likely to be professional athletes.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.940]   Yes, there's genetics there,
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.340]   but there's also, it's a really unusual path.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.800]   Like what's required and what it takes.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.100]   And they can learn that from their parents.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.740]   Kids are professional musicians,
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.620]   more likely to be professional musicians.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.260]   Kids of actors, more likely to be professional actors.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.500]   Maybe they have some acting gene,
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.980]   but a big part of it is they can actually learn firsthand
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.000]   how Hollywood works.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.780]   So you see that again and again.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.620]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.780]   You are doing something very hard.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.580]   I want you to get as much information as possible
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.260]   about how that field actually works
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.340]   so that you're not wasting.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.700]   I don't want you to waste any more of your effort.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.200]   I want your effort going towards the things
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.140]   that really matter.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.420]   All right, well, we have a habit tune-up
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.060]   docked in the docket here on seasonality.
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:54.900]   But before we get there,
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.500]   let me do a quick word from the sponsors
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.060]   that make this show possible.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:05.420]   I wanna talk first about Kion Aminos.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.980]   So you probably know that the human body
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.220]   is mostly made of water.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.580]   What you probably don't know is that
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.060]   everything that's in the water is made of water.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.860]   Everything else in your body is 50% amino acids.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.660]   These are the building blocks of life.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.980]   They are essential for your health and fitness.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.700]   So no matter how you like to move
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.660]   or whatever you do to stay fit,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.220]   you have to care about your amino acids.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.980]   Now, people who are really in the fitness know about this.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.220]   When I walk into the HQ,
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.540]   usually the first thing Jesse says to me is,
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.020]   "Hey man, how's your aminos doing today?"
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.860]   - It's true.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.500]   - I don't always have an answer.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.460]   And I'll say, "I'm embarrassed."
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.620]   So this is why Kion Aminos
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.820]   is a fundamental fitness supplement.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.100]   I have been trying these out.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.860]   You drink them, it's in a drink form.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.140]   You can drink them every day for energy, muscle and recovery,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.140]   especially if you're doing some pretty intense exercise.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.780]   I had to take a week off exercise, Jesse,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.900]   because of my cold.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.740]   Got back to it yesterday.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.660]   Feel a lot better.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.340]   Feel--
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.060]   - Crushing the rower?
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.900]   - Oh, the rower.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.180]   Well, let's get to that in a second.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.260]   I have to brag about my rowing heroics.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.860]   All fueled by Kion Aminos.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.740]   Kion Aminos is backed by over 20 years of clinical research,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.140]   has the highest quality ingredients,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.460]   no fillers, no junk,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.900]   undergoes rigorous quality testing,
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.700]   and it does taste amazing.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.740]   I do like the taste of it.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.220]   So if you want to naturally boost energy,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.660]   build lean muscle mass or enhance athletic recovery,
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.780]   you need to get Kion Aminos.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.660]   You can now save 20% on monthly deliveries
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.420]   and 10% on one time purchases.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   To do so, you have to go to getkion.com/cal.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:54.460]   So that's G-E-T-K-I-O-N.com/cal
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.300]   to get Fundamental Supplement for Fitness.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.020]   Kion Aminos.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.620]   Yeah, I should note,
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.900]   as long as we're talking about fitness accomplishments,
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.180]   as Jesse knows,
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.000]   I hit my goal announced on the podcast.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.800]   Of getting under two minutes split times
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.480]   for a 2000 meter row.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.040]   And then I made the mistake
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.360]   of going to the Concept2 website
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.080]   and looking up average times for my age
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.360]   for 2000 meter rows.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.440]   - What is it?
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.160]   - Well, let's just say my sub two minutes split time
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.480]   moved me from the beginner status to novice status.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.320]   - Really?
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.200]   - Yeah, so I'm out.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.080]   But here's the thing, rowers are crazy.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.000]   So the times on Concept2 are from crazy rower types.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.400]   So I was so proud of myself that I realized like,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.200]   oh, that just makes me a novice.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.040]   So now I have a new goal, Jesse,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   that is I wanna get to the split times
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.520]   that makes me intermediate.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.600]   - What is that?
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.800]   - I forgot exactly what it was,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.860]   but it's like 150, 150 something.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.480]   So I did 158 was my split time
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.080]   on my record-breaking novice,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.560]   it's a 2000 meter row.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.720]   And I think 150 something.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.760]   - And what's advanced probably like in the 140s?
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.600]   - In the 40s, yeah.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.880]   That's what I used to do as a kid.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.240]   - How'd you feel after the?
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.560]   - Wasn't too bad.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.520]   Yeah, wasn't too bad.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.480]   I think the weak spots probably not cardiovascular,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.200]   just like leg strength.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.520]   I think that's, honestly, what I need to bring it down
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.760]   is probably just work on the leg strength.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.120]   My lungs held out okay.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.640]   I wasn't, it wasn't running out of air.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.080]   I think I'm just not getting quite enough power
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.160]   out of the legs.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.920]   But I'll keep pounding the Keone Aminos until,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.160]   if I get the intermediate, I'm happy.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.920]   If I can be at the intermediate level for my age group
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.400]   on the Concept2 website,
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.560]   I'll feel like my cardio fitness is in a reasonable place.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.880]   - Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.760]   - Yeah, 'cause those guys are animals.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.360]   And by the way, rowing is completely genetically weird.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.880]   Like the stroke of the boat I was in freshman year
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.080]   was a great 2000 meter rower.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.880]   So he won his category at Crash B's.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.440]   So if you're a rower, you know what this means.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.920]   It's an erging competition,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   National Collegiate Erging Competition.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.960]   And he's about my height, a little shorter, six foot,
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.960]   skinny guy, skinny dude, and just crushes rowing machines.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.800]   - Really?
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.200]   - He eats them up, spits them out.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.120]   It's like that, man.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.280]   There's so many stories about that,
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.360]   where people just walk in, hungover,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.320]   and blast out a 620, 2000 meters.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.520]   There's just some freak of genetic nature.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.960]   Well, I'll tell you this though,
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.200]   and here's a professional transition.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.000]   All of that rowing is gonna make you hungry.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.640]   You're gonna want something good to eat,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.240]   but you don't wanna take in the junk
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.760]   that's gonna get in your way
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.240]   of breaking new records on the rowing machine.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   That is where Magic Spoon enters the scene.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.640]   You've heard me talk about Magic Spoon.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.920]   It is that treat style cereal
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.960]   that we all used to like as kids,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.040]   but without all of the junk.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.880]   Here's the stats.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.840]   Magic Spoon cereal has zero grams of sugar,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.000]   unless technically we're talking about the Honey Nut flavor,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.120]   which might have one gram.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.560]   So, you know, beware.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.920]   13 to 14 grams of protein
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.920]   and only four net grams of carbs in each serving.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   The calories for each serving is only 140.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.560]   That makes this product keto-friendly,
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.040]   gluten-free, grain-free, soy-free, and low carbs.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   What you can do is actually build your own box.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.520]   So, a variety sampler of different flavors.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.680]   Available flavors include
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.560]   cocoa fruity, frosted, peanut butter,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.760]   cookies and cream, maple waffle, blueberry cinnamon,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.320]   plus the newly reformulated Honey Nut flavor,
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.480]   which has now been added,
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.400]   it's been promoted to the permanent collection
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.480]   from special flavor to permanent flavor.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.400]   Honey Nut's good.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.920]   Honey Nut works with cereal.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.560]   It's one of their better flavors.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.680]   So, go to magicspoon.com/cowl
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.760]   to grab a custom bundle of cereal

[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.920]   Thank you, Magic Spoon, for sponsoring this episode.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.320]   All right.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.160]   Let's do some habit tune-ups, Jesse.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.560]   - Sounds good.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.880]   - So, for those who don't know,
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.120]   habit tune-up is a segment in which
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.160]   I take a piece of advice from my advice canon
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.880]   and walk you through it.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.400]   So, today I wanna talk about what I sometimes call
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.320]   multi-scale seasonality.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.600]   So, I've been reading a lot recently
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.760]   about what I sometimes think of as natural productivity.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.040]   What I mean by that is the way as human beings
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.560]   we are wired to work.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.760]   So, clearly, through most of our history,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   before culture could rapidly intercede
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.800]   with what our day-to-day lives were like,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.000]   we had time for our brains and bodies to evolve
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.680]   for whatever it was we had to do to survive day-to-day.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.960]   And I'm really interested in what that is
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.760]   'cause it gives us some, I'm approaching this with care,
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   but it gives us some notion
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.240]   of what our natural inclinations for work actually are.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.960]   So, actually, as we finish recording this, Jesse,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.560]   my research assistant, Caleb's coming over.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.880]   He's bringing a big stack of research
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.560]   he's been doing on my behalf on this topic.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.160]   So, a couple hours from now,
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.880]   I'm about to really increase my knowledge
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.640]   of how did we think about work in the Paleolithic.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.000]   So, one of the things, though, that seems to be clear
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.200]   from the work I've done so far
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.240]   is that our minds are not used to this idea
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:14.120]   of being pegged at all-out work relentlessly
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.440]   day after day, week after week, month after month.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.160]   Our natural sense of productivity
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.680]   is way more rhythmic on different scales.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.080]   There's intense periods and recharge periods.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.440]   There's up and down periods.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.120]   There's a variability to what work means.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.520]   We get frazzled.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.600]   We get this chronic background hum of anxiety
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.880]   when it's every single day, wall to wall,
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.160]   email, Zoom, email, Zoom, email, Zoom,
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.240]   Slack, Slack, Slack, email, email, email,
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.120]   quick break, dinner, go to sleep, repeat.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.640]   Again and again and again.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.120]   We can handle intense situations.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.660]   We're not meant to live in that all of the time.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.480]   So, one of the things I have been recommending,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.960]   one of the things I've been experimenting with
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.880]   is what I call multi-scale seasonality,
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.400]   which is about inducing more breaks
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.480]   into your working life at different scales
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.800]   to give yourself some freedom
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.680]   from the sense of I'm always on.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.880]   Now, at the scale of a year,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.640]   most people will take vacation.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.080]   So, that's good.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   One or two weeks, maybe twice a year,
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.840]   people will take off work and that's good.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.120]   But what I wanna recommend with multi-scale seasonality
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.720]   is that we replicate this at shorter timeframes.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.960]   So, if possible, I would say take one day off
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.020]   every two months or so.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.560]   So, if you're in a job where you build up
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.840]   like a federal government job,
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.560]   where you build up a bunch of personal days
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.880]   and vacation days, use one, once every two months.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.680]   Take that day off and don't work.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.440]   Do something kind of over the top that signals to yourself
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.560]   that this is a self-care relaxation type of day.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.400]   Next, again, if possible in your job,
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.100]   take one half day off every two weeks or so.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.040]   Now, this I would recommend
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.360]   if you're in a knowledge work job,
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.960]   just doing unofficially.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.360]   Let you follow my advice.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.320]   You're on top of things.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.100]   You're organized, you're time-block planning,
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.480]   you're multi-scale planning.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.400]   You get your stuff done.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.360]   You can set things up so that on Friday,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.200]   you're really clocking out of work at 1.30
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.520]   instead of going all the way to five.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.000]   You can figure out how to basically do that.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.880]   If you're working from home,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.520]   you can literally go somewhere else.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.540]   If you're working in an office,
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.640]   you can kind of informally shut down
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.400]   and kind of be relaxing, working something else
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.320]   and then leave the office early,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.000]   a little bit earlier than normal.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.320]   So, you can do this a little bit unofficially.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.560]   That's like a half day where I'm going to see a movie.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.820]   I'm going to catch a day game at the baseball stadium.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.880]   Do that every two weeks or so.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.840]   Look, if you're an organized person,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.160]   this will have zero impact on how much you produce,
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.440]   but it is really good for your psychology.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.680]   It's not that this adds up to a ton of time off,
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.140]   but psychologically, it adds up to regular breaks
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.200]   from what's going on.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.100]   You're never too far away from a half day
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.100]   that you're taking off out of the normal,
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:03.980]   where you'd normally be working.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.320]   You're never more than a month or so away
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.460]   from taking a full day off and doing something else.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.360]   You're never six months away
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.200]   from taking two weeks off for a vacation.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.340]   So, having breaks on multiple scales
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:18.060]   serves a really useful psychological trick,
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.060]   and it gets your brain into a mode of,
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.140]   we worked and we're off,
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.300]   and it can really help short circuit
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.700]   that background hum of anxiety that happens
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.180]   if you feel like you're constantly picked.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.020]   Now, in the big picture,
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.520]   I think multi-scale seasonality
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.780]   can be way more aggressive than that.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.380]   I have a lot of thoughts about that.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.820]   I think work should be way more varied than that.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.500]   We'll get to that.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   The whole chapter of my new book's going to be about that,
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.020]   but for now, this is a simple thing
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.600]   that you can do right away
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.320]   that will make a big difference to your psychology.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.180]   - So, do you practice that?
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.240]   - Yeah, well, I practice more extreme versions,
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.900]   but again, I have a very flexible job.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.940]   I have seasons that are different than other seasons.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.060]   I'm in writing mode for three months now.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.500]   That's a big change.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.420]   Yeah, I do weeks off, not weeks off,
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.220]   days off on a very regular basis.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.680]   I'll do that, protect days way out in advance.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.140]   Makes a big difference.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.420]   - But you still write six days a week?
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.440]   So, I mean, what I'm talking about days off
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.020]   is usually from Georgetown stuff.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.540]   Yeah, writing's on a different type of scale.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.920]   I'm working on a book for the six months,
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.580]   and then the next six months, I'm doing nothing.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.540]   So, like, writing goes back and forth on that scale.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.900]   But I'm coming to it.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.420]   This is the working at a natural pace
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.740]   piece of slow productivity.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.740]   This is what this is starting to get to.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.700]   Is work should not necessarily be,
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.780]   I'm just pegged eight, nine hours a day
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.020]   with a few extra checks after,
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.180]   'cause there's always stuff piled up,
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.260]   always stuff I'm working on.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.420]   Anytime I barely get away, if I am, it's an issue.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.660]   We're not wired for that.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.620]   All right, so I wanna try something,
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.420]   some trepidation, let's try something new here.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.020]   So, Jesse has prepped three calls,
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.660]   each with a quick question.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.220]   I have not heard these calls.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.740]   I don't really know what they're about.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.020]   So, we're gonna call this rapid fire.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.620]   We're gonna do three calls in a row.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.020]   After each call, I'm gonna try to,
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.140]   without having done any prep, give a quick answer.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.260]   So, we're gonna do three calls
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.940]   with three rapid fired answers,
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.620]   and we'll see how that goes.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.900]   - Sounds good, here we go.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.180]   First call from Amy.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.020]   - Hey, Cal, my name's Amy,
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.260]   and I have a quick question
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.340]   about your evening wind down routine,
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.460]   in that I'm curious as to what it is these days.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.380]   Thanks so much.
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.380]   - Well, Amy, I think you need to start drinking heavily
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.380]   at four, and really bring that in for a landing
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.660]   right about 11, as you slip into unconsciousness.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.700]   Now, my evening wind down routine,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.620]   schedule shutdown confirmed.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.080]   You do the shutdown ritual, you close the open loops,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.900]   you look at your plan for the rest of the week,
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.460]   and make sure that you're on track to complete it.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.700]   You check that check box in your time block planner
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.260]   that says the schedule is shut down.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.060]   And then what I do is I try to make a rough plan
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.300]   for the night ahead.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.060]   I think if there's some interesting or productive
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.700]   things I can do during the evening, I enjoy it more.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.860]   Yesterday as an example, I reconfigured my closet.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.300]   I like having something like that to do.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.420]   I'm gonna work on the yard,
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.940]   I'm gonna reconfigure my closet,
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.740]   I'm gonna take the kids to go see this thing,
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.660]   there's a special show we're looking forward to watching,
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.660]   there's something I'm gonna research.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.020]   So having productive, interesting things to do,
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.740]   family oriented, unwork oriented.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.860]   So shut down hard, have a ritual, check the box,
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.020]   and then have a completely new, rough,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.460]   but active plan for the evening.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.940]   And if that fails, again, start drinking at four,
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.580]   coming for a landing at 11.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.900]   - What did you do to your closet?
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.760]   - Oh, this is riveting stuff.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   I had one hanging bar, and I reconfigured it to have two.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.420]   So I could have the shirts up high,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.420]   and the pants down low, and I cleaned it out.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.500]   And man, I had--
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.820]   - Do you purge a lot?
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.020]   - I have recently.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.980]   I just went through a big purge.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.500]   It was a lot of clothes.
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.540]   Yeah, a lot of clothes.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:13.860]   So now I am down to mainly just things I actually wear,
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.460]   and they're like hung up properly in a closet.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.620]   So I like it.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.020]   If you don't have things to do in the evening,
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.220]   you fall back on the screens.
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.060]   - Yeah.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.480]   - And it just feels, yeah.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.680]   Like you're just kind of upset and bored and sad, basically.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.140]   So you gotta have something to do.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.020]   All right, what do we have next?
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.060]   - All right, next call.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.380]   Here we go, from Andy.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:43.060]   - Hey, Cal, Andy here.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.060]   Thank you very much for your wonderful podcast.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.600]   I've been enjoying going deep,
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.420]   and dropping that into every sentence I use.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.900]   So question for you today is quite simple.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.820]   How do you take deep holiday?
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.660]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.340]   - Jesse, I think if I had that accent,
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.520]   we would have three X more listeners.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.440]   - Probably. - Probably.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.800]   I mean, everything would sound so smart.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.040]   People would be like, that's just imminently reasonable.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.400]   - Well, you do have your one accent.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.280]   - I have a fantastic French accent.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.480]   But people don't take advice
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.080]   on productivity from the French.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.800]   It's not what they're known for.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.280]   It's not, how do I crush it?
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.560]   How do I crush it this week?
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.040]   You don't ask a Frenchman,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.680]   how do I crush it?
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   They'd be like, what you crushing?
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.040]   You take the baguette, you get the wine,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.940]   and the work will be the next week.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.160]   Deep holidays.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.400]   Yeah, it's a good question, Andy.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   I used to try to completely get away from work
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.040]   when we'd be on vacation,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.760]   and it would make me unbearable.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.920]   I would get anxious and unhappy and weird.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.560]   And so actually, I add intentional structure
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.000]   to our vacations and they become much better.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.640]   Now, what I wanna stay away from is email.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.000]   I wanna stay away from Slack and calendars
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.360]   and hyperactive hive mind coordination and context shifts.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.640]   But what I do wanna have is some sort of important project,
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.300]   non-urgent but important project
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.920]   that I'm making progress on.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.960]   So typically, it's gonna be a writing project for me.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.440]   I'm either gonna be writing,
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.120]   or I'm gonna be reading or doing research
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.440]   for a writing project.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.160]   I also add some other structure to it.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.200]   Put a little structure to the day.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.280]   Like, when am I gonna exercise?
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.120]   When am I gonna write?
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.960]   Let's have a couple of plans.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.980]   I feel better with structure.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.660]   I think we tell ourselves the myth
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.340]   that what we really want is nothing to do,
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.360]   nothing planned, anything goes,
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.680]   and then we will feel relaxation.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.520]   But our mind doesn't actually like that.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.060]   Our mind likes having things to do.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:51.880]   So the key to a vacation is just to have a fun structure.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.160]   Like, oh, I'm in this cool place,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.640]   and it's really scenic, and I write by the lake.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.480]   And then in the evening, I like do exercise over here.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.760]   We have drinks on the patio.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.240]   That's structure, but it's fun structure.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.080]   So that's what I've learned.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.400]   Holiday is not about avoiding things to do.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.640]   It's about having a structured life that's more fun
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.000]   and relaxing, entertaining than your structured life
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.840]   back home.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.360]   And we do longer holidays now.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.600]   So we're doing two weeks in Vermont.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.720]   We'll have to figure out what to do with the show, Jesse.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.680]   I'll have to record.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.920]   Maybe I'll record from the, we're staying in the mountains.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.960]   I'm just gonna be riding, right?
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   We're living by the woods with some hiking trails.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.960]   I can walk and do deep walks.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.440]   Maybe I'll bring up some recording equipment
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.280]   to the mountains.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.100]   - Nice.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:37.200]   - Yeah, do some deep questions on location.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.620]   I mean, ultimately my vision would be
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.800]   to spend the entire summer up north.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.880]   - I mean, the weather's perfect.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.720]   - Yeah, we're doing a couple,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.360]   we do a couple of weeks at a time right now,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.880]   but that's the plan.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.720]   - Yeah.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.320]   - The Deep Work Cottage, somewhere up there.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.320]   So we'll see.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.760]   All right, we got one more, rapid fire.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.040]   What do we got?
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.120]   - Here we go.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.040]   It's about books.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.000]   - Hi Cal, my name is Brittany.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.680]   I was wondering, how do you organize your books at home?
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.120]   What categories or subcategories do you use?
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.940]   Thank you.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.680]   - Well, I don't organize them
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.440]   in any sort of logical fashion.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.360]   I mean, a lot of my books,
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.840]   a lot of my personal library books
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.120]   are actually here in the HQ.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.080]   I moved them here when we converted the study
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.520]   into a classroom during that year of COVID
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.760]   when the schools were closed and we were homeschooling.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.200]   So we moved them all to the,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.400]   I moved them all to the HQ.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.160]   So my personal library is actually here
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.000]   and I don't organize them.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.460]   And the only organization you'll see
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.000]   if you look on those shelves is I,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.040]   I have a bunch of copies of my books,
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.840]   like from different languages and this and that.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.440]   I mean, for whatever reason,
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.220]   the stuff I write about does well overseas.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.820]   We've sold rights to, now it's 40 different countries.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.660]   It's crazy.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.520]   There are versions of my books
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.660]   in places that would surprise you.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:00.200]   You can get a Mongolian version of "Deep Work."
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.440]   That is true.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.400]   Whatever, we're all over the place.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.120]   So I put those all together on a shelf
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.440]   'cause I don't know what else to do with them.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.960]   But then otherwise, I mainly don't categorize books.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.120]   Occasionally I'll put together a cluster of books
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.960]   about the same theme if I'm writing something on it.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.120]   So there's like, there's a cluster.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.600]   If you go look at it, my shelf right in the other room,
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.420]   it's like a cluster of books on solitude
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.840]   from digital minimalism research days.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.460]   I think I've clustered my techno criticism books together
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.300]   on that shelf as well,
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.700]   but I don't really think it through too much.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.460]   Anyways, those will move back though.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.180]   We're having the bookcases built.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.820]   We're having bookcases built in the study
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.900]   now that my kids are at normal school again.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.620]   And so all the books will move back from the HQ
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.080]   to my study at home pretty soon.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.460]   And I probably am not gonna organize them that much.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.320]   I use them so much.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.720]   I just kind of know what I have
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.380]   and I get used to where to find them.
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.780]   And so I should do that.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.140]   Though I know people who go the other way, like Dewey Decimal.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.860]   I know people that go straight up library
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:02.700]   with their home libraries.
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:06.500]   Like it is organized by Dewey Decimal systems
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.020]   and they have the card thing sticking out of the bookshelf,
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.180]   you know, where you can see like what numbers are passed here
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.060]   where you can actually like literally go and look books up.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.200]   But yeah, I'm not there.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.100]   I'm not there yet.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.420]   Jesse, we're gonna have to re renovate this whole thing.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.020]   I mean, A, it's kind of a mess,
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.980]   but B, when all the books go,
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.800]   we're really, we're gonna have empty bookcases.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.760]   The spare office is kind of like a garbage dump
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.900]   slash storage room.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:32.740]   - Yeah.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.980]   - I think we got, we have some summer projects ahead of us.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:35.860]   We're gonna make this place look-
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.340]   - Probably gotta get a cleaning lady.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.640]   - We gotta get a cleaning person.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.260]   See how patriarchal and crude you are cleaning lady.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.420]   I'm not gonna guess the gender of who's gonna-
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.260]   - True.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.080]   - Who's gonna clean it.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.680]   So, no, I wanna make this place cool.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.540]   It's just time and laziness.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.880]   But it would be cool if we had, I don't know,
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.860]   some nice chairs to sit in,
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.660]   hang some artwork on the wall.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.480]   - Yeah.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.320]   - It's gonna look good.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.340]   All right, so I have a news reaction I wanna get to
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.220]   that's actually one of the kind of more heartening things
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.900]   I've seen about social media in a long time.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.500]   Before we do, let me just briefly mention
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.540]   one other sponsor that makes this show possible
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.620]   and that is Zock Dock.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.800]   It is difficult to find quality doctors
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   who are nearby, taking patients, and accept your insurance.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.240]   We all go through this.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.400]   Oh, I need a dentist.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.640]   I need a primary care doctor.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.840]   I had one, but they left.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.240]   And where do you start actually finding someone?
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.920]   What most people do is just ask a friend,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.800]   who do you use?
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.920]   You're like, I guess that's who I'll try to do.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.880]   Zock Dock gives you a much better option.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.300]   It allows you to search for doctors in your area
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.180]   of the type you're looking for
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.860]   that take your insurance and are taking clients.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.660]   And you can see reviews from actual patients right there
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.760]   to see if they're any good.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.700]   The app is free.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.580]   The doctors are patient reviewed
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.300]   and it lets you know right away,
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.040]   great, here are my good options of who to sign up with.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.840]   Then once you do,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.260]   Zock Dock has other tools to help you
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.120]   even make those appointments.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.820]   You can choose a time slot
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.220]   and whether or not you want to see the doctor in person.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.400]   I use Zock Dock with my dentist and we do the paperwork.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.840]   You have to fill out those forms
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.020]   and click the little things
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.120]   about what conditions you have or don't have.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.400]   You can do that all online.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.620]   I do it all through Zock Dock.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.420]   It sends me the reminders about appointments.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:34.940]   So it really takes you from who should I see
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.500]   to setting up and scheduling that appointment
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.700]   and getting them all the information.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:42.440]   Really does make healthcare much more convenient.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.820]   So every month, millions of people use Zock Dock
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.000]   and I am one of them.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.980]   In the chaotic world of healthcare,
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.200]   let Zock Dock be your trusted guide
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   to find a quality doctor
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.460]   in a way that is surprisingly pain free.
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:59.840]   Go to zockdock.com/deep
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.340]   and download the Zock Dock app for free.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.740]   Then start your search for a top rated doctor today,
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.100]   many of which will be available within just 24 hours.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:13.100]   So that's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep,
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.340]   zockdock.com/deep.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.620]   If you say it five times fast,
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.560]   I'll give you another 10% off.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.780]   All right, I made that part up
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.140]   about saying it five times fast.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.080]   I just enjoy saying zockdock.com.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:31.420]   All right, I wanna do a news reaction here.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.500]   Brief, it's an article that a Canadian listener
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.920]   of the show sent me.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.840]   And I thought it had something positive in it
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:44.280]   about what we can do and what we are doing
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.420]   about some of the travails of social media and our culture.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:50.800]   So here's the article right here.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.720]   It's written by Sira Agrell,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.920]   who is a politician in Toronto.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.400]   And the title of this article is,
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.580]   Sira Agrell explains why she's embracing tech
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.520]   but not Twitter in her run for public office.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.000]   So there's a couple of things I wanted to point out.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.440]   And for those who are listening,
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.320]   the YouTube version of this segment
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.740]   actually will show you the article as I go through it.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.180]   All right, so a couple of things I wanna point out.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.140]   Here's where the first big point is of the article.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.660]   She says, "Last week I announced
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.580]   that I'm running for Toronto City Council,
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.660]   the Parkdale High Park."
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.520]   So this is someone who is running for city council
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.400]   in a major city.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   And this was the big part of the announcement.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.500]   And I'm quoting from the article here.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.560]   "But as a candidate and a councillor,"
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.000]   so if elected,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.920]   "I will not be using Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.820]   I deactivated my accounts this morning."
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.920]   This is something that is very rare to see.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.440]   "A political candidate announcing
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.460]   I will not use social media during my campaign.
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.240]   I will not use social media once I'm elected."
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.080]   All right, so Sira gives two main reasons
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.920]   why she dislikes these services.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.480]   Let me just briefly summarize both.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.640]   Number one, and I'm quoting here,
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.080]   "It is well-documented that social media
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.080]   has subjected people to intense vitriol and abuse
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.600]   with the highest levels of harassment
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.200]   and threats directed towards women, LGBTQ2+,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.400]   those who aren't white, and people
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.720]   at all the intersections of these identities."
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.960]   All right, so vitriol and abuse.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.000]   Number two, and again, I'm quoting,
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.760]   "These platforms contribute to much wider harm,
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.840]   including radicalization, polarization,
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.800]   deteriorating mental health,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.160]   the undermining of democratic beliefs and institutions."
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.720]   All right, so those are two clear issues
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.680]   we've talked about before.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.120]   These are harassment machines,
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.360]   and they are causing all these negative
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.760]   psychological impacts even beyond harassment.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.360]   All right, so what do we have so far?
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.040]   Politicians saying, "I'm not gonna use social media,"
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.240]   and giving two well-known but very strong reasons
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.240]   for why not.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.120]   All right, now we get to the part that gave me hope.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.280]   I think this is very interesting.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   She says, "This does not mean I'm not using technology."
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.720]   She goes on to talk about all the ways
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.960]   she will be using technology to connect with people.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.640]   So they built out this fancy website,
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.040]   and I'm quoting here, "That will make it easy
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.600]   for people to share information with their friends
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.100]   and neighbors on whatever platform they like,
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.920]   and I hope you will share this article too.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.520]   I'll be engaging directly both online and off
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.680]   through the site, email, text, newsletter, virtual calls,
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.640]   face-to-face interactions, and events
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.000]   where we can actually talk to each other
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.280]   and not just tweet at each other."
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:56.160]   This is the thing that I like.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.360]   Sierra Agrell is making the observation that is true,
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.980]   but that is often missed in media discussions
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.720]   about social media and its ills,
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.960]   that social media does not equal the internet.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.300]   To say, "I'm not gonna use social media,"
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.620]   is not the same as saying, "I am not going to use
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.300]   the modern internet to connect with people,
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.740]   to hear from my constituents,
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.160]   to hear what their issues are, to know what's going on."
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.660]   She is saying these tools are not the only way to do that,
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.580]   and in fact, they're a pretty bad way to do that.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:33.060]   "I have all of these other existing tools,
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.240]   my website, email, text, newsletter, virtual calls,
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.980]   face-to-face interactions, and events.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.620]   This, I think, is one of the most important moves
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.040]   we can make to get around some of the ills of social media,
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.420]   and that is to move away from the platforms.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.100]   But to not just move away from the platforms,
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.140]   but to declare with confidence
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.400]   and embrace with confidence digital alternatives.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.580]   The internet was around before social media.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.560]   The internet will be around after social media.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.140]   There's plenty of innovation out there.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.020]   There's plenty of novel tools out there
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.340]   where the internet can help you,
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.580]   the democratic process and connection."
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.220]   So I like this.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.640]   You can walk away from social media
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.260]   without walking away from technology.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:17.980]   Searock concludes by saying, "I wanna use technology,
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.660]   but in a way that builds connections
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.620]   and allows people to understand
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.740]   what I'm trying to do and why."
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.900]   All right, so there we go.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.960]   There is some positive vision
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.660]   of our future with social media.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.680]   We can embrace technology
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.640]   without having to be clicking on those stupid icons
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.160]   and doing those little 240-character threads and emojis,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.120]   grown adults using emojis.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.800]   This politician has it right,
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.260]   and I hope other people follow suit.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:51.000]   That was a good article.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.400]   I should mention, if you wanna send me things,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.420]   interesting@calnewport.com,
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.400]   that's where I got this particular article.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.840]   I do like the links that people send me.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.120]   If you have thoughts about the show,
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.040]   send those to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.480]   He actually reads them.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.320]   Am I right?
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.080]   Do we get comments?
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.920]   - Yeah, we do.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.740]   - Yeah.
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.580]   - Some good ones.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.420]   - All right, well, I think we have time
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.500]   for one last question.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.040]   This one comes from, I'm gonna use the name Brian.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:16.880]   This is not the real name.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.060]   This was actually emailed
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:22.040]   instead of submitted to our normal question submission form.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.000]   So I'm hiding some details here
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.340]   since I'm using it publicly.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.180]   All right, here's the question.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:32.480]   I'm 38 and working abroad as a diplomat.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.980]   As surprising as it sounds,
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.040]   I don't like my job for various reasons,
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.640]   financial security issues, professional capital.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.880]   I built up throughout the past 15 years.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.240]   I don't have the intention of changing my career.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.720]   Okay, because of financial security, professional capital,
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.800]   though he doesn't like the job,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.680]   he has no intention of changing his career.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.040]   Besides my work, I study philosophy,
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.520]   which is my true passion.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.040]   Therefore, I almost have two careers to run.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.200]   The problem is my girlfriend is turning 35
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.400]   and feels the urge to have a baby.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.880]   I love her and do not wanna break with her,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.380]   but I am now at a crossroads.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.080]   As I see it, building a family would mean
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.280]   getting rid of my passion and finding a job back home
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.240]   to live with my girlfriend.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.880]   Hence my question, do you have views on this?
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.000]   How to conciliate, well, I think he means
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.200]   how to figure out the tensions between deep life,
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.600]   family life and a demanding career.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.720]   Do you have reading recommendations
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.080]   to help me solve this dilemma?
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.200]   The dilemma of being signal and enjoying the deep life
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.480]   and building up a family with the risk of being overwhelmed
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.560]   and losing any hope for personal and professional development.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.400]   Well, Brian, there's a few things in your question
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.760]   that catches my attention.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   You're talking about not liking your job,
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.840]   but having no intention of changing it.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.480]   You're using the term true passion to describe philosophy
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.720]   and this idea that you share that starting a family
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:03.640]   will mean that you have no hope
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.020]   for any personal and professional development.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.460]   So all of those things that catch my attention,
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.020]   to me that all adds up to the conclusion
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.320]   that you're lost my brother, you're lost.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:19.240]   I think what's happening now is that you are just being
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.040]   batted around by concerns and thoughts and fears
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.360]   and emotions in the moment.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.080]   There's no systematic attempt here
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.980]   to understand what's going on.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:31.000]   And I'm gonna say at 38 now is the time to figure this out.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.440]   And the way to figure this out
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.840]   is to step back for a second.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.860]   All right, reset time.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.800]   Let's step back for a second and figure out
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.920]   what we are trying to do here.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.480]   Because again, this is you're all over the place.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.740]   This is fear and randomness talking.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:48.300]   But I'm gonna recommend that you do,
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.120]   which I often recommend to these questions
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.880]   is to do some serious lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.380]   What do you want your life to look like
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   five, 10, 15 years from now?
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.680]   All aspects of the life, where you lived,
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.640]   you have a family, what's your day like?
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.280]   What type of stuff are you doing?
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.040]   Are you among the pine trees reading Seneca?
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.680]   Are you in the city jumping to the art premiere?
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.480]   Are you throwing the ball with the kid?
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.580]   Like really have some of the friends
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.720]   coming over with the cafe lights.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.040]   Like have this clear image of what the day feels like,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.160]   where you are, what the rhythm of the day is.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.840]   You have to figure out what resonates.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.240]   And then you have to work backwards from that
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.400]   to figure out how do I build towards that
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.880]   with my career, with my family life outside of my career,
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.400]   with my hobbies and interests, with my health, whatever.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.060]   All the buckets, all the deep life buckets.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.800]   How do I build towards that vision?
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.640]   That's the exercise you need to do.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.800]   You need to be building towards a vision you believe in,
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.080]   not just reacting to fears about various things,
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.980]   which may or may not be valid.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.240]   Now, here's something I want you to keep in mind.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   As you do this, as you work backwards
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.140]   from the vision that really resonates,
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:04.080]   it might not be obvious what is the way to get there.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.520]   It might not be, oh, clearly I leave the diplomatic corps
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.960]   and take up this job and that will get me there.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.440]   It might be kind of complicated,
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.800]   especially you're figuring out intellectual pursuits
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.920]   like philosophy, the career capital you actually have.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   Be willing and comfortable with the fact
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.160]   that you might get the lifestyle fixed down first
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.320]   before you're able to figure out
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.240]   the reasonable path that gets you there.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.520]   And you might actually have to go out and do some research.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.820]   You might have to go out there and find different people
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.320]   and expose yourself to different things
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.400]   that people have done.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.960]   It might take you a year or more to really figure out
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.560]   what is that reasonable path?
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.520]   What is that reasonable path that preserves
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.960]   my career capital but gets me over
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.440]   to these other parts of my lifestyle?
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.040]   You can't always force it.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.440]   I've been going through a little bit of this myself.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.560]   I've been trying to figure out recently
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.340]   in my current lifestyle image,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.760]   I would say the role of writing
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.360]   versus other type of academic
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.880]   and especially academic administrative work.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.240]   That's not properly in sync for me right now,
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.520]   but I'm also comfortable with the fact that it's tricky
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.080]   to figure out how to move forward to fix that.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.900]   And I'm taking my time with that.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.380]   I'm trying to understand different options
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.240]   and different types of reconfigurations
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.040]   of my academic career that are reasonable, that makes sense,
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.400]   that leverage existing capital
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.040]   and set me up for interesting things in the future.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.640]   I'm talking to people, I'm having conversations.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.120]   I've learned a lot, but it's an example
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.200]   where I have a clear lifestyle image fixed,
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.500]   but I'm still doing the work of figuring out
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.400]   how exactly to get there.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.480]   That might be where you're gonna be
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.080]   because you have a complicated setup.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.280]   That's okay.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.640]   Fix what resonates and then begin the work
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.040]   of figuring out what type of alterations
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.520]   to your career can get you there.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.820]   You're gonna get a lot of the benefit
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.960]   just by having the vision
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.760]   and know you're making progress towards it,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.400]   even if it takes you a while to actually get there.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.520]   All right, so it might not be obvious what to do.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.640]   Also be ready to test these assumptions.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.080]   You long-time listeners know true passion
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.400]   is not something I believe in.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.520]   As you might suspect, this idea that having a family
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.080]   means you lose any hope for personal
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.280]   and professional development is nonsense.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.940]   You're not gonna be the first person in history to do that,
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.440]   and it can be deep and fulfilling in its own ways.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.480]   And the idea that you have no intention
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.620]   of changing your job, again,
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.120]   I would take my foot off the gas on these absolutes.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.940]   Let's figure out the image of the lifestyle
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.360]   that deeply resonates and then start the long work
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.400]   of figuring out how to get there,
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.360]   being willing to test assumptions along the way.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.780]   I think you're lost right now, but the thread can be found.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.800]   Deep life is possible for you,
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.100]   and it might be not at all what you might imagine
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.360]   once you actually start systematically trying to build it.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.460]   All right, Brian, so thanks for that question.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.840]   Thanks to everyone else who sent their questions.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.960]   Go to calnewport.com/podcast.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.040]   I haven't told you this in a while,
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.720]   but calnewport.com/podcast is where the instructions are
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.640]   on how you can do calls
