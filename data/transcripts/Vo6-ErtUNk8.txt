[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   On Wednesday we addressed Santa Claus. On the table today, gift giving. Here's the
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.600]   email. Hi Pastor John, my name is Kaitlin. My family and I love listening to all of your
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.360]   sermons and appreciate the way you proclaim Christ's name. Thank you. My question is this.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.920]   We seek to celebrate the true meaning of Christmas and to not make it so much about the gifts.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   I have two questions for you. Number one, is gift giving biblical? And number two,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   is there a better way to do it? The short answer is yes. Gift giving is biblical and yes,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   there is probably a better way to do it. Since nothing we do is perfect, then there's always a
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.920]   better way to do it. It's good. It's good to ask what aspects of our giving and getting,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.120]   our giving patterns, are merely cultural and what are shaped by Christ to magnify Christ.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.280]   So what I thought might be helpful is to just develop a short theology of gift giving at
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.200]   Christmas by weaving together some of the biblical passages. Three steps from God's
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.480]   giving to us, to our giving to Christ, to our giving to each other, and to those in need.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.840]   So I think it will be helpful just to step back and get the biblical perspective on these three
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.760]   things. Then we'll be able to articulate why are we doing this? Why are we sharing gifts from a
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.960]   pretty deep biblical vision? So step number one, here's the way Christmas is described in the most
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.320]   famous verse, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.880]   should not perish but have eternal life." John 3:16. Paul puts it like this in 2 Corinthians 8-9,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.720]   "You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake,"
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.520]   this is referring now to Christmas, "for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.040]   might become rich." In other words, a huge gift comes to you by his poverty. The meaning of
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:37.160]   Christ's stooping to become man was to raise up, raise up to glory his family. Amazing.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   Then the simple, short, spectacular exaltation of 2 Corinthians 9-15, "Thanks be to God for
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   his inexpressible gift." So the very essence of Christmas includes divine overflow of generosity,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:08.600]   kindness, grace, giving, doing for us, giving to us what we could never do for ourselves or get
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:19.080]   on our own. And the ultimate gift is God. God gives God. Like it says in 1 Peter 3-18, "Christ
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.160]   suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   so that we might have God as our supreme, all-satisfying gift or treasure." So at the
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.560]   heart of Christmas is God giving God for the enjoyment of his people whom he saves by giving
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.680]   his Son to suffer. That's breathtaking. That is the heart of Christmas. Now here's step two.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.880]   Our responding by giving to Christ. Now I know this is dangerous. I feel this more keenly than
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.160]   everything, because I've written whole chapters on why you shouldn't give to God, he's the giver.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.640]   But it's biblical. It's dangerous in one sense to speak of giving to Christ, because our giving to
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:19.240]   Christ dare not be seen as a paying him back, as if the transaction were done because he needs to
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:28.440]   get our services. Mark 10:45 is such a warning. "For the Son of Man came not to be served,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.720]   but to serve and to give." He didn't come to get our service. He came to give his life as a ransom
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:47.240]   for many. He did not come to find a labor force to supply his need. He came as the servant and the
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.280]   giver. Nevertheless, the Bible pictures people giving to Christ. So here's the picture in Luke
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.400]   7. Remember the story where Jesus comes to visit Simon, and a woman comes in and starts washing
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.520]   his feet with her tears, and Simon gets bent out of shape, and Jesus says, "Simon, do you see this
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.280]   woman? I entered your house. You gave me, gave me no water for my feet. She has wet my feet with
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came, she has not
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.720]   ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil. You didn't give me any anointing,
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.240]   but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:49.720]   are forgiven. She loved much, but he who is forgiven little loves little." This is a giving
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:58.360]   that is not a purchasing anything. It's not trading for anything. It was overflow of affection and
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.680]   thankfulness for her forgiveness. Same thing in John 12 where Mary took a pound of expensive
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.880]   ointment, it says, made of pure nard, and just poured it out on the feet of Jesus, wiped his feet
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.920]   with her hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume, John 12 3. And Judas
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:30.600]   was ticked about this because he was a thief, but Jesus defended her and said it was like an
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:40.440]   affectionate anointing in advance for his burial. And of course, this giving to Jesus is connected
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   with Christmas by the wise men. Going into the house, these wise men who came from the east
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.160]   saw the child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then opening their
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:05.080]   treasures, they offered him gifts—gold, frankincense, myrrh, Matthew 2 11. So part of worship
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:16.440]   is finding ways to show how much we admire and reverence and trust and value Jesus, and part of
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.600]   that is making sacrifices—that is, going without things, valuable things, not because he needs them,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:32.600]   but because he owns them, and we can be happy without them if we have him.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.480]   Now here's the third and final step in our little mini-theology of gift-giving at Christmas.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:48.120]   So number one, the giving of God to us. Number two, our joyful readiness to show affection
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:56.200]   in giving to him. Those two things overflow in number three, giving to others. And one of my
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:03.560]   favorite expressions of this dynamic, the way this works in the Christian heart, is 2 Corinthians 8
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:10.520]   verse 2. "In a severe test of affliction," so imagine yourself at Christmas time in some kind of
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   trouble and distress, and a lot of people are, "in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:28.760]   and their extreme poverty have overflowed." So what overflowed? Abundance of joy in extreme poverty
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:38.040]   overflowed in a wealth of generosity—that's giving—on their part. And Hebrews 13 16 says,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:45.720]   "Don't neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices," that's worship,
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:55.400]   "are pleasing to God." So even our giving to others is viewed as a sacrifice, a worship to God.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:02.120]   So here's the sum of the matter that I think all of our gift-giving should be seen in the light of.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   Seek to form a mindset about giving at Christmas that helps the children and helps the adults,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:19.800]   number one, to rejoice in God as the great and first giver of the greatest gift; number two,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:27.960]   the mindset that offers back to Christ the gift of trust and hope and admiration and
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   joy and affection; and then finally, the mindset that overflows with joy in giving to others. Not
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:46.360]   primarily the mindset of getting, but the mindset of joyful overflow of giving.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.880]   - Amen. Those are important mindsets for this season, as we, from overflowing joy,
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.840]   give, and in giving, double our joy as we share our joy with others. Thank you,
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.440]   Pastor John. So good. Caitlin, thank you for the question. I'm looking forward to the next
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.080]   question. I love this. On Monday, we return with a question about Colossians 1.20. That's my
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:13.000]   favorite chapter of the Bible, but it's not one without conundrums. In fact, how can Paul say
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.560]   that Christ reconciles all things to himself in chapter 1, verse 20? Does that apply to angels
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:26.360]   and human souls that are not redeemed? How is it that Christ reconciled all of his creation to
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.400]   himself? It's a great question and one that has perplexed theologians for a long, long time.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.600]   Well, thanks for listening to the podcast. We have entered a really important milestone in
