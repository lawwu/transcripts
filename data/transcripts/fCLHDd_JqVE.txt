[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Embedded into the Christmas story and in the birth narrative of Jesus into this world
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   is a dark story of loss and of tragedy, of tears and of pain.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Matthew 2.16 has been traditionally called "The Massacre of the Innocents."
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   There we're told about the killing of all boys two years old and younger in the region of Bethlehem.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   The event is deeply unsettling, but it's also part of the historical record of the birth of Christ.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Or is it?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Did this actually happen historically, or was this massacre of the innocents a story invented by the early Christians?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And if the event is historically real, if such a public slaughter really happened,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   why are there no other historical records to corroborate the event?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   For answers, we welcome special guest Dr. Paul Meyer, a widely respected historian,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   in what will be a little longer of an episode than usual.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Until his retirement, Dr. Meyer served as the Russell H. Seabert Professor of Ancient History at Western Michigan University.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And he is the author of many fictional books and many non-fictional books, including "In the Fullness of Time,"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   "A Historian Looks at Christmas, Easter, and the Early Church,"
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   as well as several books for children, including "The Very First Christmas."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Dr. Meyer, thanks for joining us. I want to ask you if Matthew 2:16 really happened in history.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   There's a question mark on this event, of course.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But before we go there, who is this figure we know of in the Christmas story, known as Herod the Great?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Well, Tony, you may be surprised to hear this, but believe it or not,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   if you're ever asked which is the one figure from the ancient world on whom we have more primary evidence
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   from original sources than anyone else in the world,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   the answer is not Jesus or St. Paul or Caesar Augustus or Julius Caesar, none of those.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Alexander the Great, no, no. It's Herod the Great, believe it or not.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Why? Because Josephus gives us two whole book scrolls on the life of Herod the Great.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And that's more primary material than anyone else. And I don't think Herod deserved it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He was a very remarkably successful politician, keeping the peace between Rome,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   which had conquered Judea ever since 63 B.C., and he acted really simply as a Roman governor overseas.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   He was known as a client king, meaning very often when the Romans conquered a province,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   they didn't want to send a governor out. There was a local king doing a good enough job.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And so, yes, he may be called king, but he was definitely deferent to Rome as per his whole administration.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He was in charge from, well, 40 B.C. he was awarded the title king.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   He didn't actually take control of the land until, with Roman help,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   he drove some adversaries out of Jerusalem and really from about 37 B.C. on,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   he's in charge until his death in 4 B.C.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   He was remarkably successful in a lot of ways.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He deserves the title Herod the Great if we talk about his accomplishments through much of his life.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He was the one, of course, who rebuilt the great temple in Jerusalem.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He was the one who single-handedly created a city of Caesarea,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   where there was no good port in the Holy Land here.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He creates one by sinking some ship hulls and then using it as a base to build a great breakwater
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   in an otherwise rectilinear sea coast.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So, and he built Caesarea in 12 years and he built other cities like that, too.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   In Jerusalem, he facelifted the entire city.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   In addition to building a gorgeous palace for himself, he had a hippodrome, a stadium,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and theaters and this kind of thing. He was kind of a Hellenistic monarch.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And he also built seven great fortresses across the land,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   strong points at which he could defend his administration.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   One of them, of course, most famous was Masada, down along the southwest corner of the Dead Sea.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Everything he touched diplomatically seemed to turn to gold.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   He kept peace both with Jerusalem and Rome, and so in that sense he was very successful.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah, politically successful. But there's another side to Herod.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Explain the paranoid side of Herod that begins to emerge later on in his life.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Well, basically, basically, he was responsible for many of the problems back home.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   His home was a can of worms, simply because he married ten wives,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   and each of those produced princes for him,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and each of those male princes was scheming to succeed as number one,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and there could only be one number one.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And so if there weren't two or three collateral plots taking place before they had orange juice in the morning,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   you know something was wrong.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Josephus gives us just a hideous tale of what was going on in the family,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   attempted poisonings, one brother against another.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It so rattled Herod that he actually put to death three of his own sons on suspicion of treason.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He put to death his favorite wife out of ten of them.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Mariame was his favorite.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   She was a Hasmonean Maccabean princess, and he put her to death,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and then he killed his mother-in-law, I should have said one of his many mothers-in-law.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He invited the high priest down to Jericho for a swim.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They played a very rough game of water polo, and they drowned him.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   He killed several uncles, a couple of cousins.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Some have said he's a real family man in that negative respect.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   As a matter of fact, Augustus himself, to whom Herod was always very deferent,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   said, "I would rather be Herod's pig than his son."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's a double pun. In Greek it's "souos" and "weos," clever turn of words.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And the other idea is that at least pigs weren't slaughtered for human consumption over there,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and they had a better chance at a longer life.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It was a brilliant pun on the part of Augustus.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yes. And at one point late in his life, Herod plots to kill a stadium full of Jewish leaders.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The plot fails. What does this reveal about him?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Well, Josephus says a very grisly thing to report about Herod in his last months.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He was so paranoid that he, of course, did have some grasp of reality.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   For instance, he was worried that nobody would mourn his own death in the Holy Land.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Of course, it shows how deadly accurate he was.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   They were preparing, again, a general celebration,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and nobody likes to die knowing that they're going to dance in your grave.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And so he was going to give the people something to cry about.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Now it's in 4 BC. He's down at his winter palace in Jericho.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's the only place in the Holy Land that doesn't snow or get cold in the winter.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It's 1,200 feet below sea level. And here he's dying.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   He tries every remedy in the world to stop the gang of diseases that were creeping up on him.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He went to the hot springs at Kalaroli at the northeastern corner of the Dead Sea.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   By the way, there's still springing hot water 2,000 years later.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And that didn't cure him.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And so now he goes back to his winter palace, and he invites his sister Salome in.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And he says, "I want you to arrest all the Jewish leaders in the land and imprison them
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   in the hippodrome just below the palace here."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And that hippodrome has been discovered archaeologically, by the way.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And so she does. And then she says, "Brother, why am I doing this?"
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And Herod says, "Well, I know that when I die, the Jews are going to rejoice.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So I'm going to give them something to cry about."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And so he wants them all executed in that hippodrome so that there'll be thousands of households
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   weeping at the time Herod the Great dies.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So is that the kind of a sweet guy who could have killed the babies in Bethlehem?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I think so.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Most certainly. Goodness.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Speaking of Matthew 2, the Bible records this scene from Herod's paranoia late in his life.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   The wise men alert him to the birth of a new king in Bethlehem.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   He wants to know where so that he can eradicate this new rival.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And the wise men wisely don't return to him.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Herod then responds by slaughtering all the boys 2 years old and under in Bethlehem
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and in all the region, the Bible tells us.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   For all that Josephus writes about Herod, he makes no mention of this.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   In fact, there's no extra biblical evidence that this slaughter ever happened.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   So how do you respond to that?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   No, it's interesting. Josephus does not mention it, and therefore a lot of biblical critics
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   will pounce on that aspect of the nativity account and say, "Therefore it didn't happen."
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Now please understand, this is an argument from silence, and that's the weakest form of argumentation
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   you can use, as we say in the profession, "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And in this case, one or two things could have happened.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Josephus may have heard about it and not used it, because you don't have hundreds of babies killed here.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   You have only about 12, as a matter of fact. Twelve or 15.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The infant mortality in the ancient world was so huge anyway that this is really not going to impress
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   a reader too much, believe it or not. And I think if Josephus is choosing between the two stories
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   about how Herod died right before his death, I think it would take the one where he's going to
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   slaughter hundreds of Jewish leaders. Or he may not have heard about it, again, simply because,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   again, little Bethlehem doesn't amount to much. A little village of 1,500 or so, I did an actuarial study.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Bethlehem at the time, you wouldn't have more than about two dozen babies two years old and under,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   half of them among sex. And so this is not a big deal, and I think that's why Josephus
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   either never heard about it or didn't feel it important enough to record.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So this does not militate against Matthew's version by any means.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   In fact, I was arguing once years ago on the infant massacre with a professor in Wagner College
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   in New York who claimed that this is all fiction, that surely a massacre of hundreds of Jewish
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   boy babies would have come to the attention. Well, I agree, it would have if there had been hundreds.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   But that's ridiculous. A little village that size, they have hundreds of boy babies two years old
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and under? Give me a break. It couldn't possibly be the case.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So, and all the coasts thereof. Well, look, Jerusalem's five miles away, right?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Therefore, this would include Jerusalem as well if we're going to take literally all the coasts thereof.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   We're talking about Bethlehem and probably half a mile around when we're talking about the surroundings of Bethlehem.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Fascinating, and certainly no less a real tragedy.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So finally, as a historian, in your mind, is there any reason to doubt the historicity of the slaughter of the innocents?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I see not one iota of evidence that it could not have happened, and therefore, again, there's no reason to doubt the account as far as I'm concerned.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   To be sure, Luke hasn't heard about it. Remember, Matthew and Luke don't copy from one another when it comes to the Nativity.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And that's good, because this way they can hit it from different angles.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I think it really happened, and let's remember again that the first martyr of Christianity was not Stephen, it was Jesus, but not even Jesus.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   For my money, the first martyr in the Christian Church was the first baby that was killed in Bethlehem, and we always overlook that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Thank you, Paul. That was guest historian Dr. Paul Meyer, joining us for this special Christmas edition of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And from historical controversy, we move to cultural controversy, and tomorrow I'll ask John Paper about Santa Claus.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   A lot of you have emailed in to find out, is Santa harmless fun, or is he a Christmas-time diversion?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   That's the question tomorrow. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. I'll see you then.
