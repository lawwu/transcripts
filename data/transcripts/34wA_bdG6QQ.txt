This is declassified information that was released from the Israeli State Archive that was later reported on by Haaretz. Also, these reports will not tell you that the judge who rules on whether these people continue to live on their homes or not is himself a settler in the West Bank. And we're not even talking about, you know, a loose definition of a settler, but according to international law, this is a settler living illegally in an illegal settlement in the Arctic.

[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.500]   historical right to the land? So if you stretch, not across
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:23.540]   So if you stretch, not across
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.000]   So if you stretch, not across decades, but across centuries

[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.240]   It's a state of destruction.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.000]   It's a state of destruction. Because you don't think of any state
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Because you don't think of any state as having rights.

[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:51.440]  lerini, I feel like. At the core of the situation here is, hate is, or maybe, inability for some group of humans to see the humanity in another group of humans. And so it's important here to talk about the contents of hearts. If we're to think about the long term future of this. Yeah, I mean, I would be concerned, actually, if I didn't.

[00:27:51.440 --> 00:28:21.460]   a lot of people, you know, because they cannot breathe, they cannot live, they are living under excruciating circumstances. You know, first of all, I think that the fact that the people who are angry, the people who are angry, the people who refuse to live under occupation know that they deserve better. People start revolutions not because of some kind of cultural phenomenon, not because of some kind of desire, but because they cannot breathe because they cannot breathe, they cannot live, they cannot live. They are living under excruciating circumstances, you know, first of all these things.

So anger or whatever it is, is a fuel for action? Absolutely. And it has been throughout history. It has been. How much of this tension is religious? In the practical aspects of the courts and the legal system?
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   In the practical aspects of the courts and the legal system? Yes.

How much underneath of it do you feel the division over religious texts and religious beliefs? You know, it's convenient to market what's happening in Palestine as a religious conflict because it allows the listener the luxury of believing that this is an ancient complex.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.980]   You know, it's convenient to market what's happening in Palestine as a religious conflict because it allows the listener the luxury of believing that this is an ancient complicated thing that stretched for thousands and thousands of years ago.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:29.120]   But the fact of the matter is the people who invented Zionism, who pioneered the Zionist movement, who called for emigration and settling into Palestine, a lot of them were atheists.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.420]   A lot of them were not religious at all.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:41.160]   And the leaders of the Israeli state today, a lot of them are atheists.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   And the leaders of the Israeli state today, a lot of them are atheists.

[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.180]   It's easy to say that this is about Muslims and Jews fighting over the land and so on and so forth. But it's not. It's about the land itself and it's about people being forced out of their homes. Benjamin Netanyahu said anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. Of course he said that. Do you disagree? Absolutely, I disagree.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.180]   What is the difference between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism?

And if itï¿½s in a uniform, if it speaks in English, if it has blonde hair, itï¿½s somehow acceptable, itï¿½s okay. We make movies about it. We sell out tickets about it. We make games about it. But if itï¿½s without a uniform, if it has a thick accent, if it has a beard, you know, thatï¿½s condemnable.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:25.340]   Thatï¿½s wrong.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:54.160]   Thatï¿½s terrorism.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   Do you think violence is an effective method of protest and resistance in general?
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   In general, I think it has been, but I believe in fighting on all fronts. I donï¿½t think violence alone is going to bring about change. I think thereï¿½s so much to do in culture and public opinion. Thereï¿½s so much to do in media and fighting back against media, eraser and censorship.

[00:46:54.180 --> 00:47:22.980]  , and I think I would be naive if I donï¿½t take the power imbalance into consideration. One side has makeshift weapons and the other side is one of the most sophisticated armies in the world. So I donï¿½t know how effective violence could be in this case.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:22.980]   But if you look at the flip side, do you see the power of nonviolent resistance?
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:22.980]   No, I donï¿½t know how effective violence could be in this case.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.980]   But if you look at the flip side, do you see the power of nonviolent resistance?

[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:39.360]   So I sense that doing so has not been effective for the Palestinian people.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:55.060]   I think it is. But if you look at the flip side, do you see the power of nonviolent resistance?

I always see my friends, "Oh, you can go to Italy without a visa because you have an Israeli citizenship," but they battle national erasure, they battle crime in their own communities because of police negligence. They battle land confiscation and have battled land confiscation since the '50s.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:31.240]   The West Bank, I think hilariously, George Bush described it as Swiss cheese because of the holes. Every few, every hundred meters there's a new supplement or there's a new method of supply.

[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   and creating different challenges and obstacles for you to deal with, for each group to deal with. You know, it's amazing and impressive that despite these colonial barriers, the real cement ones and the barriers in the mind despite all of these barriers the Palestinian people have maintained their national identity for 70 years. That is incredibly impressive and it also sends a message that as long as we have a boot on our neck, we are going to keep on fighting for the future.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   I think that's a very important thing.

[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   The West Bank is a large region where a lot of Palestinian people live and then there are settlements sprinkled throughout and those settlements have walls around them with security cameras and security guards.

But this whole idea that this is like some kind of war between two religions is so misleading because what's happening is a bunch of, frankly, European settlers with a certain political secular ideology came and relocated here and turned it into a religious conflict between people who have lived harmoniously together for decades before that and you know the whole idea, be it like you know, Christian Zionism or you know, John Hagee or like the calls for do silly the United States and relocate them in Israel or like you know recently we've heard about a long time ago. But recently an Israeli historian confirmed that the Jewish people were not able to come to the United States.

[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:35.740]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:47.740]   So our small victory in the Israeli courts was that they would keep us in our homes until a land registry is completed.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:34:00.060]   Basically, it means that they have to check who owned the land prior and then they could decide if the land is ours or the land belongs to the Israeli

[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:52.540]   Yeah, I mean, let's think of him as a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant writer. And he was prolific. He's authored so much books. Even though he was assassinated in the 70s, but you know, he was 37, if I'm not mistaken, 35 when he was
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:41:21.660]   And he was assassinated. You know, he was an inspiration to me in school, and I remember like, even even my teachers had qualms about him because he was like a secular person. But I love listening to him. He is a beloved figure in the Palestinian community. And I hope to one day be able to see the fraction of what he's achieved in the terms of like shaping a political consciousness for Palestinians and for people in the region.
