[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   Regardless of whatever was written in these books
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.020]   that were written thousands and thousands of years ago,
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.020]   the fact of the matter is no one has a right
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.880]   to go on slaughtering people,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.300]   removing them from their homes,
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.520]   and then continuing to live in their homes,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.880]   continuing to drink coffee on their balconies
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.820]   decades and decades later with no shame,
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.300]   with no introspection, with no reflection.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.980]   No one has the right to do that.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.260]   No one has the right to keep an entire population
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.420]   of people in a cage, which is what's happening
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.100]   to people in the West Bank,
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.980]   who have no freedom of movement,
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.780]   which is what's happening in Gaza,
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.340]   which is blockaded through water, air, and land,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.340]   and is deemed uninhabitable by human rights organizations
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.020]   like the UN.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.520]   No one has a right to do that.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.700]   - The following is a conversation with Mohamed Elkard,
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.260]   a world-renowned Palestinian poet, writer, journalist,
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260]   and an influential voice speaking out
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.840]   and fighting for the Palestinian cause.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.940]   He provides a very different perspective
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.440]   on Israel and Palestine than my previous two episodes
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.580]   with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yuval Noah Harari.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.920]   I hope his story and his words add to your understanding
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.080]   of this part of the world as it did to mine.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.780]   I will continue to have difficult,
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.620]   long-form conversations such as these.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.620]   Always with empathy and humility, but with backbone.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.780]   And please allow me to briefly comment
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.060]   about criticisms I receive of who I am
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.680]   as an interviewer and a human being.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.060]   I am not afraid to travel anywhere
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.340]   or challenge anyone face-to-face,
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.940]   even if it puts my life in danger.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.780]   But I'm also not afraid to be vulnerable,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.420]   to truly listen, to empathize,
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.300]   to walk a mile in the well-worn shoes
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.100]   of those very different from me.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.860]   It's this latter task, not the formal one,
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.920]   that is truly the most challenging,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.140]   in conversations and in life.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.100]   But to me, it is the only way.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.300]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.140]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.300]   in the description.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.860]   And now, dear friends, here's Mohamed Elkard.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.460]   Tell me about Sheik Jarrah,
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.260]   the neighborhood in East Jerusalem where you grew up.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.660]   - Sheik Jarrah is, in a way, a typical neighborhood,
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.660]   despite the absurd reality that surrounds it.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280]   It's a typical neighborhood
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.260]   in terms of Palestinian neighborhoods.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.480]   It's one that is threatened with colonialism,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.020]   with settler expansion, and with forced expulsion.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.100]   And it has been that way since the early '70s.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.180]   My family, like all of the other families in Sheik Jarrah,
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.220]   were expelled from their homes in the Nakba in 1948,
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.420]   and they were forced out by the Haganah
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.020]   and other Zionist parallel militaries
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.780]   that later formed the Israeli military.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.380]   And they were driven to various cities.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.100]   And my grandmother moved from city to city,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.940]   and she ended up in Sheik Jarrah in 1956.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.140]   Sheik Jarrah was established as a refugee housing unit
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.180]   by the United Nations and by the Jordanian government,
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.480]   which had control over that part of Jerusalem at the time.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.680]   And then people lived there harmoniously.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.660]   They were all from different parts of Palestine.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.280]   And they managed to rebuild their lives
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.480]   after the first expulsion.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   And then in the '70s, you had settler organizations,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.540]   many of whom were registered here in New York
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.200]   and in the United States,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.420]   claiming our houses and our lands
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.640]   as their own by divine decree.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.040]   And obviously, because the judges are Israeli,
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.360]   and the laws were written by Israeli settlers,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.920]   and the whole judiciary was established
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.600]   atop the rubble of our homes and villages,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.520]   we had no real pull in the courts.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.400]   The Israeli courts would look at the Israeli documents,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.680]   which we argue are falsifies and fabricated,
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   and they would take them at face value
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.600]   without authentication,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.480]   and they refused to look at our documents.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   They refused to look at the documents
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.920]   from the Jordanian government,
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   the documents from the UN,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.780]   the documents from the Ottoman archives.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.240]   So you already have this kind of asymmetry in the court
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.080]   that for any person with common sense
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.520]   would lead you to believe that this is not,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.440]   in fact, a legal battle or a real estate dispute,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.660]   as the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.720]   likes to frame it,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.260]   but rather a very, very political battle,
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.160]   one that is about social engineering,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.080]   one is about demographics,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.240]   one that is about removing as many Palestinians
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.100]   as possible from occupied Jerusalem.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.620]   So we did what all Palestinian families in Jerusalem do
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.940]   when they're faced with this kind of threat,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.220]   and we bought time.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.020]   We pleaded and pleaded and appealed the courts
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.060]   and appealed the cases,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.060]   and we got over 50 expulsion orders in 2009,
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.240]   rifle-wielding settlers accompanied by police
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.900]   and Israeli military came over
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.680]   and shoved our neighbors outside of their home
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.560]   around 5 a.m.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.720]   It's like, it was the most brutal, violent thing
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.520]   I'd seen as a child at the time,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.460]   and I didn't realize that my turn was coming.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.920]   My turn was next.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.560]   They threw them out in the middle of the night
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.440]   with sound bombs and rubber bullets,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.280]   and they had to live in tents on the street
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.620]   for many, many months,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.280]   and even lived in our front yards for a few months
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.800]   and lived in their cars.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.220]   - Can you link on that process, 2009?
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.180]   You said 50 expulsion orders.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.700]   What was happening?
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.620]   - Between the '70s and 2009,
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.180]   there had been many, dozens of expulsions orders
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.380]   against us and against many other families
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.640]   in the neighborhood, 28 families in total, actually.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.500]   And in 2008, 2009, the first wave of expulsions
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.640]   finally happened.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.340]   It actually began with Umm Kamal al-Qurid.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.500]   We're not related, but we live on the same street
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.760]   in the same neighborhood.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.040]   She was thrown out of her home.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.840]   Her husband, an elderly man also named Muhammad al-Qurid,
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   was pronounced dead on the spot.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   He had a stroke and died.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.440]   The Israeli soldiers pulled him out of his home
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.980]   while he was urinating and threw him into the streets,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.040]   and he died.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.360]   A few months later, the Ghawi and the Hanun families,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.700]   which are kind of not a clan,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.920]   but in Palestine, you have sometimes a building
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.400]   that contains multiple brothers and their wives,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.520]   each have little apartments.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.400]   So the Ghawi and Hanun families, about 35 people,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.120]   were thrown out in the middle of the street,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.260]   right across from us.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.200]   And then by the end of 2009, I had come home from school
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.140]   to find all of my furniture scattered
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.360]   across the length of the street,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.160]   and I saw the settlers, many of whom had American accents,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   living in our house.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.820]   And their justification for this,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.240]   their reasoning for this is divine decree.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.480]   This is what God wants.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.000]   This is the promised land.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.240]   This is so and so, as if God is some kind
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.480]   of real estate agent.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.280]   So they took over half of our home,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.960]   and we continued to be in courts for the following decade.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.640]   I was still a child, and I had broken English,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.160]   and I was talking to all of these diplomats
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.360]   and all of these journalists who would subjugate me
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.160]   to their racism and biases and so on and so forth,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.120]   and I had to prove my humanity time and time again,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.560]   and I had to do all of this, all with broken English.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.520]   And we were lucky even if we got a quote
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.120]   in the article written about us by the Times
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.760]   or so on and so forth.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.000]   Move forward to 2020, I was in New York City
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   studying a master's degree, getting a master's degree,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.280]   and my father calls me, and he tells me,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.320]   we have yet another expulsion order,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   and we decided to launch a campaign.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.080]   It was quite ambitious at the time,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.240]   but the whole objective of the campaign
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   was to demystify what is happening, right?
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.960]   Because it's reported on in the news,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.720]   it's reported on around the world
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.760]   as this real estate dispute, as these evictions,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.200]   which was not really what's happening.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.760]   Evictions do not entail a foreign army
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.400]   in an occupied territory forcibly removing you
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.240]   out of your home.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.960]   So I came home from New York and we launched a campaign
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.080]   which turned into a global success,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.560]   and I believe it was a global success
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.200]   because finally the images on the screen
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.040]   matched the rhetoric that was being said.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   It wasn't so confusing or complicated anymore.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   All of this asymmetry was pronounced and articulated
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.520]   in a way that any viewer, be it in Alabama,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.440]   be it in New York, be it in Egypt,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.920]   was able to understand the asymmetry
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.280]   of the judicial system and the agenda of colonialism
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.360]   that was taking place here.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.480]   And due to immense international and diplomatic pressure
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.760]   from all over the world, even the United States,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.000]   the Israeli Supreme Court was forced
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.080]   to cancel all of the eviction orders in Sheikh Jarrah
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.560]   until further notice.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   This, I consider, was a small victory
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.000]   because obviously we are still at risk of losing our homes
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.360]   once they decide to do the land registry,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.080]   which we can get into a little bit later if you'd like.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.040]   But nonetheless, it was something
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.320]   that we haven't seen before.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.800]   And the fact that the Supreme Court canceled
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.840]   all of these dozens and dozens of past eviction orders,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.960]   it set a precedent, and it also proved
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.640]   that this was a political battle, not a legal one.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.240]   - So let's just add a little more detail
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.520]   to the people who are not familiar
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.040]   with the story with the region,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.920]   with the evictions, with the courts.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.240]   So first of all, Sheikh Jarrah is in East Jerusalem.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.840]   Maybe you can say, what is Jerusalem?
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.760]   Where is it located?
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.720]   What are we talking about in terms of regionally?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.200]   And second, what kind of people that live there?
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.160]   So if you could talk about the Palestinian people.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.560]   And we should also make clear
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.480]   that these evictions is literally people living in homes,
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.520]   and their homes are taken away from them.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.120]   I suppose technically it's legal evictions,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:44.080]   but you're saying that there's a asymmetry of power
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.960]   in the courts where the legal is not so much legal,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.360]   but it's politically and maybe even religiously based.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.120]   - Yeah, I mean, the biggest,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.720]   the most important context here is that oftentimes
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.360]   Americans think that Israel and Palestine
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   are some kind of two neighboring countries
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   that live next to each other and they are at war.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.560]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.760]   Palestinian cities exist all over the country,
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.400]   and it's just one country, it's just one infrastructure,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.640]   and Israel is literally on top of Palestine.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.280]   It was established on top of our villages in the late '40s.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.280]   Now, according to international law,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.840]   the Eastern part of Jerusalem is under occupation.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   So Israeli presence and jurisdiction over the area
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.240]   is completely illegitimate.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.120]   They say the evictions are legal
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.480]   because the settlers write their laws.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.160]   So obviously they're gonna allow settlements to expand,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.760]   but according to international law,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.200]   according to even US policy,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.600]   Israel occupies the Eastern part of Jerusalem.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.080]   Its jurisdiction there is illegitimate.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.520]   We shouldn't even be going to their courts
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.520]   in the first place, but we have no other option.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.120]   We're talking about Jerusalem,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.960]   we're talking about generations and generations
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.280]   and generations of people who have lived there
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.720]   for the longest time, who now, even though,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   for example, me, I don't have a citizenship.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.920]   I'm a resident, a mere resident.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.120]   I have a blue ID card, even though my grandmother
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.040]   and my grandfather were born in Jerusalem,
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.200]   their grandparents were born in Jerusalem.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.680]   Even though we've lived there for generations,
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.360]   but Palestinians in Jerusalem, we are not citizens.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.920]   We're just mere residents.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.320]   Same thing with residents of the occupied Syrian Golan.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.000]   They are not citizens, they are just residents
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.600]   in their own hometowns.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.000]   This is an important piece, but all of this gets convoluted
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.440]   and lost in translation, and I think,
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.240]   I would argue it's a lot more,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   it's, a lot of the time it's dubious, it's malicious,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.320]   the fact that these little pieces of context
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   that frame the entire story get lost.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.480]   You know, I'll talk to you about something else.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.640]   Just 10 minutes, 10 minutes across from my neighborhood,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.400]   Sheikh Jarrah, there's another neighborhood called Silwan,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.280]   and the people in Silwan are also threatened with expulsion,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.720]   but not through evictions, but through home demolitions.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   And if you look at American state,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.080]   American media or Israeli state media,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.520]   you would read the headlines, you know,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   Palestinians living in homes built illegally
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.480]   are gonna face, you know, their homes,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.320]   as they're gonna be torn apart.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.120]   What these headlines don't tell you,
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.880]   and even sometimes, most of the time,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.000]   the substance doesn't tell you,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.360]   that Palestinians seldom ever get
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.960]   building permit applications.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.920]   In fact, recently a spokesperson
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.360]   for the Israeli military confirmed that it was 95%
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.000]   of building permits applications submitted
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   by Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.640]   are rejected by the Israeli authorities.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.280]   And to make this even more absurd,
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.800]   the guy, the councilman who is responsible
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.320]   for rejecting and accepting building permit applications,
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.880]   his name is Yonatan Yussef,
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.680]   and he's an activist in the settler movements,
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.480]   and he's a Jerusalem council member.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.880]   And he, last week, following the expulsion
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.080]   of a Sublaban family in the old city of Jerusalem,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.640]   he posted to his official Facebook account,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.960]   Nakba Now, demanding a second Nakba,
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.000]   promising another Nakba.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.760]   He has done so on many occasions.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.360]   He has chanted with a megaphone just a few months ago,
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.800]   walking down the street in my neighborhood,
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.320]   chanting, "We want Nakba Now."
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.600]   This is a man who has vandalized our murals,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.040]   who has screamed Islamophobic slurs.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.200]   This is literally a man in the government
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.280]   making these decisions, right?
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.560]   And this is similar to, you know,
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.440]   Masaf Riatta in the South Hebron Hills.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.280]   For those who don't know,
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.320]   it's a place in the occupied West Bank
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.800]   where Bedouin and cave dweller Palestinians
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.040]   have lived for generations.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.520]   They have cultivated the land.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.080]   And recently, they were expelled from their homes.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.400]   Over a thousand people were expelled
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.840]   from their remote small villages.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.480]   Again, if you're reading American media,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.200]   they would say, it would say,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.840]   "Palestinians living in firing zones were removed
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.880]   "because they were living in a military zone."
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.200]   What these media reports will not tell you,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.840]   that in the '80s, the Israeli government
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.080]   purposefully classified many lands
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.120]   in the occupied West Bank as firing zones,
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.800]   as off-limit military zones,
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.160]   for the sole purpose of expelling the residents.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   And this is not some kind of conspiracy theory.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.280]   This is declassified information
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.800]   that was released from the Israeli State Archive
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.040]   that was later reported on by Haaretz.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.000]   Also, these reports will not tell you
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.280]   that the judge who rules on whether these people
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.920]   continue to live in their homes or not
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.680]   is himself a settler in the West Bank.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.000]   And I'm not even talking about, you know,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.120]   a loose definition of a settler,
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   but according to international law,
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.600]   this is a settler living illegally
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   in an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.680]   This is the judiciary that we deal with,
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.840]   which is hilarious considering how it's being reported on
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.160]   in American media recently as some kind of beacon
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.400]   of progress and democracy
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.680]   that the new government is trying to undermine.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.520]   - So there's no representation in the courts
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.760]   for the Palestinian people?
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.120]   - I mean, we have lawyers, but no, there's no,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.040]   in fact, there is, for Palestinians
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.240]   with Israeli citizenships, for example,
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.200]   there's over 60 laws that specifically
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.360]   and explicitly discriminates against them.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.000]   - So again, it's technically legal.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.920]   The evictions and the demolitions.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.640]   - Yeah, so was Jim Crow was legal also, you know.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.840]   - When something is legal, it can also still be wrong.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.880]   - Absolutely.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   History has shown us time and time again
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.200]   that legality does not necessarily mean morality.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.560]   And the law, you know, is a,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.240]   the law is a bloodbath in many ways.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.960]   It has been used and abused to facilitate
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.880]   the most horrendous atrocities.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.720]   And in the case of the Palestinians,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   the law has served to facilitate
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.120]   and bureaucratize our ethnic cleansing.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.360]   - Do you think there's people, judges,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.560]   and just people in power in the judiciary
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.720]   that have hate for the Palestinian people?
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.240]   - I mean, I'm not really,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.160]   I mean, the easy, simplistic answer is yes,
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.760]   but I don't really care about the contents of their hearts,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.840]   what I care about the policy they enact, right?
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   The laws they write and enact are hateful.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.400]   Demolishing a person's home
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.120]   so you can have somebody from Long Island, New York,
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.640]   who's fleeing, you know, fraud charges,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.440]   this is the case in my house,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.480]   live in their, you know, front yard, that's hateful.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.360]   So I don't need, you know, confirmation.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.200]   This is something we see a lot, actually, you know,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.640]   Palestinians and people who are pro-Palestine
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.440]   and just people who wanna make a difference
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.160]   in how this cause is represented,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.040]   we often run for the first opportunity
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.640]   to cite an Israeli being hateful.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.160]   You know, the recent, the last Israeli prime minister
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.000]   said that he has killed many Arabs
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.720]   and that he has no qualms with it.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.720]   Netanyahu has said a slew of racist, hateful things.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.200]   Jabotinsky, the pioneer of Zionism,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.520]   Herzl, one of the pioneers of Zionism,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.720]   all have said horrible, hateful things.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.000]   We also, like, cannot wait to, you know,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.240]   cite a confession from a former Israeli soldier
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.600]   whose guilty conscience is keeping them, you know,
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.680]   up at night, and we use all of these, you know,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.400]   confessions or slip-ups as evidence
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   to prove that this is a racist country
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.000]   that is enacting racist acts, but we don't need this
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.080]   because the material proof is on the ground.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.040]   You see it in the policies that are enacted.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   You see it in how the country,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.120]   how this regime has behaved for the past 75 years.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   I don't need, you know, confessions
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.960]   from the likes of Netanyahu to understand
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.480]   that his heart is full of hate.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.720]   - So if you could return to 1948 and describe
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.000]   something that you've mentioned, the Nakba,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.760]   which means catastrophe in Arabic,
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.200]   what was this event?
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.920]   What was this displacement and dispossession
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.000]   of Palestinians in 1948?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.840]   - Well, you know, like, May 15th, 1948
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.200]   is commemorated every year as, you know,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.080]   the anniversary of the Nakba,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.600]   but I would even argue anything.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.760]   This is like a very popular idea
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.640]   is that the Nakba did not begin or end in 1948.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.440]   The '48 was rather, you know, a crystallization
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.680]   of the Zionist enterprise in Palestine.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.960]   And what happened was is that many Zionist paramilitaries
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:21.040]   that again today merged and made the Israeli army,
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.640]   which calls itself the Israeli Defense Forces,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.200]   even though they're literally always the aggressor,
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.440]   committed atrocities and massacres,
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   and, you know, they destroyed over 500 villages,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.960]   they killed over 15,000 people,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.760]   they forced a very large portion,
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.400]   a majority of the Palestinian population
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.600]   to flee their homes.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.160]   And this was, you know, the near total destruction
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.240]   of Palestinian society that continues on to this day.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.320]   We refer to it as the ongoing Nakba,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.520]   and you see it in Sheikh Jarrah,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.640]   you see it in Silwan, you see it in Heron,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.560]   and all of these people losing their homes.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.200]   And in many cases, time and time again, you know,
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.640]   I grew up and my grandmother told me the stories
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.480]   about the Nakba.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.320]   She told me stories about her neighbors
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.440]   who were running away in a panic
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.720]   and they had mistaken a pillow for their offspring,
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.800]   and they just took it with them,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.640]   and they realized later that they forgot their child
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.560]   and they came back for it.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.280]   Many, many people who were separated from their,
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.360]   my grandmother herself, she lost her husband
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.040]   for a few months, for nine months.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.760]   He was imprisoned by the Israelis.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.120]   You know, she told me all of these stories,
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.680]   and she wasn't just reminiscing about them.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.280]   She was, you know, letting me know
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   that this is still happening,
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.720]   and I didn't need to grow up that old
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.080]   to see it happening in my own front yard,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.960]   to see that expulsion happen in the same fashion
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.640]   she's talked about it.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.120]   But, you know, now they have replaced their artillery
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.360]   with the judiciary.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.680]   They have replaced, you know, the slashing
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.160]   of the pregnant women's bellies in the Deir Yassin massacre
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.360]   with laws that say, you know,
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.280]   you're not legally allowed to be here.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.120]   We're gonna kick you out of your home.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.920]   And it's happening, and it has happened in broad daylight.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.440]   One piece of context for the listener
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.280]   who is not familiar with the Nakba
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.400]   is the Balfour Declaration, which was a promise,
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.320]   quote unquote, promise made by the British
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.800]   to the Zionist movement in 1917,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.880]   committing to the establishment,
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.360]   I'm quoting, I think, word for word,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.520]   committing to the establishment
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.280]   of a Jewish state in Palestine,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.200]   as if Palestine was, you know, the British to give away.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.120]   And there was this whole movement
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.160]   that called for colonization of Palestine.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.520]   And there were different schools of thought in Zionism.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.920]   You know, people like Zangwell said
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.160]   that this was a country without a people.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.760]   And Palestinians who have existed there,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.320]   who have cultivated the lands, who have, you know,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   had diverse cultural and religious and political practices,
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.720]   they were completely erased.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.840]   And other people like Jabotinsky
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.000]   were a lot more explicit and a lot more honest
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.640]   and said that we need to fight the Palestinians
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.000]   because they love their land,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.840]   much like the red Indians love their lands.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.840]   And he had a paper called
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.520]   "The Iron Wall Colonization of Palestine Must Go Forward."
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.400]   And all of these schools of thoughts
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.480]   were then shopping around for, you know,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.960]   imperialist support for their cause.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.840]   They tried to get support from the Ottoman Empire.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.960]   They tried to get support from Germany.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.000]   And this is in the 1800s.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.480]   And then they got support from the United Kingdom.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.720]   A great book to recommend is
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.280]   "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine" by Rashid Khalidi.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.680]   That, you know, traces the Zionist movement,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.480]   oftentimes in the Zionist's own words.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.240]   And so today what we're seeing is a continuation.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.960]   And, you know, people like Jabotinsky
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.680]   who are like profoundly and explicitly racist,
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.640]   who have called for genocide,
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.720]   who have called the Palestinians barbaric,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.520]   who have said and done racist things, you know,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.880]   Jabotinsky also was like the founder of the Ergun,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.080]   one of the other militias that later merged
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.680]   to become the Israeli army,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.920]   which was responsible for the Deir Yassin massacre,
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.440]   which was responsible for the bombing
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.680]   of the King David Hotel.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.200]   This is a person who still celebrated in Israeli society.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.000]   There are still streets named after him
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.960]   and Netanyahu just two weeks ago,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.440]   if I'm not mistaken, honored him in a public celebration.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.920]   So this is Zionism.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.280]   It's not even through my own words.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.920]   - What do you say to people that describe Israel
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.680]   as having historical right to the land?
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.920]   So if you stretch not across decades,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.760]   but across centuries into the past.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.920]   - This kind of thing is a red herring.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.560]   It's a distraction because you don't think of any state
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.600]   as having rights, but there is this exceptionalism
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.640]   to the Israeli regime, where it has a right
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.520]   to defend itself and it has a right to the land
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.200]   and it has a right to shoot 14 year old boys
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.800]   because it thought they had a knife in their pockets.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.000]   You know, a lot of the time people cite the Torah
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.880]   and cite religious books.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.360]   And, you know, sometimes Zionists will even say like,
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.440]   read the Quran and blah, blah, blah.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.560]   You know, regardless of whatever was written in these books
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.760]   that were written thousands and thousands of years ago,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   the fact of the matter is no one has a right
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.600]   to go on slaughtering people,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.040]   removing them from their homes
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.240]   and then continuing to live in their homes,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.600]   continuing to drink coffee on their balconies
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.560]   decades and decades later with no shame,
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.040]   with no introspection, with no reflection.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.720]   No one has the right to do that.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.000]   No one has the right to keep an entire population
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.160]   of people in a cage, which is what's happening
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.720]   to people in the West Bank who have no freedom of movement,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   which is what's happening in Gaza,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.080]   which is blockaded through water, air and land
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   and is deemed uninhabitable by human rights organizations
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.800]   like the UN.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.000]   No one has a right to do that.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.560]   - Do you have hate in your heart for Israel?
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.820]   - Why does that matter?
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.280]   - As one human being to another,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.680]   you're describing quite brilliantly
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.400]   that the contents of people's hearts don't matter
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.000]   as much as the policies and the contents of the courts
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.240]   and the laws and what actually is going on on the streets
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.320]   in terms of actions.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.880]   But this is also a human story.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.720]   - Yeah.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   - And I feel like at the core of the situation here is hate
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:37.280]   or maybe inability for some group of humans
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.480]   to see the humanity in another group of humans.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.160]   And so it's important here to talk about
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.840]   the contents of hearts.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.520]   If we were to think about the long-term future of this.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I would be concerned actually
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.800]   if I didn't feel some kind of way in my heart.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.520]   I would be concerned for my own dignity
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.480]   because the people who revolt, the people who are angry,
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.760]   the people who refuse to live under occupation
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.260]   know that they deserve better.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.120]   People start revolutions not because
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.880]   of some kind of cultural phenomenon,
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.320]   not because of some kind of desire,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.720]   but because they cannot breathe,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.280]   because they cannot breathe, they cannot live.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.040]   They are living under excruciating circumstances.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.840]   Palestinians, I don't know how many Palestinians
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.040]   have interacted with,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.560]   but we are some of the most wonderful people.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.720]   I mean, not all of us, I think some of us are insufferable,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.640]   but most of us, you know,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.340]   most of us, you know, we're very hospitable.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.560]   We're very hospitable, even like in the early correspondence
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.880]   between the mayor of Jerusalem and Herzl
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.920]   who wrote "The Jewish State,"
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.000]   you know, the generosity through which
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.360]   the Palestinian mayor was talking to Herzl
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.320]   who was plotting to take over his land
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   is impressive and at the same time, you know, heart-wrenching
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   and, but I personally think there is,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:12.040]   there's a lot of dignity in negating your oppressor.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.880]   And I think it would be ridiculous today
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.600]   if we like look back at Jim Crow, for example,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.360]   and we ask the person who's lived under Jim Crow
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.200]   if they have hate in their heart for Jim Crow
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.440]   as if that's not the absolutely logical
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.560]   and natural sentiment to feel.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.680]   - In Rivka, you wrote, "My father told me
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.280]   "anger is a luxury we cannot afford.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.520]   "Be composed, calm, still, laugh when they ask you,
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.640]   "smile when they talk, answer them, educate them."
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.920]   So let me linger on this,
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.400]   is there anger in there, in your heart?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.360]   And does it cloud your judgment?
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.000]   - Does it cloud my judgment?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.720]   I don't think so.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.480]   I think our campaign to defend our homes
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.480]   was particularly successful
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:07.440]   because it was honest to what was happening on the ground,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   because it refused to follow the strategy
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.200]   that we have used in our advocacy before,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.560]   where we shrink ourselves and we turn the other cheek
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.320]   and we try to convince American lawmakers
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.080]   and American diplomats and journalists of our humanity.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.720]   Because we wait for their approval.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.320]   I was 14 years old when I first flew to Congress
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.240]   to speak to Congress people
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.720]   and to speak at the European Parliament.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.080]   And at the time I thought,
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.600]   "Wow, I must be such a brilliant 14-year-old
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.560]   "for them to have me here."
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.240]   And looking back, I didn't know what I was talking about.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.440]   I had horrendously broken English
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.120]   and I didn't have any talking points.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.560]   And I came to realize that the reason why we send our kids
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.920]   with their PowerPoints to the Hill
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.640]   is because of the racism and the hatred that lingers
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.840]   inside the hearts of American politicians
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.960]   who refuse to sit on the table
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.160]   with Palestinian adults as equals.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.480]   And so we resort to sending our kids who will not threaten
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.840]   and who will not trigger the biases
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.040]   they have against Muslims and Arab people,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.400]   which Palestinians, even though we're not all Muslim,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.840]   are racialized as Muslim.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   And this is why we emphasize the deaths of women
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.640]   and children as though the deaths of our men
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.800]   does not count or does not matter.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.040]   All of these things, I think the new generation
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.400]   of Palestinians is rebelling against.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.760]   I think words like, you know, I think it's loaded.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.960]   It's loaded language, anger and angry and hate
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.480]   and so on and so forth, because it mischaracterizes people
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.040]   and it kind of delegitimizes them a little bit.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.080]   You know, I think the real anger is the bulldozer
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.600]   bulldozing through my house.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.680]   I think the real anger is the 18-year-old soldier
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.640]   who refuses to see me as a human being
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.240]   and strip searches me every chance they get.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.160]   That's where the real anger lies.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:15.760]   And I'm quite honestly proud of, you know,
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.480]   our unabashedness and our refusal to, like,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.360]   bow our heads or bury our heads in the sand.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.600]   I think that's the only way forward.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   - So anger, whatever it is, is a fuel for action.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.200]   - Absolutely, and it has been throughout history.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.040]   It has been.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.200]   - How much of this tension is religious?
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.320]   In the practical aspects of the courts
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.680]   and the evictions and the demolitions,
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.320]   and you mentioned something, divine decree.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.480]   How much underneath of it do you feel
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.080]   the division over religious texts and religious beliefs?
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.440]   - You know, it's convenient to market
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.520]   what's happening in Palestine as a religious conflict,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.080]   because it allows the listener the luxury
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.240]   of believing that this is an ancient, complicated thing
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.920]   that stretches thousands and thousands of years ago.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.440]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.360]   the people who invented Zionism,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.800]   who pioneered the Zionist movement,
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.080]   who called for emigration and settling into Palestine,
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.120]   a lot of them were atheists.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.000]   A lot of them were not religious at all.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.200]   And the leaders of the Israeli state today,
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.120]   a lot of them are atheists,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.080]   and a lot of them are secular, and so on and so forth.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.480]   It's easy to say that this is,
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.920]   you know, about Muslims and Jews fighting over the land,
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.080]   and so on and so forth, but it's not.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.280]   It's about the land itself,
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.480]   and it's about people being forced out of their homes.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.920]   - Benjamin Netanyahu said, "Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism."
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.160]   - Of course he said that.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.120]   - Do you disagree?
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.040]   - Absolutely, I disagree.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.600]   - What's the gap between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism?
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.440]   Those who are against the policies of Israel
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:24.360]   versus those who are against the Jewish people.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.200]   - I watched the first 20 minutes,
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.240]   and then I couldn't do it anymore.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.640]   But I watched, and then what was interesting
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.400]   about Netanyahu is that he said,
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.920]   "Being anti-Zionist is like saying I'm okay with the Jews.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   "I just don't believe the Jews have a right
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.720]   "to form their own state.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.760]   "That's like saying I'm okay with Americans.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.520]   "I'm just not okay with Americans having their own state."
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.680]   And there is so much wrong with that statement
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.560]   in the sense that Jewish people are a religious group,
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.240]   and Americans, and being an American is a nationality
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   that consists of a diversity of religions,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.360]   and so on and so forth.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.120]   First of all, and the second thing
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.800]   that's wrong with that statement is the whole idea
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.640]   that states somehow have a right to exist or whatever.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.720]   It's such a distraction.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.880]   You have people getting shot in the street.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.280]   You have millions and millions of people besieged.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.120]   You have people losing their homes.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.040]   You have people who are held in Israeli prisons
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.120]   without trial or charge indefinitely.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.480]   But the conversations that are being held on the Hill,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.280]   the conversations that are being held on CNN,
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.800]   are does Israel has a right to exist,
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.760]   or why would you negate Israel's having a right to exist?
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.600]   That's one.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   Now, of course, I just find it's ridiculous, again,
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.120]   that opposing a secular political movement
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.200]   that was explicitly colonialist, expansionist,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.360]   exclusive, and racist through the words of its own authors
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.120]   is somehow, and also, again, opposing such a political
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.160]   movement that is quite young and quite recent
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   is somehow equivalent to opposing a religion
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.320]   that is thousands and thousands of years old.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.280]   But it is convenient, again, for Israeli politicians
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.240]   to frame us who oppose Zionism,
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.800]   a form of racism and bigotry, as anti-Semites.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.280]   But I can guarantee you Benjamin Netanyahu
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.040]   has no problem with anti-Semitism.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.440]   This is the same man who has no problem getting on stage
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.960]   and shaking hands with Pastor John Hagee,
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.720]   doing webinars with Pastor John Hagee.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.400]   For those who don't know, Pastor John Hagee
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.720]   is the founder of Christians United for Israel
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.400]   who has said on multiple occasions that Hitler was a hunter
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.320]   who was sent to hunt the Jews,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.600]   who said on multiple occasions that Jewish people
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.080]   are gonna perish in hell.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.200]   You can, all of this is like very viable by Google.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.280]   And this is one of the Israeli regime's closest allies.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.560]   So the Israeli regime does not have a problem
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.240]   with anti-Semites when it serves its interests.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.080]   It has a problem.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.720]   I mean, like if you look at evangelicals
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.200]   or like Christian Zionism at large,
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   anti-Semitism lies at the heart of Christian Zionism.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.720]   It's the idea that we wanna drive all of the Jews
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.320]   outside of the United States
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   so that Armageddon could happen or whatever the fuck.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.240]   This accusation has been a muzzle.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.480]   It has been used as a muzzle
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.360]   to silence political opposition
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.000]   and to stifle political advocacy
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.080]   for the liberation of Palestine.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.120]   And a lot of the time people get caught up in denouncing it
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.480]   and in justifying themselves and disclaimers
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.800]   and so on and so forth, that you lose the point,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.440]   that you're distracted from the focal point.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.000]   That is, there is an ongoing colonialism happening
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.400]   where people every single day are killed.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.680]   I cannot keep count.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.480]   This morning, a kid was shot in Palestine.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.520]   It's embarrassing even for me
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.960]   that I don't even know the numbers here.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.320]   But this muzzle has been effective.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.160]   And I think the only righteous option
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.640]   is to oppose these labels,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.560]   these smear campaigns that target us.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.560]   I myself have been labeled an anti-Semite by the ADL.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.160]   And I mean, if you want to talk about that surface level,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   people will say, "Wow, the ADL, Anti-Defamation League,
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.760]   "condemned you."
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.960]   But people do not look at the history
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.080]   of the Anti-Defamation League,
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.880]   do not look at the present of the Anti-Defamation League.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.400]   The fact that they are the largest
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.480]   non-governmental police training department in the country
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.920]   where they train police in racial profiling and militarism.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.640]   The fact that they have historically
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.920]   and continue to have engaged in surveillance
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.640]   on black liberation movements,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.920]   on anti-apartheid South African activists.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.760]   Most recently in Charlottesville,
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.680]   when white supremacists were marching
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.800]   and chanting anti-Semitic shit,
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.440]   the ADL advised local police departments
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.760]   to spy on the black organizers
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.920]   opposing the white supremacists.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.200]   This is, again, all verifiable on the internet.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.240]   Go to droptheADL.org.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   - So the ADL does not alleviate
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.680]   the hate in the world,
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.560]   as it probably is designed to do.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.880]   - No, it's the guys.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.000]   I don't think the Apartheid Defense League
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.440]   is really our most progressive.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.520]   - That's what it stands for.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.800]   - Yeah, in case you didn't know, now you know.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:16.680]   - If we could just linger on this idea of anti-Semitism,
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.200]   there's quite a bit of anti-Muslim sentiment
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.280]   in the United States, especially after 9/11.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.480]   I've spoken to people about that.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   There's also anti-Jewish, anti-Semitism sentiment
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.400]   in the United States, but also throughout human history.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   What do you make about this kind of fact of human nature
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   that people seem to hate Jews throughout history,
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.880]   especially in the 20th century,
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.440]   especially with Nazi Germany?
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.680]   What are your, in general, thoughts
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.560]   about the hatred of the Jewish people?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.520]   - I mean, I think it's obviously wrong.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.360]   I don't know.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.040]   It's this idea that I even have to clarify
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.400]   when I think about anti-Semitism that doesn't sit right
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.280]   well with me.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.640]   I think it's completely unfortunate and wrong
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.880]   that Jewish people have been persecuted across history.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.360]   - So one of the criticisms,
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.600]   I think I've read the ADL making this criticism of you,
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.360]   is maybe you've tweeted a comparison
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.080]   between Israel and Hitler,
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.880]   and thereby diminishing the evil that is Hitler.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.120]   What would you say to that?
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.440]   - Amos Azar talks about this a lot,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.320]   the exceptionalization of Hitler.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.240]   Hitler is a deplorable, I don't know,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:48.200]   condemnable, rotten, racist, horrible human being
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.720]   that belongs in the depths of hell.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.000]   Obviously, that goes without saying,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   but I am allowed analogy,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.360]   and I'm allowed to say whatever I want.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.880]   Now, I don't necessarily think that such an analogy
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.400]   is a good strategy to have,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   but at the time, the context came in 2021
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:22.120]   when Israeli soldiers and policemen and settlers
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.360]   were literally burning down our neighborhood,
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.120]   again, verifiable by Google.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.320]   And I tweeted it, and also, I remember I tweeted something,
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.360]   I hope every single one of them dies.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.400]   And to this day, this is some kind of gotcha for me,
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.440]   as if I should have tweeted,
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.280]   oh, here's the apple pie for every single soldier
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.120]   that's throwing tear gas in my house.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:49.760]   There is such an exceptionalism
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.120]   when it comes to Palestinians.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.000]   We're not allowed analogy, we're not allowed expression,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.560]   we're not allowed armed resistance,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.920]   we're not allowed peaceful resistance,
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.080]   we're not allowed to boycott, because that's anti-Semitic,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.760]   we're not allowed to do anything.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.560]   So what are we allowed?
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.520]   If I can't boycott, and that's against American law
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.000]   not to boycott, and if I can't pick up a rifle,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.560]   because that's against the law,
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.720]   and if I can't even tweet my frustration out,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.920]   what am I allowed to do?
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.320]   Maybe Netanyahu can send me a manual he's happy with.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.200]   - So you've spoken about the taking of homes,
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   the IDF killing civilians, killing children.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.440]   What about the violence going the other direction?
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.680]   Israelis being killed, in part, by terrorist action?
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.400]   - Well, it depends on how you define terrorism, right?
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.200]   Across history, one man's freedom fighter
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.760]   is another man's terrorist.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:53.640]   I don't necessarily subscribe to the definition of terrorism.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   If a foreign army is in my neighborhood,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.160]   which it's not supposed to be in,
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.660]   and they're shooting live ammunition at my house,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.240]   I'm allowed to do what I'm allowed to do.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.320]   And again, this is yet another case
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.440]   of Palestinian exceptionalism,
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.680]   because when it comes to Ukraine,
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.640]   people have no problem seeing Ukrainians
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:20.520]   defending their homes, seeing Ukrainians dying for their land,
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   seeing Ukrainians making makeshift Molotovs on Sky News.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.560]   Sky News was running Molotov-making cocktails.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.880]   The New York Times ran an article
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.680]   interviewing a Ukrainian psychologist
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.400]   who said that hatred, I'm paraphrasing,
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   but he said hatred for all Russians
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.720]   is actually a healthy outlet.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.480]   The New York Post ran a headline
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   championing quote-unquote heroic Ukrainian suicide bomber.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:52.800]   These things we would not even dream of as Palestinians.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.400]   We are told to turn the other cheek time and time again.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.000]   We're told that we should continue living
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.120]   inside these enclaves without access to clean water,
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.100]   without access to the right to movement,
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.880]   without access to building permits,
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.160]   without our natural right to expansion,
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.240]   without a guarantee that if we leave our house,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.600]   we're not gonna be shot,
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.040]   and we're supposed to not do anything about it.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.920]   That is absurd.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.800]   Any person watching this understands this completely.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.960]   People understand.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.120]   People understand that if somebody is attacking your home,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:26.960]   you fight back.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.200]   If somebody is attacking your family, you fight back.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.920]   That is not.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.400]   But again, who gets to call who a terrorist?
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.000]   Who gets to define terrorism?
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.280]   This is all about who has power.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.680]   Who gets to write these laws?
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.520]   Who gets to write these definitions?
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.680]   Why is it that American actions
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.840]   and Iraq is not called terrorism by American politicians?
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.320]   Violence is like this mutating concept,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.420]   and it takes on many shapes and forms,
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:05.360]   and if it's in a uniform, if it speaks in English,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.240]   if it has blonde hair, it's somehow acceptable.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.080]   It's okay.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.620]   We make movies about it.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.680]   We sell out tickets about it.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.320]   We make games about it.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.520]   But if it's without a uniform,
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.760]   if it has a thick accent, if it has a beard,
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.640]   that's condemnable.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.460]   That's wrong.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.500]   That's terrorism.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.820]   - Do you think violence is an effective method
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.400]   of protest and resistance in general?
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.280]   - In general, I think it has been.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.480]   I think, you know, I believe in fighting on all fronts.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.840]   I don't think violence alone is gonna bring about change.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.840]   I think there's so much to do in culture
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.800]   and shifting public opinion.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.040]   There's so much to do in media
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   and fighting back against media,
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.160]   erasure and censorship.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.800]   There's so much to do diplomatically and politically.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.620]   And I think I would be naive
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.620]   if I don't take the power imbalance into consideration.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:11.560]   One side has makeshift weapons
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.280]   and the other side is one of the most sophisticated armies
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.580]   in the world.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.820]   So I don't know.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.660]   I don't know how effective violence could be in this case.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.820]   - But if you look at the flip side,
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.680]   do you see the power of nonviolent resistance?
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.900]   So Martin Luther King, Gandhi,
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.940]   the power of turning the other cheek.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.860]   He spoke negatively about turning the other cheek.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.700]   - Yeah.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.280]   - Do you, so I sense that doing so
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.060]   has not been effective for the Palestinian people.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.720]   - We've turned the other cheek generation after generation.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.300]   There is this Zionist trope that is used against us.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.600]   They say Palestinian rejectionism.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.960]   They say that we reject everything.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.420]   But if you look at the history, like our leadership,
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.780]   the Palestinian Authority has given up inch after inch,
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.260]   has compromised on acre after acre,
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:05.500]   has signed deal after deal after deal after deal,
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.780]   and still there is no peace.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.820]   So turning the other cheek is not, you know,
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.780]   the most effective method in my book.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.820]   - What are the top obstacles to peaceful coexistence
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.380]   of Israelis and Palestinians?
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.980]   - The occupation comes to mind,
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.580]   the shoot to kill policies come to mind,
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.420]   the siege comes to mind,
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.000]   the asymmetry of the judiciary comes to mind.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.820]   The whole system needs to be dismantled.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.260]   I will quote my dear friend Rabih Ghabariya,
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.580]   who's a lawyer who says, you know,
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:45.400]   the solution, justice comes about through recognition,
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.020]   return, and redistribution.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.300]   There are millions of Palestinian refugees
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.380]   who are living in excruciating circumstances
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.380]   in refugee camps around the world.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.500]   There are thousands of Palestinian prisoners
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.180]   who are held in prisons for defending their homes,
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.040]   hundreds of which are held without charge or trial,
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:07.980]   by the way.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.780]   There are many Palestinians who get killed
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.380]   in broad daylight with no recourse,
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.620]   journalists and medics and everyday people,
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.180]   not just the freedom fighters.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.820]   We need, again, recognition, return,
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.460]   and redistribution.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.900]   And peace comes about when they stop killing us,
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.460]   when they stop keeping us in a cage.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.740]   I mean, that's quite simple.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.780]   - Can you describe recognition,
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.380]   redistribution, return, and redistribution?
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.860]   - Return, right of return,
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.360]   the right of return to all of the Palestinian refugees
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.660]   to their homes.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.500]   You know, when I'm driving around Haifa
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.020]   and I see my grandmother's home
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.900]   that's now turned into a restaurant,
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.940]   I could have, you know,
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.460]   I made a joke in one of my essays recently
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.900]   that had I had that, I could have had it all,
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.060]   you know, the beachfront views,
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.820]   her smug attitude, you know,
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.580]   she grew up by the sea
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:10.420]   after she relocated to Haifa after Jerusalem.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:14.100]   We want that, we want that.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.780]   You know, they're lucky I don't want Netanyahu's home,
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.260]   but I just want my home.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.100]   I just want my home.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:19.940]   We want to return.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.660]   I also, there needs, you know,
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.780]   in like, I believe in the 1960s,
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.500]   the Israeli government classified 90%
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.860]   of all of historic Palestine as state-owned land.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.900]   This is all land that was owned by Palestinian farmers
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.140]   who have cultivated their lands for decades.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.540]   You know, since the establishment of the Israeli state,
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.620]   there has been Jewish-only towns popping up
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.220]   every few years, and not one town,
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.420]   not one Palestinian town has emerged.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.020]   We are, even those of us who have Israeli citizenship
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.700]   who live outside of the wall are encircled
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.180]   and cannot have their natural community growth
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.200]   in their towns.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.980]   That needs to change.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.220]   That needs to change.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.100]   - You mentioned the wall.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.500]   Can you describe the wall?
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.180]   - The wall is a nine-meter high cement wall
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.260]   that was finished in 2003.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.580]   And if you're American,
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.460]   you've probably heard the whitewashed,
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.180]   sanitized version of the name,
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.980]   which is the security wall.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.020]   But it's a wall that literally has stolen
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:26.180]   thousands of dunams of land and has ripped apart families.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.300]   My mother is a poet, or was a poet at some point,
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:32.260]   and she had this poem she published in the paper
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.220]   called "Love Behind the Wall," and it describes,
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.020]   you know, it's a poem, but it describes
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   a real-life situation of two families
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.100]   who lived right across the street from each other,
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.180]   but were then separated by the wall,
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.660]   and they would fly balloons, you know,
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.100]   to see each other from each side of the wall
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:52.940]   or something like that.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.740]   This, although it sounds absurd,
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.660]   but it's the reality for many Palestinian families
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.740]   whose lives were torn apart,
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:03.460]   whose livelihoods also were torn apart by the wall.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.580]   Maybe this is a good opportunity to talk about
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.820]   the legal classifications for Palestinians.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:12.380]   You know, Israel, much like any other colonial entity,
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.940]   has divided and fragmented the Palestinian people.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.220]   As I said earlier, I have a blue ID,
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.780]   which means I'm a resident.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.700]   A friend of mine who lives in Haifa, for example,
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.140]   two hours away from me, 150 kilometers,
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.620]   nothing too bad in this country,
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.460]   has an Israeli citizenship.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:37.660]   He can, you know, travel, he can enter the West Bank,
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.380]   he can do a lot more, he's a citizen,
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.780]   he can vote if he wants to, not that we want to.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.340]   You know, I always tease my friends,
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.300]   oh, you can go to Italy without a visa
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.980]   because you have an Israeli citizenship.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.260]   But, you know, they battle national erasure,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.620]   they battle crime in their own communities
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.540]   because of police negligence.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.940]   They battle land confiscation
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.260]   and have battled land confiscations in the '50s.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.980]   Whereas somebody with a green ID,
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:11.300]   somebody from the West Bank cannot leave the West Bank,
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.620]   cannot go anywhere without a special permit
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.340]   and lives behind these walls.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.420]   And even within the West Bank,
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.980]   the West Bank, I think hilariously,
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.140]   George Bush described it as Swiss cheese
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.900]   because of the holes, every few,
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.700]   every hundred meters there's a new settlement
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.380]   or there's a new military checkpoint.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.260]   So even if you live behind the wall in the West Bank
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.420]   with your green ID,
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:41.260]   even though you're robbed of your right to movement,
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.020]   you still even can't move from town to town
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.980]   within the West Bank without encountering settler violence
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.860]   or military violence while you're crossing the checkpoints
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:50.980]   and so on and so forth.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.380]   And then the last category we have
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.060]   is people who live in Gaza.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.860]   We are talking about over 2 million people
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.100]   who live in an open air prison,
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:03.220]   who have no right to movement,
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.460]   but also have no access to clean water,
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.500]   no access to supplies, no access to good food,
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.780]   no access to good healthcare and so on and so forth,
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:14.700]   who routinely get bombarded every few years.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.380]   Gaza is like two hours away from my house.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.940]   It feels like an absolute faraway planet
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.060]   because it's so isolated from the rest of the country.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.900]   So imagine all of these different legal statuses
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:32.300]   fragmenting your everyday identity
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.700]   and creating different challenges and obstacles
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.980]   for you to deal with, for each group to deal with.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   You know, it's amazing and impressive
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.220]   that despite these colonial barriers,
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:47.220]   the real cement ones and the barriers in the mind,
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.980]   despite all of these barriers,
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.580]   the Palestinian people have maintained
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.980]   their national identity for 70 years.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.540]   That is incredibly impressive.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.300]   And it also sends a message
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.980]   that as long as we have a boot on our neck,
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   we're going to continue fighting, you know,
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.420]   violence, cracking down on refugee camps,
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.700]   bombarding refugee camps is only
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.940]   gonna bring about more violence.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.180]   - So West Bank is a large region
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.820]   where a lot of Palestinian people live
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.980]   and then there's settlements sprinkled throughout
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.860]   and those settlements have walls around them
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.340]   with security cameras.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.340]   - And security guards.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.180]   - Security guards.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.100]   - There's almost a million settlers in the West Bank.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.780]   - And so what are the different cities here,
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.020]   if you can mention?
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.900]   - In the West Bank?
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.260]   - In the West Bank, Ramallah, Jenin, Bethlehem,
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.260]   Lebron, Jericho, Nablus.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.100]   They have their own stories,
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.740]   they have their own histories.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.860]   - Yeah, and it's fascinating also
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.260]   how interconnected they are, you know,
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.260]   like a friend of mine, Mona Omari,
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.500]   recently did a documentary report
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.620]   on the day that Haifa fell during the Zionist invasion.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.620]   The Haganah led the Palestinian residents of Haifa
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.460]   down to the city center.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.580]   And as absurd as it sounds,
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.540]   those of them who stood on the right side of the street
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.900]   were forced into cars that took them to multiple stops
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.740]   that would later become multiple refugee camps,
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.620]   the last of which was Jenin refugee camp.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.380]   And those who stood on the left side of the street
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.460]   were forced to board boats that took them to Lebanon
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.820]   to become refugees there.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.260]   Last month, we saw the Israeli army invade Jenin
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:37.100]   in maybe the largest military invasion of Jenin since 2002.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:42.660]   And they killed many people,
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.340]   they attacked medics and journalists
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.780]   in broad daylight on camera,
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.380]   they have destroyed infrastructure
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.620]   and it was all very painful,
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:54.700]   but I think the most compelling aspect
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.300]   of the raid on Jenin was what followed.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.700]   Israeli soldiers at night held their megaphones
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:06.700]   and instructed hundreds of Palestinians
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.380]   to flee their homes.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.940]   And they told them, if you don't leave,
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.220]   if you don't have your hand up in the air,
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.580]   you will get shot.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.460]   And they were forced to leave their homes in the camp
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.820]   and walk to God knows where.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.980]   I can guarantee you, because the Nakba is not that old,
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.860]   I can guarantee you that some people
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.740]   who were marching away from their camps,
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.820]   who were chased away from their homes in the camp in Jenin,
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.740]   were some of the same people
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.580]   who were chased away from their homes in Haifa
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.100]   in the first place.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:40.100]   This perpetual exile that Palestinian people
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.460]   continue to live is unbearable.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.420]   I mean, in my case, my grandmother was removed
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.660]   from her home in Haifa in '48,
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:49.980]   and then she moved from city to city.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.900]   And then in 2009, she saw half of her home
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.020]   taken over by Israeli soldiers.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.540]   My grandmother died in 2020,
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.800]   and two months later, we got the next expulsion order
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.980]   from the Israeli court.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:06.580]   I'm quite ashamed to admit that I was relieved
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.620]   that my grandmother had died,
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:12.420]   because I did not want her, 103 years old at the time,
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.740]   to go through yet another Nakba.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.540]   And this is the fact for so many Palestinians,
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.540]   regardless of where they are on the map.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.940]   - If I may read the description of the situation in Jenin,
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.380]   and maybe you can comment.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.100]   So this is on July 3rd, 4th, and 5th,
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.260]   just reading Washington Post's description.
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.460]   So this was an Israeli military incursion to Jenin.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.680]   The raid included more than 1,000 soldiers
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.180]   backed by drone strikes,
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.060]   making it Israel's largest such operation in the West Bank
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.380]   since the end of the second Palestinian uprising in 2005.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.700]   The Israeli military said it dismantled
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:52.500]   hundreds of explosive, cleared hundreds of weapons,
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.480]   destroyed underground hideouts,
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.080]   and confiscated hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.700]   in, quote, terror funds.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.980]   Many of the 50 Palestinians who have attacked Israelis
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.540]   since the start of the year
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.060]   have come from Jenin camp and the surrounding area.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.980]   Palestinian attacks inside Israel
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.980]   have killed 24 people this year.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.020]   UN experts describe the Jenin operation
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.300]   as collective punishment, in quotes,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.660]   for the Palestinian people,
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:23.740]   amounting to egregious violations of international law.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.800]   Many of the more than 150 Palestinians
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.480]   killed by Israelis this year
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.480]   have also come from these communities.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.800]   Palestinian fighters say they need arms
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.800]   to defend themselves against the Israeli occupation
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.000]   and military incursions into the camp,
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.800]   during which Palestinian civilians,
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.900]   including children, have been killed.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.340]   So those are the,
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:49.000]   I would say, different perspectives
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   on the many people on both sides who have been killed,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.500]   many more Palestinians.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.840]   - Can you comment more about the situation?
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.480]   - I mean, I think the Washington Post article
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   is a little bit more careful than other media
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.180]   that came out recently about Jenin.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.320]   I think, you know, I was listening to a Reuters radio show
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.460]   and they failed to ever mention the occupation.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.400]   I don't even think this paragraph mentioned
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.920]   that Jenin is under occupation
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.540]   by the Israeli forces, by the Israeli regime.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.600]   I think this is the most important piece of context
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.160]   that gets obsecured in our media reporting,
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.800]   is these cities, these refugee camps,
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.000]   are under illegal occupation.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.800]   The Israeli army has no business
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.580]   being there in the first place.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.260]   That is the departure point.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.900]   That is the most important piece of context
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.480]   that will answer to you
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.760]   why these people are arming themselves,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.660]   many of which, by the way, lived through the 2002 massacre
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.920]   and bombardment of Jenin and grew up in that violence.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.000]   The context that Palestine is under occupation,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.360]   that these Palestinian cities are under occupation,
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.980]   that they have to deal with land seizures at all times,
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.980]   that they cannot leave their towns without a special permit,
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.620]   all of this will give context to the violence.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.940]   And, you know, the thousands of Israeli soldiers
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.800]   that raided the camp that day,
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.800]   that traumatized an entire generation,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.920]   they think they will quell that generation.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.800]   They think that with such bloodshed
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.600]   and such barbaric violence,
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.800]   destroying infrastructure, attacking medics,
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.960]   killing people left and right,
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.820]   they think with this kind of terror
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.200]   that they can quell people,
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.400]   tell people that they can guarantee
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.920]   that these kids are not gonna grow up and resist.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.960]   But that's the opposite of what happens.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.140]   One thing about Palestinian people,
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.420]   they will not compromise their dignity.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:02.620]   These people live in dire, excruciating circumstances,
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:10.160]   and it is so courageous, in my opinion,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.980]   that they even think to defend themselves
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.420]   against one of the most lethal,
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.580]   one of the most sophisticated armies in the world,
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.100]   against a nuclear state that can wipe them out
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.620]   in a matter of seconds.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:24.660]   But it's not, at the end of the day,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.160]   it's not even about courage.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.580]   It's about survival.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.460]   They don't do this because, you know,
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.020]   of machismo or because of heroic tendencies.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.960]   It's because this is about survival.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:40.220]   - So the degree there's violence, it's about survival.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.780]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.160]   I think if there was no occupation,
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.980]   there would be no violence.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.860]   It's quite obvious.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.120]   And again, people understand this.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.980]   I mean, like we saw on Twitter in the recent month,
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.700]   all of these Israeli propagandists
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.940]   who had tweeted pictures of little girls
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.540]   with guns in Ukraine and women making bombs in Ukraine
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.940]   and young men carrying their rifles in Ukraine
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.660]   and praising them as heroes,
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.420]   post very similar pictures of Palestinians
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:13.100]   and calling them terrorists.
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.220]   It's glaring, the double standard.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.380]   I don't even need to linger on it.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.740]   - Well, the double standard is glaring,
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.940]   but I also think the glorification of violence
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.820]   is questionable.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.540]   There's a balance to be struck, of course.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.380]   But...
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:34.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't think we should be glorifying
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.580]   violence at all, but I don't think
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.620]   we should be normalizing violence either.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:44.180]   I think that's what it is.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.220]   You know, I'll tell you a story.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.940]   I was interviewing a person whose brother was killed
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.620]   by the Israeli military during a Israeli raid
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:56.680]   on their village, and the person was so concerned
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.100]   about whether I was gonna report that
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:07.980]   her brother allegedly had a Molotov cocktail in his hand.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:13.340]   And I found it absolutely insane, absolutely absurd
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.700]   that we can just glance over the fact that there is,
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.700]   again, a foreign military in tanks
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.380]   with rifles and snipers invading the village
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.060]   at 4 a.m. in the morning,
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.020]   shooting live ammunition at people's houses,
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:29.860]   throwing tear gas.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.540]   That we can just glance over, it's normal.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.020]   We could just report on it.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:36.100]   No problem, nobody's gonna bat an eyebrow.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:41.100]   But the fact that potentially somebody might have picked up
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.940]   a Molotov cocktail to throw it at this invading army
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.500]   is where we draw the line.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.660]   It says a lot.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.580]   It says a lot about whose violence is normalized,
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:56.580]   is accepted, is institutionalized, is glorified even.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.260]   You walk around Tel Aviv and you see all of the plaques
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.180]   plastered around the streets of the country,
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:07.800]   of the city, celebrating the battles that they had won,
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.780]   the massacres that they had enacted
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.100]   against the Palestinian people.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.820]   But God forbid, God forbid,
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.500]   Palestinians have any kind of similar sentiment.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.580]   - So on July 4th, during this intense period,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.500]   a Palestinian rammed a car into pedestrians
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.260]   at a bus stop in Tel Aviv,
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:33.220]   injuring eight people before being shot dead by a passerby.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.560]   Also that night, Hamas fired rockets into Israel
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.340]   and then Israel responded with strikes
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.540]   on what it said was an underground weapons site.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.100]   So just to give some context
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.540]   to the intense violence happening here,
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.720]   what do you think about Hamas firing rockets into Israel?
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.500]   - Well, the framing makes it seem as though
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.500]   like unprovoked Hamas is like firing rockets onto Israel,
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.420]   regardless of what you think of Hamas, obviously.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.160]   But unprovoked.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.380]   But that's not the case.
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.580]   The provogation is the fact that they are forced
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.060]   to live in a cage, that they have no access to clean water,
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.540]   they have no access to basic rights,
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:18.780]   no access to imports, no access to anything,
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.540]   that they can't leave.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.140]   They're living in a densely populated enclave
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.540]   that was deemed uninhabitable by the UN,
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.900]   that was deemed an open air prison.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:34.900]   So the rockets in any case are retaliation for the siege.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.860]   Let's start there.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.740]   But again, this is just to prove my point.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.180]   Violence begets violence.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.640]   Palestinian people are not violent people.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.660]   We are not violent people at the core.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.580]   And I think what serves this narrative is Islamophobia,
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.900]   is like xenophobia towards Arabs,
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.420]   which we don't have, like I don't have the luxury
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.540]   to like to write laws about.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.440]   By the way, I'm quite frustrated by this.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.340]   I am preoccupied and the Palestinian people are preoccupied
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.500]   with the material violence that we have to deal with
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.820]   on the day to day, the demolitions, the bombings,
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:14.940]   the imprisonment.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:19.620]   That's what we're distracted with and busy with
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.020]   that we can't even talk about the racism,
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.300]   the casual racism against us,
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.500]   the anti-Palestinian racism be it in the media,
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.100]   on social media, in diplomatic circles.
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.580]   But all of this racism that has gone unchecked,
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.860]   that has not been regulated for decades,
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:38.060]   allows for these tropes to continue
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.740]   in which Palestinians are promoted
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.500]   as these like barbaric terrorists.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.380]   And the only way we could remedy that situation
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.380]   is by marketing them as these like defenseless victims.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.780]   But the fact of the matter is not this simplistic.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.100]   Palestinian people are human beings
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.660]   who should enjoy a full spectrum of humanity,
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:05.580]   which includes rage, which includes disdain,
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.660]   which includes happiness and joy and laughter,
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.860]   which includes celebration,
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.860]   which includes all of these things,
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.300]   but we're not allowed this.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.700]   But we are doing exactly what any people throughout history
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.100]   who have been oppressed, who have been colonized,
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.220]   who have been occupied, have done and continue to do
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.860]   as we see in Ukraine, which is celebrated by mainstream media.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.740]   I'm sorry to keep reiterating this point,
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:34.740]   but at this point, I am quite exhausted
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:44.340]   by how exceptional Palestine and Palestinian resistance is
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.980]   when the world tells me time and time again
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.660]   that it doesn't have a problem with violence,
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.780]   it just has a problem with who does that violence.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:56.780]   - Do you in your mind and the way you see this region
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.100]   draw a distinction between the people in power
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.220]   versus the regular people?
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.220]   So you mentioned the Palestinian people.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:08.420]   Is there something you can comment on Hamas and the PLO?
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.780]   Do you see them as fundamentally different from the people?
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.860]   What does Hamas do well?
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.180]   Where do they fall short?
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:22.980]   - I think governments, wherever globally,
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.500]   are different from people.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.780]   No government is a true reflection of its people.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:31.780]   I think this is even true in the case of like Arab countries
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.860]   that normalize with Israel.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:38.660]   In many of the cases, they're unelected governments.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.460]   I think the Palestinian Authority continues to fail.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:46.420]   I think there are subcontractors of the Israeli regime
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.580]   through their security coordination.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:52.300]   And also, I'd like to use this as an opportunity
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.980]   to comment a little bit on the analogy thing,
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.140]   not to stray away from the question.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:04.620]   But the Palestinian Authority, two years ago,
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:08.580]   killed an opposition activist named Nizar Bennett.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.700]   It was a horrendous crime.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:15.220]   And I was in Ramallah with the people protesting
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:18.020]   against the Palestinian Authority.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.100]   And at some point, they had their batons,
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.420]   the Palestinian Authority police, and they beat us with it.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.380]   And many of the people in the crowd
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.540]   were liking the Palestinian Authority to Zionism.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:31.460]   I think people, this is what people do
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.780]   when they are confronted by a great evil.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.180]   They liken it to some other great evil.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.300]   And this is where the Hitler analogy came from.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.460]   Again, I don't think it's like the best strategy
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.860]   moving forward, but I refuse to be criminalized
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.140]   for a little sentence.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.460]   - But to linger on those in power,
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.340]   one of the criticisms towards Hamas and PLO,
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.740]   towards the Israeli government,
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.460]   at least the current coalition government,
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:08.420]   is that there's a lot of incentive
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.420]   to sort of perpetuate violence to maintain power.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.540]   There's a hunger for power and maintaining that power
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.660]   amongst the powerful.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.420]   That's the way power works.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:25.420]   So is there a worry you have about those in power
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:29.060]   not having the best interests of its people?
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.340]   So those in power, the PLO, Hamas,
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:38.580]   not being incentivized towards peace, towards justice.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.900]   - You know, looking at the PA's action today,
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.060]   it tells you a great deal about what they're interested in
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.900]   and what they're not interested in.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.020]   And maybe, yeah, the occupation is in their best interest.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:57.140]   And you can infer similar things looking at Hamas,
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:02.380]   but these two entities virtually have no power, even Hamas.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:10.740]   Yani, there is the context that Hamas is permitted
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:15.620]   by international law to use armed resistance, blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:19.220]   Does that mean Hamas is like equipped to govern Gaza?
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.060]   I don't think so.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.660]   Does that mean that people around Palestine
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   necessarily want to live under Hamas rule?
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:33.220]   In 2006, Hamas was democratically elected.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.420]   I don't know if that's still the case today.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.660]   There's a lot to be said,
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.820]   but neither of these entities have any real power
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:44.260]   in perpetuating.
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:49.260]   They don't, the only body that has access
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.860]   that can flip the switch on all of this equation
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.220]   is Israelis.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.540]   They're the ones who are keeping people in a cage.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.540]   They're the ones who are wrapping the West Bank with a wall.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.140]   Everything else to me is just secondary,
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.860]   regardless of what I think personally
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.260]   of any of those people.
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:12.820]   I know personally for me, the world I envision,
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.300]   not just Palestine, the world I envision
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.060]   is a world that goes beyond states,
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:22.060]   that goes beyond this framing of power,
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:27.060]   this hierarchy in which some people rule over other people.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.940]   This whole idea of nation states,
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.940]   be it Israel or any other nation states,
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.300]   it's futile, it's not good, it's exclusive.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.860]   I think that we can achieve a better world than that.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.620]   - Well, how do you do a better world?
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.460]   Actually, if you just linger on that,
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:49.300]   politically speaking, geopolitically,
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.900]   you have to have representation of the people,
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.940]   you have to have laws,
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.580]   and you have to have leaders and governing bodies
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.860]   that enact those laws and all those kinds of things.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.860]   You probably need to have militaries to protect the people.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.740]   - Can you not imagine a world without militaries?
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.540]   - I can imagine it, but we're not in that world.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.860]   - Yeah, I'm not saying, you know,
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.980]   I have all the answers or a PowerPoint in my pocket,
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.220]   you know, with the instructions,
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.900]   but I'm saying the world I'd like to live in
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.980]   is one that transcends borders,
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.980]   is one that, you know, does not necessitate militaries,
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:30.180]   that doesn't necessitate all of these prisons,
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:35.180]   all of these walls, all of these racist laws.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.420]   - So you don't think violence is a fundamental part
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.660]   of human nature that emerges
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.620]   and combined with a hunger for power?
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.660]   - I do think that both of these things
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:51.540]   are truly intrinsic to human beings,
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:55.020]   but I also do think there is a way to move beyond them.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.740]   I'm not saying I have the answers.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.860]   I'm tempted to say sway, but.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:05.340]   - But you have a hope that there doesn't have to be war.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.420]   - Yeah, yeah. - In the world.
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   - Definitely, definitely.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.740]   - Well, if we look a little bit more short term,
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.660]   people speak about a one state solution
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:15.000]   and a two state solution.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.180]   What is your hope here for this part of the world?
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:23.420]   Do you see a possible future with a two state solution,
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.860]   whether it's with Palestine and Israel?
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.420]   Do you see a one state solution
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:32.420]   where there is a diversity of different peoples,
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.280]   like in the United States, and they have equal rights?
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:39.540]   In the courts and everywhere else?
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.100]   - You know, I don't think there's a geography
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.580]   in which a two state solution is possible.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.620]   As we said earlier, Swiss cheese,
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.320]   there's literally settlements all over the West Bank.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.620]   And I don't think it's fair.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.580]   A two state solution is fair to all of the people
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:01.140]   whose homes are still in Haifa,
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.020]   in Nazareth, in Jaffa, and so forth.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.580]   And I don't think it's fair that I'm gonna have to
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:11.140]   travel to another country to visit my cousin
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.040]   who's married in Nazareth, for example.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.540]   And beyond that, it's just not possible.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.300]   I do believe that whatever you wanna call it,
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.260]   one state, two state, 48 states, 29 states,
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.660]   whatever you wanna call it, refugees need to return,
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.940]   land needs to be given back,
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.900]   wealth needs to be redistributed,
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:36.700]   and a recognition of the Nakba needs to happen.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.800]   That is the only way we could move forward.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.300]   And you know, regarding whether this is like
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:49.300]   a possible situation for two people to live side by side,
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.180]   let's ask two questions.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:58.260]   Let's say you lived in a house with a person,
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.660]   your roommate, you just had a roommate
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.940]   who constantly beat the shit out of you.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.900]   I wonder if you'd wanna continue to live with them.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.220]   That's one.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.460]   And let's try another scenario.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.500]   Let's say you live in a house with a roommate
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.880]   who you just absolutely hate,
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.860]   just absolutely oppose their existence as a people.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:23.820]   You don't even give him a key to your apartment.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:28.340]   Let's say now you're like equal partners in the apartment.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:30.860]   Would you wanna live with him?
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:31.740]   I don't know, we'll see.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.660]   We'll see, time will tell, but you know,
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:36.740]   I don't think they wanna live with us.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.340]   Israelis are quite good, you know,
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.540]   especially Israeli diplomats,
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.540]   they're quite good at using flowery language
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.260]   about peace and coexistence and so on and so forth.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.500]   And they're good with making us seem insane or radical
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.500]   or like full of hate and so on and so forth.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.780]   But the policies speak for themselves.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.740]   The actions on the ground speak for themselves.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.760]   And I truly, I mean, every time there's an uptick,
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.540]   many of them leave and I wonder, I would like to see,
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.980]   I wonder what would happen in a one state solution.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.680]   - Well, okay, so you've spoken eloquently
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.420]   about the injustice of the evictions,
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.280]   the demolitions, the settlements.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.500]   But is there, can you comment about the difficulty
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.140]   of the security from an Israel perspective
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.260]   when there is a large number of people
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.920]   that want to destroy it?
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.580]   How does Israel exist peacefully?
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.420]   This one state solution.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.940]   - I don't know, by not shooting, you know,
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.700]   a journalist doing her job in the Zanine refugee camp.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.060]   - But that doesn't-- - Why not killing
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.820]   a 14 year old standing in his front yard?
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.500]   This whole talk about, you know, security and security fence
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.260]   and the whole like propaganda of the Israeli defense forces
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.220]   and this whole iron wall ideology
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.860]   in which somehow they are always defending themselves,
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.100]   even though they're, you know,
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.540]   Netanyahu and the Israeli government continue to talk
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.780]   about an existential threat,
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.700]   about Iran being an existential threat.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.820]   Even though the Israeli government is the only body
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.820]   that holds nuclear weapons in the region.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.060]   They're the most sophisticated army in the region.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.500]   And yet they continue hiding behind their fingers
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.260]   and talking about an existential threat
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.580]   and talking about how like they're insecure
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.460]   and so on and so forth.
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.660]   I came here on the bus, you know,
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:42.740]   I live in a house where everybody in the world
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.180]   can easily Google it and get its address.
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.620]   And anybody can just walk into my house.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.440]   And this is just, and I'm lucky and privileged
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.000]   as a Palestinian journalist.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.380]   There are many Palestinian journalists who lose their lives.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.460]   This is like, that's real insecurity,
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.700]   but we don't even have time to whine about it
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.220]   because there's real shit going on on the ground
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.820]   that we're preoccupied with and reporting on all the time
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.100]   that we don't even have the time to talk about
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.100]   how limited is our institutional backing,
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:16.780]   how limited is our, you know, cyber security,
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:19.380]   how limited is our, you know, even healthcare,
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.340]   you know, like all of these things.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.880]   We don't even have time to complain about.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.280]   But the real life things that formulate
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.200]   an insecure population that Israel certainly
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.040]   does not suffer from.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.720]   - There's a tension here.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.080]   It's true that the ideas of existential threats
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.920]   to a nation have been used to expand
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.520]   the military industrial complex
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.920]   and to limit the rights of its people.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.620]   So in the United States after 9/11,
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:56.100]   Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded under some justification
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.460]   of there being terror in the world, these big ideas.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.660]   And in the same way, yes, Israel,
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:06.120]   with the existential threat of Iran is used to expand
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.500]   its military might over the region
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.060]   and control over the region.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.660]   But it also has some truth to it
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.700]   in terms of the threat that Israel is facing,
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.280]   including from Iran.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.360]   If Iran were to get a nuclear weapon,
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.640]   do you think there's a threat from that?
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.960]   - But who has the nukes?
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.800]   - Right now.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.460]   - Yeah, but like we're talking about this far away monster
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.760]   that's like we're scared of, you know,
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.880]   it's like fear mongering.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.360]   What do you mean?
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.400]   Who has the nukes?
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.260]   - Some of it is fear mongering, but some of it is true.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:43.600]   - I don't think it's true.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.440]   I don't think it's true.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.360]   I think Israelis are obsessed with genocide
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.440]   because they have enacted genocide against us.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.240]   Even when we talk about like a future,
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.160]   a liberation of Palestine,
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:56.680]   when we're talking about anything,
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.360]   they constantly jump to saying things like,
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.720]   "Oh, they wanna throw us into the sea.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.280]   "They wanna kill all Jews."
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:07.240]   What kind of hyperbolic bullshit is that
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.120]   to say that if I am chanting and marching for my home,
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.200]   not to be taken away from me by some kind of settler court,
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.160]   I am somehow demanding the murder
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.480]   of all Jews across the world.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.920]   That is hyperbolic.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.240]   And the fact that we coddle it is insane to me.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.420]   So no, I don't think as things stand right now,
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.080]   as the power balance stands right now,
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.160]   I don't think there's an existential threat to Israel.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.800]   And also let's redefine what existential threat.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.240]   Do we think Israel,
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.040]   the Israeli regime, the Zionist regime
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.920]   should continue to exist in its forms,
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.200]   subjugating people, enacting the crime of apartheid
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.320]   according to a bajillion human rights organizations?
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.680]   Do we think that it should continue
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.120]   keeping people in a cage?
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.000]   If that's what people are fighting to save,
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   then that says a lot about the people
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.720]   who are feeling this existential threat, not me.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.800]   - Do your beliefs represent the Palestinian people?
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.480]   Meaning how many people are there that want
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.480]   Israel to be gone?
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.640]   But what does it mean for Israel to be gone?
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:16.160]   - What it means is for people who think of Israel
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.160]   as an occupier who stole land,
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.200]   that needs to go away, that this should be all Palestine.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.640]   - Yeah, but is that a bad thing for these borders to be,
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:27.080]   like for the occupation to end,
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.640]   for the land to be given back, is that a bad thing?
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.560]   - Well, there's different definitions of occupation.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.280]   There's people in their homes now, right?
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.400]   - But is it their home?
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.440]   I'm not talking about,
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.160]   like some random home,
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.680]   but there are many, many, many, many, many, many,
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:50.280]   many, many, many, many, many, many, many Israelis
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.080]   who drink their coffee every morning
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.060]   from living rooms that are not theirs.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:00.840]   - That are not theirs, that were taken
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.320]   just a few decades ago.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.400]   - Yeah, where like the owners,
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.600]   the rightful owners of these homes
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.360]   are still lingering in refugee camps,
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.180]   are still dreaming of return.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.280]   - There are homes on the land of Israel
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.200]   that you wouldn't classify as stolen.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.560]   - I mean, there is, like if it wasn't stolen,
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:25.560]   like if it was built, but is the land stolen, right?
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.680]   But all of this, again, I try not to like fall into this
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.000]   because it just like, it feels so abstract and far away,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.560]   and this is not how liberation is gonna look like whatsoever
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.360]   and I'm not like, I'm not fixated on ethnic cleansing.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.960]   That is not, I'm not obsessed with ethnic cleansing.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.800]   I'm obsessed with ending the ethnic cleansing campaign
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.000]   that has been visited upon me and my family
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.560]   and my community for seven plus decades.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.280]   That's what I'm obsessed with.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.240]   All of this other stuff about what happens to the settlers
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.920]   and like, you know, we wanna kill all Jews
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.280]   and all of this, I think it's bullshit
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.160]   and I think it's ridiculous and I think, you know,
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.400]   fixating on it is like distracting from the focal point.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.800]   There needs to be an end to all of the injustices,
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.600]   to all of the atrocities.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.240]   You know, a little boy from Jerusalem
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.400]   should be able to go jog around the city
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.040]   without fearing getting shot.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.400]   That's like the simplest thing we're asking for here
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.720]   and we want our land back.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.280]   And those things do not mean actually at all
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.240]   the ethnic cleansing of another people.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.280]   - Well, but that, we should be precise here.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   So a little boy being able to run around Jerusalem,
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.160]   that's a great vision, not just safely,
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.040]   but without racism, without hate.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.800]   That's a beautiful vision, yes.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.240]   But people in West Jerusalem,
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.360]   people in Tel Aviv that have homes,
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.200]   should they stay there?
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.920]   Do they have the right to stay there?
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.360]   That's like maybe number 99 on my priorities list.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.800]   I'm concerned with the refugees,
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.960]   I'm concerned with the teenagers in the prisons,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.520]   I am concerned with my house,
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.880]   I'm concerned with my family's house in Haifa,
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.160]   I'm concerned, there's a lot for me to do
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   before I can even tend to the needs of my occupier.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.440]   That is the least of my concerns.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.080]   - So you want the low-hanging fruit,
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.320]   the obvious injustices to end.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.920]   - Yeah.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.480]   - But still, the long-term vision
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:42.120]   of existential survival of Israel,
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.040]   which is the concern of its government,
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.760]   is the concern of its people.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.760]   Do you see a future where Israelis have a home in the region?
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.640]   - Sure, just not in my front yard.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.040]   - Which, where's the front yard,
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040]   and where's the back yard?
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.600]   - There are literally Jewish settlers,
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.280]   one of which from Long Island, in my literal front yard.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.240]   And this is the case in hundreds,
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.560]   if not thousands of Palestinian homes.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.920]   You know, no one is saying Jewish people shouldn't exist
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.320]   or they shouldn't have a state of their own.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.800]   I mean, I think all religious-based states
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.840]   are a bad idea, all nation states are a bad idea,
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.800]   but whatever, if that's what they wanna do,
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.280]   that's what they wanna do.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.920]   But that doesn't mean that they are allowed
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:32.400]   or have a right to create and implement
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.280]   a system of Jewish supremacy at my expense.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.640]   That's not a crazy thing to say.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.320]   That is not a controversial thing to say.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.440]   You can have your state, just don't kill anyone.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.640]   Thank you, have a good day.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.920]   You know, like, that's not a crazy thought to have.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:53.880]   - And seek and establish a symmetry of power in the courts,
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.520]   which is the current source of injustice.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.600]   - I mean, that's when it comes to like force expulsions
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.360]   in our home, but there's a myriad of other ways.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.320]   - Through the military?
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.160]   - The military, I mean, the police.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.880]   If you look at like how many times,
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.520]   I should have brought the data with me,
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.840]   but if you look at how little times the Israeli military
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.880]   or police has like investigated its own people
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.080]   or indicted its own people.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.080]   I mean, just recently, the killer who has been hailed a hero
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.760]   by some of Israeli society who killed a Palestinian man
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.400]   who is autistic, who lives inside the occupied old city,
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.400]   where again, Israeli military has no business being there
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.160]   or jurisdiction whatsoever.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.960]   He was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.040]   who was trigger happy because again,
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.800]   they have this like siege mentality
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.040]   where like any moving object is gonna kill them.
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.080]   And he was shot and killed.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.320]   And despite it being in broad daylight,
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.200]   despite it being well-documented,
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.760]   despite the victim being disabled,
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.240]   despite all of this, he was acquitted by the Israeli court.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.000]   The military, the courts, the government,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.320]   they all work together, which is why it's so ironic to me
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.640]   that there are hundreds of thousands of people
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.760]   marching on the streets of Tel Aviv,
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.440]   trying to save the progressive beacon
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.600]   that is the Israeli Supreme Court
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.440]   when you find its fingerprints all over the injustices
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.240]   perpetuated against Palestinians,
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:28.240]   be it legalizing and upholding the withholding
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.040]   of slain Palestinian bodies
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.560]   who were killed by the Israeli military
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.520]   to be used as bargaining chips with Israeli militaries,
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:40.400]   be it making decisions to dispossess entire villages
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.400]   like Amr al-Hiran, be it never once granting release
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.920]   to any Palestinian who was held in administrative detention
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.600]   without charge or trial,
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.760]   be it upholding the legality
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.080]   of the family reunification law
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.920]   that does not allow Palestinian couples
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.920]   who hold different legal statuses
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.160]   of reuniting and living together as families.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.360]   I mean, those are just some of the few things
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.920]   I can think of about the Israeli Supreme Court.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.840]   So the real tension that exists
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.840]   is the lack of diversity on the Israeli political spectrum
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.760]   that makes the vision for a future so limited
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:28.880]   because those on what seems to be like the far left
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:35.120]   are defending an extremely conservative institution
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.360]   that is the Supreme Court
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.120]   that they regard as progressive
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.600]   when in fact it is the opposite of such.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.000]   So what do we do?
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   How can we talk?
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   How can we have peace with people
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.160]   who are chanting to save the very body
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.080]   that is displacing us?
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.440]   It's ridiculous.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.840]   - What's your vision?
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.640]   Let's just take it as a microcosm of Jerusalem.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.240]   What's your vision for Jerusalem looks like
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.600]   with a peaceful coexistence of people?
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:09.800]   - You know, as it looked like
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:14.280]   before the Israeli state emerged,
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:17.520]   I mean, we should be reading our history here.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.640]   When you read like European and white historians,
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:24.840]   they'll tell you like Palestine was barren.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.240]   Many of them would say like it was even without a people.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.160]   There were nobody, nobody was there
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.160]   or like some of them will say we were uncivilized.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.840]   But the fact of the matter is Palestine,
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.040]   Jerusalem particularly had a diversity of religion,
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.400]   Druze, Jewish people.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.960]   You know, my grandmother continues to talk about,
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.680]   well, she continued until she died.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.760]   She continued to talk about her Jewish neighbors
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.280]   when she grew up in the old city
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.720]   or like when she was born in the old city
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.400]   and then her Jewish neighbors in Haifa.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.680]   We even had one Jewish member of our family,
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:03.480]   M. Sammi actually, who just also recently passed away.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.640]   Like Druze were a part of Palestine
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.360]   and they spoke Hebrew, a different kind of Hebrew,
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.280]   but they spoke Hebrew and they were,
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.680]   people really need to read "The Hundred Years War on Palestine".
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.760]   It's really an excellent synopsis of the history.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.720]   But this whole idea that this is like some kind of war
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.760]   between two religions is so misleading
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:26.840]   because what's happening is a bunch of,
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.560]   frankly, European settlers
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.840]   with a certain political secular ideology
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.760]   came and relocated here
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.080]   and turned it into a religious conflict
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.440]   between people who have lived harmoniously together
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.960]   for decades before that.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.960]   And the whole idea, be it like Christian Zionism
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.440]   or John Hagee or like the calls for Jews
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.360]   to leave the United States and relocate in Israel
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:57.360]   or like recently, which we've heard about a long time ago,
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.400]   but recently an Israeli historian confirmed
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:06.720]   the fact that Israeli organizations were bombing Baghdad
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:09.760]   and bombing synagogues in Baghdad in Iraq
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.920]   to get Iraqi Jews to leave and come relocate in Israel.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.560]   All of this is manufactured.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.360]   And again, none of this is a conspiracy theory.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:21.680]   I know it sounds absurd and anytime I look at my life
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.920]   from a bird's eye view, I think, what a circus.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.480]   But it's real and it's verifiable.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.400]   Call the fact checkers.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.760]   - You mentioned the land registry.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.880]   Can you elaborate what's happening there?
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.720]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:40.720]   So our small victory in the Israeli courts
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:45.240]   was that they would keep us in our homes
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:47.680]   until a land registry is completed.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.880]   Basically, it means that they have to check
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.080]   who owned the land prior.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.840]   And then they could decide if the land is ours
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:01.240]   or the land belongs to the Israeli settler organizations
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.120]   that are headquartered in the United States
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.560]   and enjoy a tax exempt status here.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:10.000]   And that sounds great on the surface,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.480]   but then you look at Israeli law,
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.640]   you look at the Israeli courts, you look at ownership
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.320]   and you see that, oh, Israelis refuse to authenticate
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.640]   or take into consideration any land ownership documents
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.400]   from the prior of the establishment of the state.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.240]   So all of us in Jerusalem who have their taboo papers,
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.800]   their ownership papers from the Ottoman era,
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.480]   that's not legit in the eyes of the Israeli court
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.440]   because that existed before,
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.800]   like your ownership deeds existed
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.680]   long before Israel even existed.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.920]   So we're not gonna take this into consideration.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.600]   So not to be cynical here,
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.600]   but unfortunately the likely result of the land registry
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.520]   is that they're gonna say,
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.680]   oh, all of this land belongs to these Jewish organizations
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.760]   because they're not gonna take
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.160]   any of our documents into consideration.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.520]   But that means that there's going to be another campaign
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.960]   and there's gonna be a long-winded fight
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.840]   and we'll see what happens.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.320]   But that's the fear and there's a huge dreadful fear
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.400]   of a massive loss in property in Jerusalem
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.960]   following this land registry
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.200]   for the reasons I just told you.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.600]   It's the mere fact that they just refuse
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.400]   to look at land ownership documents.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.160]   - What is the process of the fighting this
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.280]   in the courts look like?
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.240]   If you can maybe just comment on it.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.280]   So there's--
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.160]   - I always make a joke that being in an Israeli court
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.000]   is like playing a game of broken telephone
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.600]   because everybody's speaking in Hebrew
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.440]   and then your lawyer says something to your dad
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.320]   and your dad says something to your mom
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.880]   and your mom whispers it in your ear
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.240]   and then you say it to your cousin
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.160]   and your cousin has a completely different idea
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.960]   of the verdict than what the verdict is.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.280]   But that's really the reality.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.840]   - So a lot of the fights happen family by family?
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.680]   - No, it's like groups.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.400]   So in our case, it's like four houses, every four houses.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.880]   But again, it happens in a language we do not speak.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:01.200]   And a lot of the time, our strategy is buying time
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.000]   and building a global campaign.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.640]   Like we know that there is no recourse
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.000]   in the Israeli courts.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.280]   I mean, my grandmother used to say,
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.360]   and this is like a popular proverb,
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.880]   if your enemy is the judge, to whom do you complain?
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.960]   - So to the whom you complain
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.080]   is maybe the international community.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.960]   - Yeah, I mean, in our case,
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.240]   it was the international community,
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.080]   but in our case also,
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.720]   it wasn't just the international community.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:32.040]   It was the hundreds of thousands of people in Palestine
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.280]   and abroad who were marching on the streets,
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.000]   getting beaten and brutalized in Jerusalem.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.520]   And I don't know, sometimes arrested in places like Germany
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.680]   and so on and so forth,
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.000]   who forced themselves inside the media cycle.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.600]   This was what was unique about Sheikh Jarrah.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.120]   We were able to penetrate an industry
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.520]   that usually ignores us
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.800]   and usually refuses to use any of our framing,
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.440]   any of our quotations.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.240]   And these people that marched,
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.040]   these people that spread the rhetoric,
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.240]   spread the facts, wrote articles,
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.600]   these people that made videos online and got arrested,
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.240]   and many of whom are still in Israeli prisons
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.760]   paying higher prices than I have ever paid.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.400]   These people are the ones that truly moved
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   the international community into action.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.560]   It wouldn't have.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.120]   The United States, I don't think, would have said anything
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.760]   had it not been for the immense media pressure
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.480]   that was created from the immense popular pressure.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.160]   There are a lot of moving parts to a global campaign,
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.880]   and I think it's so impressive, you know,
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.160]   that we were able to do this without any media backing,
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.440]   without any institutional backing,
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.560]   without any training, without any budget, nothing.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.400]   - You mentioned the United States.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.840]   What's the role of the United States
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.960]   in the struggle that you've been describing?
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.000]   What's the positive, what's the negative?
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:55.760]   - The role is perpetuating what's happening, Yanni.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.040]   It's all a negative role, to be honest.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.680]   - With the money, with power?
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.680]   - Yeah, it's like the 3.8 billion in military aid every year.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.360]   It's the standing ovation.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.080]   - Israel is the largest recipient of US foreign aid
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.120]   since World War II.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:17.120]   To date, the United States has provided Israel $158 billion.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.640]   As you said, it's providing currently 3.8 billion
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.000]   every year.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.040]   A lot of people raise the question of what's the interest
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.320]   of taxpaying American citizens in this kind of--
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.680]   - Yeah, zero interest.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.040]   - Foreign aid.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.320]   - Zero interest.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.200]   I don't think Americans, I think Americans,
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.920]   a lot of Americans are concerned with healthcare.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.600]   A lot of Americans are concerned with clean water in Flint.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.960]   I don't think they're concerned with funding apartheid
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.200]   in another country, and I think it's a disturbing phenomenon
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.160]   that although public opinion in the United States
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.160]   is shifting, I would argue drastically about Palestine.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.840]   People in Washington are yet to catch up.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.240]   It was only, I think, nine Congress people
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.240]   who boycotted Herzog's speech in Congress yesterday,
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.760]   and he received standing ovation after standing ovation
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.520]   after standing ovation after standing ovation,
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:17.520]   and I wonder if the everyday American is concerned
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.520]   that many of their politicians are Israel First politicians
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.520]   or politicians who care more about maintaining
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.800]   a relationship with the Israeli regime
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.840]   than they care about their own districts.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.880]   - You've tweeted that 49 years ago, Ghassan Khanifani,
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.720]   well, you can maybe correct me on the pronunciation,
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.080]   was assassinated.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.240]   You wrote, quote, "His revolutionary articulations
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.720]   "of the Palestinian plight for liberation
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.360]   "shook the colonial regime, yet he's not dead.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.920]   "His ideas remain ever timely and teachable,"
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.880]   and you also tweeted an excerpt from his writing,
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.280]   "Between 1936 and 1939,
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.880]   "the Palestinian revolutionary movement
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.640]   "suffered a severe setback
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.920]   "at the hands of three separate enemies
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.280]   "that were to constitute together the principal threat
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.560]   "to the nationalist movement in Palestine
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.160]   "in all subsequent stages of its struggle.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.040]   "One, the local reactionary leadership.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.880]   "Two, the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine,
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.120]   "and three, the imperialist Zionist enemy."
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.360]   Can you analyze what he means by those three things?
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.280]   The local reactionary leadership,
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.000]   the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.320]   and the imperialist Zionist enemy.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320]   And also, could you comment on him as a person?
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.120]   - Yeah, I mean, Ghassan Khanifani is a brilliant,
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.600]   brilliant, brilliant writer, and he was prolific.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.440]   He's authored so much books,
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.560]   even though he was assassinated in the '70s,
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.600]   but he was 37, if I'm not mistaken,
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.360]   35 when he was assassinated.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:57.360]   He was an inspiration to me in school,
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:02.360]   and I remember even my teachers had qualms about him
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:04.880]   because he was a secular person.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.680]   But I love Ghassan Khanifani.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.080]   He's a beloved figure in the Palestinian community,
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:13.960]   and I hope to one day be able to achieve a fraction
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.560]   of what he's achieved in the terms of shaping
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.400]   a political consciousness for Palestinians
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.760]   and for people in the region.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.520]   - Did he classify himself as a politician,
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.720]   as a philosopher, as an activist?
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.560]   Do you know?
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.680]   - He was a writer, but he was also part
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.600]   of the Palestine Liberation Front, PFLP.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.600]   - So he used the words to fight for freedom.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.840]   - Yeah, I don't think he would have thought
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.800]   his words were divorced from other forms of struggle,
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.960]   but I think he recognized the importance of culture
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:51.920]   and shaping culture and shaping public opinion,
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.840]   both in achieving a shift in global stance
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:05.400]   and also in achieving an awakening
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:08.720]   in the Palestinian generation as well.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.440]   - There's a very famous interview of his
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.840]   where he's talking to, I believe, a British journalist,
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.160]   and the British journalist is asking him,
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:20.920]   "Why don't you have talks with the Israelis?"
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.920]   And he means, "What do you mean, talks?
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.960]   You mean capitulation?
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.640]   You mean talking that you can't have a conversation
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.240]   between the sword and the neck?"
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:34.360]   And I think that really summarizes the kind of values
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   he stood for.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.640]   Now to talk about the three things--
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.040]   local reactionary leadership, regimes in the Arab states
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.280]   surrounding Palestine, and the imperialist Zionist enemy.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.040]   - Yeah, so in today's terms,
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.920]   the local reactionary leadership
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.780]   is the Palestinian Authority.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.880]   The regional regimes we're talking about,
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.200]   actually, the normalization deals
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.680]   that have emerged in recent years,
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.920]   the Abrahamic Accords, have been talked about
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:08.360]   as though they're groundbreaking, new phenomenon.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:13.200]   But many Arab countries have normalized relations
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.400]   with the Israeli regime.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.420]   Since the birth of the state, it's not a new thing.
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:24.000]   But yes, I think he was talking about Egypt and Jordan
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.840]   at the time.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.560]   Today we can include United Arab Emirates,
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.060]   we can include Bahrain, we could include Morocco.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.920]   And again, these Abrahamic Accords,
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:40.240]   they are promoted and marketed and talked about
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:44.680]   as some kind of religious reconciliation,
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.280]   which I think is the most disgusting thing ever,
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.120]   because they're not about religious reconciliation.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.680]   They're about arms deals and economic deals,
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.760]   and they're about consolidating power in the region.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.420]   They're about mutual strategic interests
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:02.720]   that all of these nations have together.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.920]   And some people argue that Palestine
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.300]   is no longer an Arab cause
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:10.940]   because Arab countries are normalizing.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:13.160]   But most of these governments, if not all,
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.600]   actually, all these governments that have normalized,
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:20.000]   most of them are monarchies, are not elected governments,
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.200]   and they do not represent the will of the people
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.560]   or the desires or the opinions of their peoples.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:32.560]   And the proof to this is places like Jordan and Egypt,
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.080]   even though they've normalized
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.460]   and had peace agreements with Israel
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:37.760]   for many, many, many, many years,
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.240]   Palestine and the Palestinian cause
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.140]   was still a talking point in the political campaigning
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.000]   of politicians, of Jordanian Egyptian politicians,
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.680]   and continues to be, for them to gain popularity,
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:52.140]   because that's where the hearts of the people are.
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:57.860]   And then the Zionist regime is quite explanatory,
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.120]   the imperial Zionist regime.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.200]   I mean, what else do you call a regime
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:04.560]   that sought help from imperialist powers
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.440]   to depopulate an entire country
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.040]   and build a new one on top of it?
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.200]   - So mostly you would say the thing
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.400]   that Abraham Accords achieved
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:20.400]   is a negative thing for Palestine.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.080]   So these kinds of agreements amongst the powers,
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.520]   between the leadership is not,
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.480]   yeah, it's not positive for the region.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.000]   No, no.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.880]   Obviously they're gonna be marketed as positive,
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:39.880]   and obviously they're gonna have this flowery language
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:43.320]   surrounding them, and the idiots in the room
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.800]   might nod and smile,
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.680]   but anybody with critical thinking skills
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.640]   can know that if people continue to be under occupation,
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.400]   there's nothing positive there.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:53.800]   And it's also there's,
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:56.560]   let's linger a little bit on the mutual interests.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.080]   The only way Morocco could normalize relations
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.280]   with the Israeli regime
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.920]   is so that the Israeli regime
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:08.200]   could recognize Moroccan sovereignty
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.160]   over the Western Sahara,
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.840]   which just happened actually last week,
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.800]   and now Morocco, and before that,
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.560]   Morocco recognized Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:21.240]   It's not like Morocco itself just has no interest
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.440]   in this kind of deal.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.720]   - You mentioned that you hope of accomplishing
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.280]   some of the things that Hassan Khanifani
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.960]   was able to accomplish.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.520]   Let me ask you a silly question,
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.040]   perhaps a silly question.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.600]   Do you have interest in running for political office
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:45.200]   into leadership?
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.640]   I hear laughter in the room,
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:51.840]   to lead in a leadership position in Palestine?
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.320]   - Not currently, no.
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.960]   (Lex laughing)
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.800]   Not at all.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.800]   - Let's see if this ages well.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.160]   - I don't think, yeah, no.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.960]   I don't think there's a body through which
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.640]   I can run for anything.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.240]   It's completely dysfunctional.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.680]   And also, I don't wanna wear a suit all the time.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.520]   - Who would wanna do that?
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:20.080]   So from which kind of pedestal,
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.000]   or from which kind of stage
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]   do you think you can be most effective?
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.680]   - I was born and raised in Jerusalem.
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:28.600]   I speak perfect Arabic.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.960]   I think my Arabic writing is much superior
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.800]   to my English writing,
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.720]   but I choose to
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.720]   write in English because
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.800]   I think there's a disparity,
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.080]   and there's a chasm between what is said in Arabic
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.960]   on the street in Palestine,
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.480]   and what is said here about Palestinians,
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.520]   both by anti-Palestinian racists
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.760]   and people who are pro-Palestine
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.760]   and advocates for Palestine.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.520]   And I believe I and a few others from my generations,
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.280]   or many others actually from my generation
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.240]   are working to fill that chasm.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.440]   And I also believe that literature, culture,
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.960]   the public sphere,
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.200]   changing the public opinion,
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:13.400]   changing the narrative is important
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.640]   to affecting policy, to affecting change,
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.040]   affecting material change.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.840]   I'm not gonna go read a poem
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:23.760]   in front of a checkpoint and watch it catch in flames.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:28.080]   I'm not that delusional about the power of words.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.280]   But I do think that
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.720]   I have a responsibility,
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.800]   and I have a privilege even to have a voice,
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.680]   to have some kind of platform.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:41.640]   And if I'm not defining myself,
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.360]   if I'm not talking and representing myself,
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.840]   then other people will define me.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.920]   And their definitions of the Palestinian people
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.520]   across the few past decades
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:55.240]   have not been kind or generous to the Palestinian people.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.080]   That's one thing.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.840]   The other thing is I believe in the United States
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.400]   as a front for change.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.880]   I believe we have a lot more leverage here
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:05.840]   than we do back home.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.160]   Again, I believe in,
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.680]   someone said the other day,
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:11.520]   I can't remember their name,
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.720]   but someone said, "No stone unturned."
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:15.960]   I believe in fighting on all fronts.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.320]   But here really, I can go protest
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:21.360]   in front of the Israeli embassy without getting shot.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.760]   There's a lot of work to be done here.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.040]   There's a lot of people waking up.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.600]   I would even argue that a reckoning is coming
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.440]   in the American public.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:35.280]   And more and more American people are concerned
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.560]   where their tax money is going,
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.400]   are concerned what their politicians are invested in.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.440]   More and more American people are saying not on our dime,
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:46.080]   are saying not, you know,
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.240]   not today, not here.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.840]   And also there's many Palestinians in the diaspora
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.040]   here in the United States and Europe
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.040]   who benefit and could benefit from political education
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.080]   in the English language.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.800]   Because of the diaspora across history,
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.520]   the Palestinian diaspora has been effective
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.320]   in the '70s and the '80s.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.720]   And I'm hoping ever since 2021,
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:14.040]   there has been a resurgence of the power
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.040]   and influence of the Palestinian diaspora.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:18.920]   - To ask another silly question,
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:21.520]   since you mentioned the United States,
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.920]   I don't know if you follow the politics
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:23.760]   in the United States,
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:28.600]   but do you have a preference of presidential candidates
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.500]   in the 2024 election?
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:34.680]   Or is that, do you follow--
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.520]   - I do follow.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.880]   - Where each candidate stands on the different policies?
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.280]   - I do, I think everybody in the world
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.680]   should be able to vote for American elections, actually.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:43.640]   (laughing)
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:44.600]   I do follow.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:45.640]   - Because of the influence they have.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:46.680]   - Yes, yes.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:47.520]   - Yeah.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:52.600]   - I do follow, I don't have a preference whatsoever.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:55.280]   I don't.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:58.040]   I saw Cornel West on CNN.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:01.120]   I don't think, I don't know if he's gonna go far
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.360]   with his campaign.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.480]   Cornel West is running with the Green Party.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.320]   And I don't think he's gonna achieve much success,
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:11.120]   but I saw him on CNN berating Andrew Cooper,
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:12.880]   and I enjoyed that very much.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:15.040]   Wouldn't mind seeing that on my screen.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:15.860]   - Regularly.
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:20.220]   - Regularly, but don't really have an opinion about,
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:21.380]   you know.
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:23.860]   - You wrote Rivka, a book of poetry.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:24.900]   How did that come about?
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:29.900]   Maybe you can tell the story of that book coming to be.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:34.680]   - You know, I signed the book when I had a lot less
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:37.500]   visibility in the world.
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:41.340]   So when I didn't think thousands and thousands
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:42.720]   and thousands of people would be reading it,
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.740]   I decided to include many poems which I wrote
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.980]   when I was young.
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:49.220]   Because it's a long, it's a long,
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.100]   it's a long journey, this book.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:55.300]   It starts in Jerusalem, it goes to Atlanta,
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:58.540]   it goes back to Jerusalem, and then it ends in New York.
[01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:01.460]   And Rivka is the name of my grandmother.
[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:04.660]   And it's an Arabic name, a Hebrew name,
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.460]   and it means to accompany someone.
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:10.500]   And I wanted to write about displacement
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:15.380]   in a way that was beyond what we read about in English.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:17.600]   Poetry as a medium, I don't know if I have much faith
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.020]   in it anymore, to be honest.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.180]   Maybe like I'm turned off by it,
[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:24.220]   and I'll revisit it again in a few years.
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:27.740]   But at the time of writing this book, Poetry as a Medium,
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:32.740]   it really was a source of hope and inspiration for me.
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:38.220]   So my mother was a poet, and she would,
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.300]   you know, her and my dad would play this game in the morning
[01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:43.220]   she would read her poems to him,
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:47.420]   and he would guess which lines would be red penciled
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:48.660]   by the Israeli military censor,
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:49.980]   because she would submit her poems
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:52.460]   to the local newspaper, Al-Quds newspaper,
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.780]   and you know, the military censor has to go over it.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:58.780]   And you know, she would get her poems back
[01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:01.260]   with a bunch of words erased, and they would laugh about it,
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:02.740]   and blah, blah, blah, so poetry was very much
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.980]   part of my upbringing.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:07.020]   And you know, as a Palestinian,
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:08.900]   when you're excluded from mainstream spaces,
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.580]   including media and journalism,
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:13.740]   poetry tends to be a place where you can say
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.780]   what you want to say without repercussions,
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:18.940]   and I say that, I realize that, our greatest.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:25.620]   Writer Ghassan Kanafani literally had his car bombed,
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.420]   exploded because of his writings,
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.140]   and you know, recently, Darin Tatur,
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:32.300]   a Palestinian poet with an Israeli citizenship,
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.140]   was imprisoned for a few months
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.420]   for publishing a poem on Facebook
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:38.140]   in which he said, "Resist, my people, resist."
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:39.980]   So even that is not necessarily true.
[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:42.900]   But anyway, it just felt like I could,
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.020]   it's a place where I could talk
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:49.020]   and express large ideas in a simplistic way.
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:52.260]   And you know, the best example I could give you
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.940]   is one of my favorite poets, Rosh Hud Hussain.
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:54:01.860]   When the Israeli authorities decided to do the land law,
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:08.620]   which classified, I believe, 93% of historic Palestine
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:14.380]   as Israeli-owned, state-owned, forgive me,
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:18.740]   and then when they also did the absentee property law,
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:20.980]   which allows the Israeli government
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.860]   to take over homes that were depopulated
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:25.260]   from the Palestinian owners,
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:28.740]   he wrote a poem called "God is a Refugee."
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.620]   It's kind of a sarcastic, sardonic poem
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:32.980]   in which he goes, you know,
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:34.780]   "God has become a refugee, sir,
[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:38.380]   "so confiscate even the carpet of the mosque
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:41.380]   "and sell the church 'cause it's his property
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:44.340]   "and sell our orphans because their father is absent
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.460]   "and do whatever you want."
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:50.540]   It's a sarcastic poem that was in reaction to these laws
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.820]   that translated to the everyday Palestinian,
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.700]   to the farmers, to the landowners,
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:58.620]   what these bureaucratic, complicated laws meant to them,
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:00.340]   what they meant to their land,
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:05.340]   what it meant, what effect are these laws gonna have
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:07.180]   on these people's lands?
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:09.700]   And that, I think, is the role of poetry
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:12.660]   that I try to achieve.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:17.660]   - So poetry ultimately prizes the power of words,
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:22.380]   and so the medium, the power of the medium of poetry
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:25.660]   transfers nicely to any medium that celebrates words.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:29.780]   So even, I mean, just writing novels,
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:35.140]   tweeting, you're also working on a new book,
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:38.060]   a memoir, what's the title?
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.420]   What can you say about it?
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:43.580]   - Memoir is bizarre because, you know, I'm so young,
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:44.660]   so it's not really my memoir,
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:47.620]   but it's rather a memoir of the neighborhood
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:49.020]   which I grew up.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:51.700]   The title, the tentative title is A Million States in One,
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.660]   and it's a nod to how many different realities
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.160]   and universes exist in this tiny one country.
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.300]   And it's, you know, it's kind of,
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:06.660]   it's kind of a documentation of the two waves of expulsion
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:09.420]   in 2009 and 2020 and 2021,
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:13.060]   and the kind of behind the scenes of the campaign
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:15.860]   that took place, the diplomatic and media campaign
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:19.180]   and grassroots campaign that took place to save our homes.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:22.580]   And it's also an exploration of other communities
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:27.460]   that are threatened with expulsion
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:29.800]   and other communities who are resisting in their own way,
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.420]   be it in Beta, in Nablus, or South Herb on Hills,
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.420]   and in Masafariyatta, or in Silwan, or in the Naqab,
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.940]   all these communities that are dealing
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:40.820]   with different forms of expulsion.
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:43.660]   And, you know, the emphasis that I'm trying to achieve
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.500]   with this book is dignity.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:51.100]   I want to write a book about, you know,
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:57.220]   my experiences that is like super, that is super dignified,
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:00.580]   that kind of kicks its feet up on the table
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.220]   and says what it wants unabashedly,
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.980]   because, you know, we are told not only
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:06.220]   are we going to be victimized,
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:08.780]   but we are going to be polite in our suffering.
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:10.380]   And I want to reject that completely,
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.100]   and I want to lean into the humor
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:14.460]   of the past few years of my life,
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.300]   'cause I think that's really what the world needs
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:18.860]   and what I need to be writing.
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.180]   - A few questions here, but one of them is about humor.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:25.380]   In Rivka, you wrote, "My mother has always said
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:29.700]   "the most tragic of disasters is those that cause laughter."
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.460]   What do you think she meant by that?
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:34.140]   - Yeah, it's, I don't know if,
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:36.060]   I mean, that's my mom saying,
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:38.420]   but I don't know if it's like probably a proverb
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.580]   that I first heard from my mom,
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:42.200]   but it's (speaking in foreign language)
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.200]   Like, the most evil of atrocity is what makes you laugh.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:52.700]   And it can be, you know, it's open for interpretation.
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:55.820]   You should be aware of, one school of thought would say
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:57.900]   you should be wary of the things that make you laugh,
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:00.540]   but another school of thought would say
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:01.860]   this is a commentary on, like,
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:05.140]   our natural reactions to tragedies, right?
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.460]   In, like, 2012, 2011, something like this,
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:13.460]   we had, like, a protest, and after the protest,
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   all of the women of the neighborhood
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:19.300]   were sitting down under the fig tree of our neighborhood,
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.740]   which they always do, and, you know,
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:24.500]   a bunch of soldiers, maybe 40 soldiers,
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.380]   started marching down the street,
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:28.940]   and everybody dispersed and hid in their homes.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:31.540]   But my aunt, who has now passed away,
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:33.180]   my aunt refused to go home.
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:35.940]   She wanted to gather her teacups,
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.100]   because she really cared about her teacups.
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:41.380]   So I was begging her to go inside,
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.140]   and she refused, she was gathering her teacups.
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:48.140]   So a soldier, you know, grabbed me and squeezed me
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:51.420]   between his baton and an electricity pole,
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:53.860]   and it was very excruciatingly painful
[01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.060]   and traumatizing for me as a child,
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:59:00.420]   but it was, it's also, like, a funny memory, in a way,
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:05.420]   despite the pain, despite the trauma that came with it.
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:07.900]   There's still something funny about it.
[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:08.860]   - The absurdity of it.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.500]   - Yeah, and it's, like, it's dignifying
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.260]   to find humor in these kinds of things.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:15.620]   It makes you realize you are not so weak,
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:17.220]   you are not so powerless.
[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:19.260]   Another thing is, you know, my same aunt,
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:22.500]   who was, like, super obsessed with cleanliness,
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:27.500]   would, you know, insist on not going to sleep
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:31.780]   before washing the dishes.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:32.940]   And I would always tease her and say,
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:33.940]   "What, you're just gonna, like,
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.420]   "you're gonna give them the house clean?
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:38.380]   "Like, you can leave it dirty so they have to clean it up."
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:39.980]   And these little things, although, like,
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:44.260]   incredibly, you know, absurd and telling of a harrowing
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.700]   reality that our family and many in the neighborhood
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:51.220]   were living, are also the coping mechanisms
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:55.540]   that we were using to deal with our everyday reality.
[01:59:55.540 --> 02:00:01.260]   And so much in the public framing of Palestinians,
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.700]   be it in media and novels and diplomacy
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:07.580]   and so on and so forth, is that of the powerless victim,
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:09.860]   is that of the person who only weeps.
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:12.900]   You know, like, Israeli propagandists, for example,
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:17.020]   will, like, show pictures on Twitter of, like,
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:19.980]   a house in Gaza, and they'll be like,
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.060]   "Look, this house has windows."
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:24.180]   Like, they're talking about their BCs,
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.820]   but they have a nice, they have a balcony on their house.
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:28.940]   What are they talking about, like, you know?
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:31.340]   Or, like, they'll show a video of a supermarket in Gaza,
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:32.580]   and they'll be like, "How come they're talking
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:34.420]   "about a blockade when they have a supermarket?"
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:37.380]   And blah, blah, blah, as though, you know,
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:39.620]   the ceiling has been so lowered
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:42.540]   that we can't even afford joy anymore,
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:45.300]   or, you know, a little supermarket in the neighborhood.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.980]   - So, as a poet, as a writer,
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:50.220]   I've written a book of poetry,
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:51.540]   but now working on a new book.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:56.460]   What can you say about your process of crafting words?
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.500]   I think people listening to this can hear
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:01.940]   that there's a poetry to the way you speak in English.
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:06.940]   So, somebody that cares about the craftsmanship of words
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:08.980]   in both English and Arabic,
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:10.820]   what can you say about your process?
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:16.100]   - Oh, it's a lot more neat than, like, this conversation.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:18.700]   It's like I am obsessed with sentences,
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.300]   and it takes me a long time to, like,
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:23.140]   finish a piece of writing.
[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:24.700]   I am a perfectionist.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:25.620]   - Do you edit a lot?
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:27.340]   - I edit all the time, and I, like,
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:29.700]   can't move on from one sentence until it's perfect.
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:32.860]   But I will say my other writer friends here in New York
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:37.860]   do not face is how easily disrupted my writing is
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:41.420]   by other news.
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.060]   I'll pitch a story to my editor
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.940]   about something, for example,
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:50.220]   and then as I'm writing it, 20 minutes in,
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:52.780]   some kid was shot and killed by the Israeli military,
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:53.860]   so I have to say something about it.
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.260]   And then 30 minutes later, as I'm writing it,
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.660]   there's news about a home demolition in Silwan,
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:04.340]   and there is this relentless onslaught of news
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:08.500]   that prevents us and deprives us of the ability to analyze,
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:11.220]   to frame, to think, to conceptualize,
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:14.940]   to write beyond the current affairs.
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:19.020]   We're stuck in the relentlessness of the occupation
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:25.100]   that a lot of the time I worry that the things I'm writing
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:28.980]   are always in reaction to a crime that took place,
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:33.220]   to a bombing that took place, and so on and so forth.
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:35.380]   And I think that's unfortunately true
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:37.620]   for so many Palestinian writers.
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:42.380]   So, you know, I would say isolation
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:47.380]   and stepping away from the news is very important to do,
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:48.740]   but I don't do it.
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:50.220]   (Lex laughs)
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:55.220]   - Okay, so the struggle to find the timeless message in it
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:58.740]   is an ongoing struggle for you.
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:01.260]   - I mean, there is the timeless,
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:02.980]   it's not even timelessness, it's timeliness.
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:04.900]   I think what you write is always timely
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:07.060]   because the occupation is ongoing.
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:11.100]   But the struggle is, you know, moving beyond the news
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.220]   and tackling more nuances.
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.420]   Because in Arabic, I can.
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:18.060]   In Arabic, I can philosophize.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:20.220]   I can talk about violence,
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:23.420]   and I can talk about my complicated relationship
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.820]   with violence, or like my complicated,
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:28.340]   I can complicate and nuance and give things nuance.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:31.340]   But in English, people still do not believe
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.540]   we are under occupation,
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.620]   even though it is an internationally recognized fact
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:38.180]   that is broadcasted 24/7
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:41.100]   through the world's most watched screens.
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:44.940]   So we're stuck in like a practice
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:46.780]   of providing facts and figure as in,
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:49.900]   actually this happened, and this person did this,
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:53.300]   and according to international law, and blah, blah, blah.
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:56.180]   So we're stuck in this because the basic truths
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.540]   about our own existence are denied,
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:00.460]   that we don't even have the luxury
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:03.460]   of evolving our writing beyond it,
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:05.420]   or at least evolving my writing beyond it.
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:07.700]   And this is what I'm trying to do with this new book.
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:10.900]   - That's fascinating that in English,
[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:17.940]   your brain is more inclined to go towards activism,
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:19.820]   whereas in Arabic, you have the luxury
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:21.700]   to be more of a philosopher.
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:24.060]   - I wouldn't say activism, I would say journalism.
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:25.300]   - Journalism.
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:26.460]   - Just making sure, you know,
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.260]   like disrupting the flow of the sentence
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.500]   to insert a statistic,
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:35.340]   or insert a historical fact that should be implied.
[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:36.180]   - Yeah.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:37.260]   - And should be a household name,
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:42.220]   but it's not, you know, I can't just say the Nakba,
[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:45.340]   I have to say the Nakba, the 1948 total,
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.140]   near total destruction of Palestinian society
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.300]   at the hands of Zionist militias
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:50.100]   that later formed the Israeli military,
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:51.940]   that now terrorizes us today,
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:56.940]   and there is like three tier legal system, blah, blah, blah.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:58.620]   I can't just say the Nakba,
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:01.340]   I have to give all of these explanations.
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:04.900]   And that's heartbreaking,
[02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:06.620]   and people ought to do better,
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:08.940]   people ought to, you know, do better.
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:09.780]   This is not,
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:16.660]   it's not what my literature should be limited to.
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.660]   It's not what anybody's literature should be limited to.
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.700]   It's the job of,
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:22.740]   it's the job of, you know,
[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:25.620]   news reporters to report the news,
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.540]   but a lot of the time,
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:29.060]   they use looted language,
[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:31.060]   they use passive voice,
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:32.820]   they obfuscate facts,
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:37.700]   and it's on the shoulders of us, the heavy carrying.
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:41.460]   - Would you say that the press in the United States
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:46.420]   does a good or a poor job of covering Israel and Palestine?
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:48.220]   - Terrible job, horrible job.
[02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:49.540]   - What's the-- - Horrendous job.
[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:51.140]   They don't do their job whatsoever.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.700]   - What are the biggest failings?
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:55.780]   - Not mentioning that a town is occupied,
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:58.140]   when you're reporting about an occupied town,
[02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:02.380]   not mentioning that a settlement is illegal,
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:05.900]   or a settler is illegally present in a Palestinian village
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.420]   when you're reporting on them.
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:12.380]   Only quoting Israeli officials,
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:14.900]   and only quoting Israeli politicians and police officers,
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:19.020]   and framing your entire analysis with Israeli officials,
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:20.660]   and only interviewing Palestinians
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:25.660]   when they have been brutalized and victimized physically.
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.220]   Yeah, those are some of the issues.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:30.100]   There is plenty, and then like saying things,
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:35.100]   you know, like Israel will bomb a hospital in Gaza,
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:39.740]   and the press will say like Hamas run hospital,
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:41.900]   and this negative association with Hamas
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:44.660]   will remove any sympathy from the reader
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.140]   towards the victims of this hospital bombing.
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:50.980]   A lot of things, and a lot of them are sinister.
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:55.180]   I have many friends, many journalist friends,
[02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:57.300]   and I've seen many journalists online
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:00.780]   speak about their experiences when talking about Palestine,
[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.660]   the censorship that goes on into it.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.180]   And I have many journalist friends,
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.060]   some at the New York Times,
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:11.100]   some that used to be at the Washington Post,
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:14.020]   who tell me the kinds of battles they had to do,
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:15.700]   they had to go through with their editors
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:18.740]   to let them even utter the word Palestine.
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:21.260]   And not even in like news pieces,
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:25.260]   like pieces about, let's say, a Palestinian artist,
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:27.460]   or a Palestinian chef, or whatever.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:29.420]   You know, there's lots of,
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:32.140]   there's a lot that happens behind the scene
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:33.940]   that is not reported on.
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:35.580]   Because when it comes to Palestine,
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:40.580]   the rules and the laws of journalism are bendable.
[02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:42.700]   You know, passive voice is king,
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:46.420]   omitting facts is acceptable, anything goes.
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:49.860]   - So you personally, just psychologically,
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:54.020]   what have been the lowest points in your life,
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:55.380]   the darkest points?
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:58.980]   - A recent study came out and said
[02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:02.740]   that 52% of Palestinians have depression.
[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:05.620]   I would argue that the number is much, much, much higher.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.980]   I think it would be absurd for someone
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:10.460]   to live under the conditions we live under
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:15.460]   and not contemplate many things, many things.
[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:18.420]   Not just suicide, but many, many, many things.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:21.940]   And if people were to put themselves in our shoes
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:24.140]   for just one day, they would understand
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:29.780]   where all of the rage and all the resistance is coming from.
[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:32.700]   It's not an easy life.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.420]   - So where do you find the strength?
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.620]   - I'm surrounded by good people.
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:41.380]   And I'm surrounded by good people,
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.020]   and I don't even think of it as a strength.
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:44.460]   I think of this as my obligation.
[02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:46.660]   It just feels like the thing I have to do.
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:49.140]   It's not, I don't need inspiration,
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:51.140]   I don't need strength, I don't need,
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:54.260]   it's just my obligation.
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:58.380]   It's just, there is a great travesty
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:08:59.820]   taking place in the world.
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:06.940]   And I and few others have been put in a place
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:11.260]   where we're able to talk about it to a few more people.
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:14.460]   And it's just my obligation, I have to do it.
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.860]   - What gives you hope about the future of Palestine?
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:20.420]   - What gives me hope about the future of Palestine
[02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:23.060]   is taking a look at history
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:24.700]   and understanding that across history,
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:29.700]   there has not been an injustice that lingered endlessly.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:33.140]   Everything comes to an end.
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:34.740]   It's not necessarily, there's not necessarily
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:37.740]   like a perfect resolution for everything,
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:42.740]   but nothing continues in the form that it started in,
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:47.460]   in the occupation and colonialism in Palestine and Zionism.
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:51.340]   All of these things are not at all sustainable whatsoever.
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:52.700]   So taking a look at history,
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:54.980]   a lot of what I'm saying today
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:56.500]   and what I have said in your podcast,
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:59.460]   many people would be pearl clutching
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.300]   hearing me say what I say.
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:04.620]   But I always try to remind myself that during Jim Crow,
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.620]   during slavery, during the Holocaust,
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:10.940]   during the occupation of Algeria,
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:16.500]   during any point of colonialism
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:17.940]   in the African continent,
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:21.340]   people did not possess the moral clarity
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:23.660]   they possess today when they talk about these things.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:27.220]   And all of these things were contested and controversial
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:29.940]   and in many, many, many cases legal.
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.980]   And today they are deplorable, condemnable,
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:34.580]   and people say never again and they don't remember them.
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.300]   So that's what gives me hope,
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:38.180]   is believing in the, you know,
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:43.080]   believing in the inevitability of justice.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:46.060]   - What do you love most about Palestine?
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:48.420]   What are like maybe little things
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:50.020]   that you remember from your childhood,
[02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:53.940]   from your life there in Jerusalem and elsewhere
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:57.020]   that you just, brings a smile to your face?
[02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:02.940]   - I think just the unabashedness of Palestinians.
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:05.940]   We are people who are told,
[02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:09.420]   and at some point we're told by the large majority
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:10.980]   of the world that we should shrink ourselves,
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:12.480]   that we should be ashamed of who we are,
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:13.980]   that we are monsters, that we are terrorists,
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:15.420]   that we are blah, blah, blah.
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:19.300]   And Palestinian people don't really give a shit.
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:21.260]   You know, they're continuing to live as they do.
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:23.220]   They continue to resist, they continue to write,
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:26.340]   they continue to do all that they do
[02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:28.020]   and I love that the most.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:32.080]   And I love our ability to laugh more than anything else.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:36.920]   One thing that's misunderstood in American culture
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.500]   about Palestinian culture, or just Western culture in general
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:41.200]   is like martyrdom culture.
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:47.100]   A lot of the time people will broadcast images
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:51.660]   of Palestinian women cheering
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:56.660]   when their sons have been killed by the Israeli forces
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:12:00.100]   and they will say, you know, these people glorify death
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:02.540]   and these people are eager to like have sex
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:05.620]   with the 70 virgins in heaven and so on and so forth.
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:07.140]   But that's not the case.
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:09.580]   The whole idea of the occupation,
[02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:10.800]   when they are killing our children,
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.700]   the whole idea is that they're trying to break our spirits.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:17.620]   So these mothers whose hearts are broken, who are anguished,
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.420]   who are, you know, so,
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:27.440]   so, in so much pain, when they are cheering,
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.940]   they are not celebrating, they're not cheering,
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:31.940]   they are letting the occupier know
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:34.360]   that you have not broken my spirit.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.700]   I have not yet been defeated.
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.060]   And I think that is beautiful.
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:40.580]   It's the same thing with our prison culture.
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:42.820]   You know, Palestinians are fascinating
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:45.300]   in the sense that Palestinians go to prison
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:48.420]   and they study and they come out with degrees.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:53.040]   They can find ways to participate in civil society.
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.020]   They can even smuggle, you know, sperm from prison
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:58.420]   to give a life outside of it.
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:01.300]   Because they understand in their philosophy of prisons,
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:03.080]   they understand that these structures,
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.580]   these buildings were built to break your spirits.
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:07.460]   So what do you do?
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:10.460]   You allow it, you don't allow it to break your spirits.
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:14.320]   You resist it, you continue to hold on to life.
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:16.700]   You continue to hold on to your love of life.
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:19.840]   You continue to hold on to your love of freedom.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:20.940]   And you come out of prison
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:22.940]   and you're celebrated by your community.
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:26.280]   And the prison has not broken your spirit.
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:29.140]   So all of these structures and system
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:31.780]   that the Zionist movement has put into place,
[02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:33.980]   be it the shoot to kill policies or the prisons
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:35.660]   or the demolishing our homes
[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:40.060]   that were meant to kill our spirits, they don't.
[02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:42.540]   You demolish a home in Jerusalem
[02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:45.140]   and the people say, "Don't worry, we'll build another."
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.000]   And you demolish it and we'll build another.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.060]   That's what I admire most about the Palestinian people,
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.560]   is this resilience.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:52.220]   And you know, people love to say resilience,
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:53.300]   but I think it's stubbornness.
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.660]   I think we're such a stubborn people
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:56.120]   and I think that's great.
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.860]   - Well, Mohamed, thank you for being a man
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:03.880]   who exemplifies this unbreakable spirit.
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.060]   Thank you for the words you've written,
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:09.620]   the words you've spoken, and thank you for talking today.
[02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:12.980]   This is an honor and this is, thank you for educating me.
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:14.660]   - Thank you so much.
[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:16.060]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
