[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of that great third
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.920]   chapter of the book of Genesis which I read just now and especially to verses 7 and 8,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.800]   the seventh and eighth verses in the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.120]   And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.760]   fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.800]   And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.600]   And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.200]   of the garden.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.320]   Now I have read this great chapter for the third Sunday evening here in succession, and
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.240]   we are considering it together for the third time.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.360]   And I do so for the reasons that I have been giving.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.520]   Here is a chapter which is absolutely vital and essential to a true understanding of the
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.160]   message of the entire Bible.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.880]   We meet together here in the Christian church, obviously, to consider the message of the
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880]   Bible.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.240]   That is the business of the Christian church, to expound and to proclaim the message of
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   this book.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.160]   It is not a philosophical society.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.720]   It is not a cultural society.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   It is not interested in anything primarily except in the propagation of this particular
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.960]   message.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   That is why meeting a service such as this, of course, is quite unique.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.320]   All services thus held in the name of Christ are unique in that sense, that we start by
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.220]   making the claim that we come from God, with a message from God.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.840]   We don't start with ourselves.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.960]   We are not in an effort and in an endeavor to arrive at God or at anything else.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.280]   We come to consider a message from God, God speaking.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.000]   Now that is, I say, the whole purpose of a service such as this.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.160]   And there is a great message in this book, a message for men as he is at this moment.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.520]   Not something far away from life and divorced from life, but the most practical message
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.000]   in the world.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.840]   This book has been speaking to generation after generation, speaking to them exactly
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.200]   where they were and as they were, and that is precisely what it does still.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.600]   It is not some theoretical question or interest.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.960]   There are such subjects and they have their place, their importance, and their right.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.720]   But this isn't that, because this book tells us all along that we are passing through this
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.880]   world once, but that while we are passing through this world, we are determining at
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.040]   the same time our eternal and everlasting future.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.120]   And that therefore this is the most vital and the most urgent matter that we can ever
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   consider together.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.280]   So all along it presents its truth to us.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.800]   In this way it reminds us that we must do something about it.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.480]   It's always impressing the urgency of the position upon us.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.360]   If you're interested in the technical terms, it presents its truth always in an existential
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   manner.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.520]   I mean by that, as the term means, that I can't afford to sit back and consider it
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   casually and in a detached manner.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   No, no.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.760]   The Bible says you can't afford to do that, because you're in an uncertain world and
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.160]   your whole life in it and your tenure of life in it is so uncertain.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.640]   It's urgent.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.360]   And therefore it always appeals to us to give it such an attention.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.880]   It's here, I say, to deal with the problems that confront us every once.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.720]   It's here to talk to us about ourselves.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.560]   This very word we are considering tonight reminds us of that, you see.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.400]   The Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where art thou?"
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.080]   You remember that that is the account which is given here, a direct and a personal address.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.560]   And that is what is happening in this service.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.800]   God is speaking to us.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.700]   He is speaking to us individually.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.400]   He is speaking to us about ourselves, where we are, why we are there, how we've ever
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.560]   got there, how we can come from there.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.640]   That's its whole message.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.160]   In other words, its interest is in us, with our problems, our pains, our perplexities,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.840]   our troubles, and all the things that tend to make life so difficult.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   That's its message.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   Now, I'm just saying that if we really are to understand that message, we've got to
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.040]   understand the message of this third chapter of this book of Genesis.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.640]   Because this is foundational.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.680]   This is the chapter in which we are told exactly why things are as they are.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.720]   It's a book of history.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   This chapter is historical.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.400]   Now you say, "That's an assertion."
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   I agree.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   It is an assertion.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.380]   I can't prove it to you as you can prove a mathematical problem, but the greatest things
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.600]   in life cannot be proved in that sense.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.840]   I could suggest many things to you which you take for granted, which you know to be true,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.680]   but which you cannot prove in a mathematical sense.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.280]   The whole case of this book is that this is historical.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.640]   This is the explanation of why man is as he is.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.400]   But in addition to that, as I was indicating last Sunday evening, it's not only historical
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.360]   in a very remarkable manner, it also describes us one by one as we are now.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.160]   That is the extraordinary thing about men in sin.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.720]   We all of us, as it were, in addition to inheriting certain things, repeat what was done there
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   at the beginning by men.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.520]   Now last Sunday evening we were looking at that in a more or less intellectual manner
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   because man has fallen and gone astray in every respect.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.680]   He started doing so with his mind.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.800]   Man went wrong first of all in his mind.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.440]   And we were looking at that last Sunday evening.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.600]   You remember how he accepted the dogmatic statement and he began to look at it and to
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.480]   fumble it and he liked it.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.160]   And then he accepted what he was told about God's character and God's power in spite
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.520]   of all that God had done for him and he deliberately rebelled against God.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.160]   He accepted another point of view.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.360]   He accepted another theory.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.920]   He believed it was true.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.320]   He acted upon it and he began to reap the consequences.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.640]   And we were at pains to show how men is still doing that.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.320]   How he is ready to swallow the most dogmatic assertions which lack any vestige of proof
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:31.400]   whatsoever because they have great names attached to them and because they are made with a great
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.580]   spirit of dogmatism.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:43.520]   This is something that not only a Christian like myself points out about modern thinking.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.440]   Some of you no doubt heard recently a lecture on the wireless on the theme of what was called
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.560]   Humbug in Science.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   It was a most interesting address and perfectly true.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.680]   Humbug in Science.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.120]   Showing how people, even scientists, can mislead themselves in various ways and do so.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.500]   Well that is something I say that is universally true.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.600]   But it is particularly true in this realm.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:20.280]   Men still defy God and rebel against him merely on some theory or some dogmatic statement.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.320]   And then he repeats the whole sorry process.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.560]   He displays his doubts of God, his hatred of God.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.760]   He displays his ingratitude towards God.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.600]   He uses his own reason and substitutes it for divine revelation.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.560]   You remember how we are told, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.760]   and that it was pleasant to the eyes, she started using her own understanding and her
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   own reason.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.800]   And a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did each."
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.240]   Now that is the selfsame process you see.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.920]   It happened there at the beginning.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.640]   It is still being repeated.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.080]   But now I want to show you this evening that not only is this being done in the realm of
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.880]   intellect and understanding, it is being repeated in a much more experimental and even in a
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.400]   practical manner.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.440]   And here we have a perfect description of it.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.480]   What man in sin is constantly doing.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.600]   I confess again that I find it difficult at times, and where I am not to know that this
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.720]   biblical teaching about sin is true and how the God of this world blinds our minds, I
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.480]   be at a loss to understand it altogether.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.120]   I say, I find it difficult to understand how it is possible for anybody really to read
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.920]   this third chapter of Genesis and not at once to recognize this fact.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:55.200]   That there we have nothing but a perfect description and delineation of what has been true of every
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   one of us.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.760]   It is astounding to me that anybody can read that book and say, "Well now, that must
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.800]   be true because that is really exactly what I have been and what I have done."
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.400]   It is an account of me.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.280]   It is an account of men and women as I see them in the world today.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.040]   But of course instead of doing that, we try to avoid the facts and we try to explain them
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.720]   away in terms of psychology and in various other ways as I hope to indicate.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:30.560]   And so the voice of God and its message falls upon deaf ears and men and women immersed
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:38.680]   in sorrows and problems and trials and tribulations refuse the one thing that can deliver them
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.200]   and give them salvation.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.040]   That is the muddle that sin always leads to.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.600]   That is what happens to men when he refuses to listen to God and goes his own way.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.040]   He has brought himself into trouble, he even refuses the help which is offered to him to
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.920]   bring him out of it.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:04.480]   And so he goes on and on, turning round and round in circles and never reaching the point
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.600]   at which he would like to arrive at.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   Well now then, let me remind you of these facts.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:22.720]   Men in the way we have seen rebels against God and then certain consequences follow.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   What are they?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.440]   Well, here they are described as they happened at the beginning to Adam and Eve.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.800]   And as I describe them I think you will see that there is still an accurate description
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.680]   of what is still happening.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:43.280]   "And the moment they had eaten, the woman ate and then she gave also unto her husband
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.720]   and he did eat, and then at once.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:55.520]   And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:02.120]   And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons."
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   What does it mean?
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.520]   Well, you see the first thing that followed as a consequence from this act of rebellion
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.320]   and sin was this.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.080]   They at once became conscious of a loss.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.360]   Now here is a very interesting phrase here.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.800]   The eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   What does that mean?
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   Well, nobody knows exactly what it means.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.760]   But at any rate it suggests this, doesn't it?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.160]   That they were conscious at once that they were deprived of something that they had before.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.400]   They knew that they were naked before they were not naked.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   What is this?
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.960]   "I don't know," I say.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.720]   I am ready personally to agree with those who suggest as an exposition of this, that
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:56.800]   men at the beginning as he was made perfect by God, had a kind of glory even about his
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.080]   body.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.240]   There was a glory about his body even as there was about his soul.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.480]   For man when he fell, not only fell in his spirit, but he fell also in his body.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.840]   You remember how the Apostle Paul says that at the end when our Lord shall come he shall
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.000]   change this, our vile body, the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.120]   unto his glorious body, the body of his glorification.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.160]   Man was made in the image of God, let us remember, in every respect.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.600]   He was not only upright with a righteousness that was spiritual.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.120]   I believe there was a glory pertaining to the body of man.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.680]   And when he sinned he lost it.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.560]   And he was left with a body as we now know it.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.700]   And he was aware that he had been deprived of something.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.440]   There was a loss of something.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.360]   There was a consciousness immediately of a nakedness, of a loss, of an incompleteness.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:05.240]   Something had gone, a glory had departed.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:14.760]   And that I suggest to you is the simple truth about men ever since.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.840]   There is nothing more obvious about men as is in this world tonight than that every one
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:26.080]   of us has got this sense of loss.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.360]   Haven't we all got an idea that somehow or another we are missing something?
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:39.200]   We've all got an idea that there is something better, something higher.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.320]   We all know something about the longing for what a poet has called an "ampler ether"
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.680]   and a "diviner air."
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   You can't explain it away.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.760]   You've got it, everybody's got it.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.640]   Every man, it doesn't matter how far he's sunk in sin in an obvious external manner,
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.360]   every man's got this idea somehow that there is a better possibility, there is something
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   somewhere.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:13.520]   You see, that is why all these modern analyses of men which are not based upon this book
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.080]   are so shallow and so incomplete.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.560]   What's the meaning of this restlessness that's in human nature?
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.680]   What's the meaning of this searching constantly for something which we haven't got and which
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.520]   we don't seem to find?
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.520]   What's it all based upon?
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.320]   Well, there's only one adequate answer.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:40.720]   Man has got this innate feeling that he was meant for something bigger and something higher.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   What is it?
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.840]   Well, I'll tell you what it is.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   There is in every one of us a recollection, a memory of what we once were.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.880]   We were all in Adam.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.960]   Man was made perfect in the image of God.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.360]   I say he was upright, he was righteous.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.040]   There was this glory about his very body.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.880]   And though we've lost it and though we've never known it, a memory lingers.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.400]   It's in the whole of human nature.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.640]   It's in all mankind.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.880]   A sense of something else.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.640]   Of course, people have tried to interpret this in other ways, and they've gone wrong
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.080]   in doing so.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.760]   Plato, you remember, tried to explain it.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.120]   And Wordsworth borrowed his idea.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:35.160]   "Trailing clouds of glory do we come from God who is our home," says Wordsworth.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.720]   That's how we come.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.460]   He believed, you see, that we start in this world with the glory still, but then shades
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.280]   of the prison house begin to close upon the growing bough.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.520]   And somehow he's lost it.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.600]   No, no, he'd lost it long before that.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.320]   He'd lost it before he came.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.720]   But the memory remains, and the Platonic idea is simply an attempt to explain it somehow.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.600]   This recollection, this sense that man has got within him, that he was meant for something
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:10.000]   bigger and higher, there's a sense of being deprived of something.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.760]   I say it is universal.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:24.840]   We've all got this idea that we were meant for happiness, that we were meant for peace,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:33.840]   that we were meant for a life of joy, but that somehow this has been taken from us.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:42.720]   And thus I say man is ever restless, ever ill at ease, finds it difficult to live with
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.160]   himself and finds it difficult to live with others.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:56.680]   The whole of the human race is aware of this particular sense.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:03.080]   Now there I say at the very beginning, we are given this extraordinary description of
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   that, if you like, in a pictorial form, but true nevertheless.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.880]   And this has come down the centuries and persists even until this very night.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.640]   Shall I put that in a personal form before I pass on to my second question?
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:27.120]   Aren't you aware of this sense of loss, this sense of incompleteness?
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.880]   Is there not some kind of surging within your being, something within you that is crying
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:39.400]   out, I say, for something bigger, for something greater?
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.720]   Man cannot believe finally that he was just made to die.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.360]   He has a sense of destiny, a sense of bigness, a sense of glory.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.880]   He can't get rid of it, he can't get away from it.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.600]   He would have us believe at times that it can be explained in terms of some great evolutionary
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:08.680]   urge, the "el anvita" that is in us all, that's urging us on to some kind of perfection.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:15.240]   But that rarely doesn't explain it, because what we are all conscious of is the sense
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:20.280]   of having lost something, a memory, a recollection.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.600]   We are ever trying to recapture something that we know we once possessed.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.680]   Now that's the first thing, but let me hurry on to the second, because it follows of necessity
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.000]   from the first and very logically.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.400]   The second thing we are told about them is that having become aware of this loss, they
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.320]   then tried to deal with it.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.240]   They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.320]   You see, at once they were aware of this, and they felt, "Well, now something must
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.880]   be done about this, we can't remain like this.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.480]   How can we cover over this thing that we've lost?"
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:03.680]   So they did what we are told here, and thus they made their effort and their attempt to
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   cover themselves.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.160]   The later part of the chapter tells us, you remember, how utterly inadequate it was, and
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.120]   how God made provision for them.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:21.400]   But the point at the moment is that they themselves immediately tried to deal with it.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.000]   What a wonderful chapter this is.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.840]   Don't you begin to see how essential it is to a true understanding of life, had it
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.480]   ever occurred to you that in that one phrase you've got a complete epitome of the whole
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.960]   history of civilization?
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.920]   What's man been doing in his supposed civilization?
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:45.880]   He's simply been sewing together fig leaves to hide his own nakedness.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:52.280]   That is precisely the meaning of what we call civilization.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.480]   These are some of the ways which man has tried in order to do this.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.880]   He has always tried to do it along cultural lines.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.480]   He says, "Yes, what we've lost, of course, is knowledge.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.240]   There must be some understanding somewhere.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.360]   Life is an enigma, life's a problem.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.680]   Things seem to be contradictory, man himself is contradictory.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.640]   Now we're aware of all that at the very beginning, that's the loss.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.720]   But then we say, "Well, now, we must get out of this, we must discover this, we must
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.320]   cover over this."
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.880]   So we begin to resort to our various cultural ideas.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.520]   Knowledge, the thirst for knowledge, the thirst for understanding.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.280]   The book of Job describes it, how man has always been seeking for it.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.600]   It's more precious than rubies.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.600]   That's the thing.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   Seek wisdom, seek knowledge.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.520]   You get it in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   That's man under the sun, that's man apart from his relationship to God.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.000]   And there he is trying to understand.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.960]   He's seeking it in wisdom.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.760]   He says, "If only I could understand man, understand myself, the workings of my very
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.400]   being and of my mind, the cosmos in which I find myself."
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.040]   That's what is called philosophy.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   What's it trying to do?
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.200]   Well, it's trying to make up this loss, this failure to understand.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.760]   We feel we ought to know, that if we only strive we shall know.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.240]   They're trying to cover up the nakedness in respect of knowledge.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.560]   And not only, of course, direct knowledge like that.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.360]   Man in all his cultural activities is trying to do the same thing.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.080]   Not only in pure thought and philosophy, in his study of history, he's rarely trying
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   to do the same thing.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.200]   He's trying to arrive at this understanding.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.360]   In his love of the arts, in his cultivation of music and all these things, he's somehow
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.880]   got the feeling that if he only goes in for these things he'll make himself complete.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.040]   That he'll become entire again.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.840]   That's the thing, he's lost something.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.080]   How can he get it back?
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:01.720]   Well, these are the things that are going to bring in the covering and add to my completion.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.820]   I needn't keep you, you're familiar with it all.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.120]   The world is tremendously busy tonight in that respect.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.240]   Trying to cover up its nakedness.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.000]   Trying if you like to get back again the glory that's been lost.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.280]   Other ways, of course, in which he's done it have been political.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.480]   Those who view men as being essentially an economic unit, or just a social unit, they've
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.840]   followed it out along that particular line.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.960]   Man has always believed and still believes that somehow or another by means of legislation
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.120]   he can put things right.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.440]   All these deficiencies that we're aware of, all these lacks, well he says let's get together
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.080]   and let's organize this thing.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.040]   That's politics, that's political action.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.960]   That's the philosophy of politics.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   It's the attempt, I say, to put together the fig leaves once more to cover over a nakedness.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:03.120]   To make life whole and complete and rounded and so deal with this sense that we have of
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.840]   being deprived of something.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.520]   We feel we are entitled to a fullness and to a kind of rotundity in life and very well
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.360]   we'll go in for it in this way.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.880]   But you know this is the extraordinary thing about men.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:27.120]   Having lost this thing through his disobedience and through his rebellion against God, he
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.240]   even tries to make it up by means of religion.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.720]   All the religions of the world tonight, the so-called great religions of the world, are
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.360]   nothing but repetitions of this ancient action.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.880]   Men so trying to answer the question and to fill the gap.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:53.240]   Let me give you but one illustration from contemporary thought which is most interesting.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.880]   Take men like Mr. Aldous Huxley.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.840]   Undoubtedly a brilliant man, a brilliant writer and thinker.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:10.440]   Mr. Aldous Huxley twenty years ago and before that was quite convinced that men could solve
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:16.120]   his problems and could arrive at a state of completion by means of pure thought.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.360]   He belonged to the school that taught that and he was one of the leaders in the school.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.480]   Men have nothing to do but to think and to educate himself and to work things out logically.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.520]   If he only becomes scientific, he said in his various books and novels, if he only lives
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.920]   a scientific kind of life, well then all the problems are going to be banished and solved
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.240]   and all will be well.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.280]   But he no longer says that.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.760]   He came to see that that wasn't the answer.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   What is it now?
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.440]   Well, he says now that this is the answer.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:58.920]   The only thing he says that can save the world is mysticism and he's become a Buddhist.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.520]   He's turned to religion, you see, to a religion.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.120]   In other words, he's aware of the fact that man isn't just a pure intellect, that man
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.520]   has got a spirit, that man has feelings and emotions, that man is a bigger total than
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.840]   he'd thought of before and he's crying out for the unseen.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.800]   There is another realm, he says, another dimension.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.240]   He calls it mysticism.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.480]   He means by that that there is a spiritual realm which is influencing us and we can only
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.540]   be truly happy and make up our loss as long as we're in accord with it and as long as
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.000]   we submit to it so he follows the mystic route, the mystic way.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   He's turned to religion.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.240]   Well, now man, you see, has been doing this throughout the centuries.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.840]   Having turned from the only true and living God, he's had to make gods for himself.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.640]   He's made his religions.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.040]   He tries everything but the God whom he's departed from.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:59.400]   And so the whole time he repeats this procedure of stitching together the few fig leaves in
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.020]   order to try to hide his nakedness.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.560]   But it's all inadequate, it's all even ridiculous, it's amateurish, doesn't it seem foolish?
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.880]   Isn't it almost laughable?
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.160]   And yet, you see, that's the very thing that man still refuses to recognize.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.760]   Men and women still scoff at Christianity and there they are giving themselves to these
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.440]   other things that have been proved to be failures so often throughout the centuries.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.600]   They're trying to cover the nakedness.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.720]   They are trying somehow or another to make up the deficiency, the sense of something
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.360]   lost, something that we still need and cannot find.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.680]   Man tries to deal with it along his own efforts.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:56.000]   And then that brings me to the next thing, which comes out so prominently in this record.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.960]   Man has a sense of guilt and a sense of fear.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.040]   They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:15.680]   and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.640]   You remember that formerly they'd accepted the statement of the devil, "Ye shall not
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   surely die."
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.380]   There's no need to be afraid, they said.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.880]   You just use your mind and assert yourself and stand up for yourself and express yourself
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.400]   and there's absolutely nothing to fear at all.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.560]   But they heard the voice and they ran and they hid themselves.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   Why?
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:45.480]   Well, a sense of fear, a sense of guilt, a sense of shame.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.680]   And again, it is just the message of this book to tell us that that's true of all of
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   us.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.720]   I know we don't like that statement, but you can't get away from it.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.820]   It is the simple truth.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:04.560]   We like to say on paper, and we do say in theory, don't we, well, that we are masters
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.880]   of our fate and captains of our souls, that we no longer are going to be governed by these
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:16.120]   phobias and fears, that we take a thoroughly rational scientific view of life and that
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.400]   we do what we want to do and believe in doing and we're not going to be frightened by anything.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:27.080]   But alas, unfortunately, like Adam and Eve before us, it's one thing to say that, but
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.440]   it's a very different thing to experience that.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.280]   And the whole tragedy of mankind tonight is this, that man is in this contradictory position.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.120]   He says he's not afraid, and yet he's terrified.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:48.400]   He says he doesn't believe in sin and in God, but he's got a sense of condemnation.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.320]   He's got a vice within him that accuses him and condemns him.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.320]   He is filled with a sense of shame.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.080]   He is unhappy.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.120]   He said to himself last night, "There's nothing wrong in that."
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.240]   A temptation came, he said, "It's all right.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.640]   I'm no longer living in the mid-Victorian era.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.600]   I'm not going to be frightened by the shibboleths of religion.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.960]   I'm not going to be alarmed.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.080]   I know I'm taking a scientific view.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   I've got these qualities and powers within me and they're meant to be exercised and I
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.360]   can exercise them and all is well."
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.240]   And he did.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.720]   But he woke up this morning feeling ashamed.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:31.000]   He had a sense of condemnation within him and it's gnawing at his conscience ever since.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.360]   He may be in this service at this moment for that very reason.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.240]   He's unhappy, he's miserable.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.800]   There's always a reaction.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.600]   The stone fruit is not as pleasant as we thought.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.600]   There's always something.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.520]   There's a kind of spiritual indigestion that follows the eating of it.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.360]   We can't get away with it somehow.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.920]   If we could, of course, you wouldn't need any psychologists.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.760]   But they're doing a thriving business.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.120]   And they're doing a thriving business for the reason that I'm giving you.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.440]   That though we are so bold and so wonderful, there's something within us that tells us
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.200]   that we are cads, that we're cowards, that we're fools, that we're ugly, that we're
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.360]   foul, that we're vile, that we're beasts and worse.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.720]   And we can't get rid of it.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.360]   We can't sleep because of it.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.760]   We can't silence this vice that's within us.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.020]   If only we could.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.080]   But we cannot.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.640]   And we're unhappy and we're wretched and we have complexes.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.560]   We'll call them that but we won't call it sin.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.100]   We won't admit it's fear.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.520]   We won't admit it's shame.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.920]   The complex, the strain, the pressure.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.720]   Isn't that the simple truth?
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   We'd like to explain it all away psychologically but we cannot.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.640]   We are up against the facts.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.360]   And the facts within ourselves and with respect to ourselves.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:58.440]   Though we want to get rid of God and all that belongs to him, we cannot.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:05.320]   For the fact is that we've all, every man born into this world, has within him a sense
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.920]   of God and a sense of judgment.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   Say if you like that you don't believe in God, you've got a sense of God.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.620]   And you have to argue with yourself.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:24.440]   And all your intellectual arguments are really brought forward to boost your own assertion.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.200]   While you are asserting that you don't believe and that you can prove scientifically and
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:34.320]   so on, there is something within you that's pronouncing and objecting against it.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.560]   And is assuring you that there is a God.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.240]   And you're speaking with eloquence in order to drown the voice within you that speaks
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   for God.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   It's in us all.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.280]   There is a sense of God universal in mankind.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.800]   Even in the most primitive tribes and races, they've all got it.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.960]   A sense of God and a sense of judgment.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:03.160]   Yes, and coupled with that, I'm being brutally frank, am I not?
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.080]   A fear of death.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   A fear of death.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:15.280]   "Ah, but you see, the modern man isn't afraid of death, isn't he?
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.120]   Why does he take so much trouble to avoid speaking about it then?
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.880]   Why does he regard it as morbid to be reminded of it?"
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.560]   The fact of the matter is that this present age has a horror of death.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.120]   It's controlled in a sense by the fear of death, as the scripture puts it.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:39.240]   All their lifetime are subject to bondage because of the fear of death.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.800]   Well, let me give you the great statement of that very thing by Shakespeare.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:50.080]   He's put it in his customary manner, once and forever, in the words, you remember, of
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:59.800]   Hamlet, "The Dilemma."
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:07.520]   Is it worth going on with life, with all its contradictions and its problems and its pains
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.240]   and its difficulties?
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.080]   Why go on?
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.880]   To be or not to be?
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.120]   That is the question.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:28.160]   Whether it is nobler in the mind to take up arms against outrageous fortune and so on,
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.880]   but come to the end.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.400]   Here's the problem confronting us all.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.800]   Why go on with it?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.360]   Disappointments, sorrows.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:47.760]   There was a brilliant young MP not many years ago who faced it all, and he wrote the account
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.680]   of it before he committed suicide.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:58.040]   He had a brilliant future before him, and he knew that he had very good prospects of
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.200]   perhaps becoming even the Prime Minister of this country.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.760]   But he worked it out like this.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:10.120]   He said, "I know perfectly well that if I go on living and keep my eye on that, I shall
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.440]   make many enemies.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.760]   I don't want to make enemies of them, but because I succeed, they will be jealous of
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.800]   me, and they'll dislike me, and they'll become my enemies, and there'll be disappointments,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.040]   all sorts of things."
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.040]   He said, "Is it worth it?"
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.480]   And he decided that it wasn't.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.760]   But he was a very exceptional person.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.720]   The average person, as Shakespeare reminds us, doesn't do that.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.560]   He says, "I could end it all with a bare bodkin.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.200]   I could do it in a second.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.840]   Well, why don't I then?
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:57.320]   Who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:05.480]   after death, the undiscovered country from whose born no traveller returns, puzzles the
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:15.400]   will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of?
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:24.360]   Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, and the native hue of resolution is sicklied
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.480]   o'er with the pale cast of thought."
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.600]   Isn't it absolutely true?
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:39.880]   However intellectual, however rational, however calm and cool and collective, we can't evade
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.160]   it, we can't avoid it.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:49.240]   This sense of God, this sense of guilt, this sense of shame, this sense of judgment, this
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.840]   sense of death and what lies beyond it.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.280]   "Dost thou art a dust-returnest?
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.560]   Was not spoken of the soul?
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:03.960]   If it had been, very well, I'd take up the bodkin and end it."
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   But it isn't.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.680]   It isn't spoken of the soul.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.120]   The soul goes on.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.600]   And it's that, as Shakespeare reminds us, which thus cripples the will, as it were.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.720]   And we decide to go on with it, but the fear remains and we can't get away.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.480]   And the guilt and the shame and all the agony and all the remorse and all the kicking of
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:31.360]   ourselves metaphorically, on and on and on it goes.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.260]   It started at the beginning and it has been continuing ever since.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:45.800]   But lastly, for me to close, the next thing is this.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   And it's here we see the inaudible folly of men in sin.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:38:00.760]   In his trouble and in his misery and wretchedness, he runs away from and hides from God.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.920]   "Ed, they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the evening.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.560]   And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God from the midst
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.560]   of the trees.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:19.440]   But God called to him again, 'Adam, where art thou?'"
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:26.480]   And this is the saddest and the most tragic thing of all about men.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.680]   He runs away from God.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.880]   He runs away from the call of God, the voice of the God that comes to him in the garden
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.840]   in the cool of the day, in his shame and misery and wretchedness.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.840]   Why?
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.880]   Well, because he doesn't know him, because he's believed a lie about him, because he's
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:59.080]   altogether wrong with respect to him, because he doesn't realize that it is the very God
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   against whom he's rebelled and into his face he's spat, is the only one who can save him
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.200]   and is prepared to do so.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   That's the tragedy.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.840]   There he is, I say, in shame and in failure and in utter hopelessness.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.080]   And God comes and the voice of this, and he runs and hides.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.600]   He runs away from God.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.120]   He's only benefactor.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.520]   He's only saviour.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.600]   That's the tragedy of the world this evening.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:45.520]   Man in his misery, man in his sin, tries everything but what God says to him.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.840]   You see, I've been making the same point from the very beginning, haven't I?
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.760]   We start, you see, with the voice from God, the word from God.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.400]   Man was made in God's image and he spoke to God and God spoke to him.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.000]   But then he listened to the other voice and he ceased to listen to God and all his troubles
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   followed.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.440]   And God speaks again and again man doesn't listen.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.760]   He runs away in fear.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.560]   And that is precisely, I say, what man is doing tonight.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.040]   What am I doing in this pulpit?
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.640]   I'm nothing here and what a privilege.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.920]   I'm just a mouthpiece for God.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:35.520]   My dear friend, you in sin this evening are being addressed by the voice of God.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.560]   It's coming to you in the cool of the evening.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.520]   Are you afraid?
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.080]   Are you resisting him?
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.800]   Are you running away from him in some shape or form?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.580]   Do you feel that he's against you?
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.160]   Are you rebelling against his message?
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.680]   Are you trying to argue against it and to push it off?
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.520]   Are you afraid of the consequences of listening?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:03.160]   If so, you're just repeating what Adam and Eve did.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:12.760]   For you know, God came into the garden and spoke to them to tell them that in spite of
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:23.360]   everything they'd done, though he'd got to punish them for doing it, he was also providing
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.320]   a way of salvation and of deliverance.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.720]   That was exactly why he came.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:37.560]   Not merely to denounce them and to pass judgment upon them, but the promise of the seed of
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:44.200]   the woman and the conquest over the enemy that had got them down.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.880]   And that is the message of the gospel.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.600]   And that is my simple message this evening.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.760]   There is nothing under heaven tonight and there is no one save Jesus Christ and him
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.720]   crucified who can meet your need.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.320]   You are aware of the restlessness, the thirst, the hunger, the searching for something you
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   cannot find.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.880]   What are you searching for?
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   What you really need?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:15.080]   Oh, let Augustine answer again in the great word, "Thou hast made us for thyself and our
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:21.560]   souls are restless until they find their rest in thee."
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.280]   My dear friend, you are made on that scale.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.360]   There is nobody that can satisfy you.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:33.120]   There is nothing less than the mighty, almighty, eternal God himself.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.320]   And you see, he does so in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.680]   He brings you back to himself.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.960]   He'll deal with all these subsidiary problems which I've been mentioning.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.640]   Give up trying to solve it.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.680]   Give up trying to deliver yourself.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.840]   Give up trying to get rid of your sense of guilt, for you never will.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.680]   Your conscience will follow you.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.440]   As long as you're alive, it will go with you beyond the grave and it will torment you in
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.000]   hell to all eternity.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.520]   You'll never silence it.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.840]   You'll never get rid of a sense of failure.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:12.680]   You'll never get rid of a sense of guilt and of shame until you come to Jesus Christ and
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.880]   believe what he tells you, that he's taken your guilt upon himself, that he's died for
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:23.120]   your sins, that God has punished them there and offers you free pardon.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.720]   That's the meaning of this communion.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:36.240]   Jesus Christ was crucified on Calvary's hill for that reason and for that alone.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.720]   He bore your judgment.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.760]   The wrath of God fell upon him.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:49.960]   And because of that, if you believe in him, the wrath of God no longer abides on you.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:55.040]   God assures you that he's pardoned you freely, washed away your sins.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.200]   He'll take away the sense of guilt and of shame.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.920]   You'll know that you're forgiven.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.440]   He'll know that you're a child of God.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.520]   He'll give you new strength and power.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.360]   He'll give you a new understanding.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.880]   He'll give you a new insight.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.520]   You'll see things differently.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.040]   You'll reason differently.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:18.160]   You'll have a new view of life altogether, a new view of death, a new view of judgment,
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.920]   a new view of eternity, a new view of God himself, so that instead of running away from
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.960]   him and whimpering and hiding yourself and feeling that he's against you, "Oh, you'll
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:35.120]   long, believe me, beyond anything else in this life and in this world, you'll long
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.640]   to hear the voice of God."
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:46.600]   You will begin to say, "Speak, I pray thee, gentle Jesus.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:55.640]   Oh, how passing sweet thy words, breathing o'er my troubled spirit, peace which never
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.480]   earth affords.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:10.440]   All the world's distracting voices, all its enticing tones of ill, at thine accents mild
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:16.560]   melodious, are subdued and all is still.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:23.240]   My beloved friend, have you heard the voice of God speaking to you here tonight?
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:31.840]   He has been speaking, the voice of God, showing you your failure, your misery, your unhappiness,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.520]   your wretchedness, the cause of it, how nothing else can ever deliver you out of it, but that
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:46.960]   he has provided a way to deliver you in his only begotten Son, who gave his life for you
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.240]   because he loved you.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:56.480]   Come out of your hiding place, come to him, rush to him, cast yourself at his feet, say,
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.440]   I believe, just as I am.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.060]   I don't understand.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:08.040]   Many a conflict, many a doubt, but nothing else can, so just as I am, I come."
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:14.360]   And if you do, he will smile upon you and let you know that he has received you, and
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:20.920]   he will bless you throughout the remainder of this, your earthly life, in death, and
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.640]   receive you unto himself in glory.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.520]   Amen.
