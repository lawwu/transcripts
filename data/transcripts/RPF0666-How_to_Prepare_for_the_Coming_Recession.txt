[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.600]   In the United States, the yield curve has inverted.

[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.400]   ♪
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.080]   If you are not familiar with the concept
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   of the inverted yield curve,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.240]   it has been in the past decades
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   one of the more reliable indicators of recession.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.420]   And the most important thing is when the 90-day T-bill rate
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.180]   rises above the 30-year Treasury bond rate.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.560]   So I want you to imagine what that means.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.060]   That means that if you give money
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.800]   to the United States government,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.100]   you are promised a lower rate of return
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.000]   if you give that to the government for 30 years
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600]   than if you give it to the government for 90 days.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.900]   That violates all of the normal expectations
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   about investing.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.100]   You say, "Well, I'll give you my money,
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.640]   but pay me 2% for 90 days,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.340]   but pay me 6% for 30 years."
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.420]   Well, when that gets out of whack
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.240]   and you have people saying, "Pay me 2% for 90 days,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.380]   but pay me 1.5% for 30 years,"
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.480]   it signals that people are more interested
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.520]   in the return of their money and safety
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.120]   than the return on their money.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.820]   And this particular inverted yield curve
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.200]   has historically, fairly predictably,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.740]   been a signal of coming recession.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.840]   Now, it's not exclusive.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.200]   There's no guarantee.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.840]   I always try to keep in the back of my mind
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.740]   that quip that economists have successfully predicted
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.580]   28 of the last seven recessions
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.740]   or whatever your version of that is.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.580]   And I think it's true.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.280]   I think certainly fears and concerns
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120]   over recession can be overblown.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.260]   All a recession means
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.820]   is that the gross domestic product decreases
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820]   for, what is it, two quarters, two consecutive quarters?
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.820]   That's all it means.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.300]   So it doesn't mean that the end of the world is here.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.100]   It doesn't mean that people are going to be
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.560]   pointing guns at your house and stealing your food.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   It doesn't necessarily have to be extremely catastrophic,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.800]   and we don't necessarily have to even be right.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.240]   It's possible that things could change,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.740]   and there may not be a recession.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.540]   Predicting the timings of the movements
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.400]   and the aggregate indicators
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.180]   of hundreds of millions of people's
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.540]   individual financial activities is, of course,
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.180]   a very difficult and risky business.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.260]   So I want to start today by talking about recession
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.120]   and talk to you about my planning philosophy
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   when it comes to things like recession.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.260]   You'll notice that in that intro,
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.220]   I said, "The coming recession."
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.660]   Long listeners of the show know
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.060]   that I actually have a course called
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.660]   How to Survive and Thrive
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.340]   During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.580]   And that sounds extremely sensational
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.140]   when I say, "The coming recession."
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.580]   And I intend it that way.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.980]   I want to grab your interest.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.340]   I want to be sensational.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.280]   But astute listeners will always notice
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   that I never personally assign a specific time period.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.020]   And although I have a fairly
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.960]   catastrophic-sounding course,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.820]   How to Survive and Thrive
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.500]   During the Coming Economic Crisis,
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.960]   that course is extremely practical,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.660]   and there is not a single prediction of a single date.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.000]   And just like today, I'm not making,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.100]   I'm not competent to make any prediction
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.480]   of any certain date.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.500]   All I know is that a recession is coming.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.400]   When it comes, I don't know.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.140]   And it could be, you could allege
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.640]   that's kind of a weasely statement
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.080]   because you can at any time say
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   that a recession is coming,
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.760]   even if you're in the middle of a recession,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.580]   and you may be right.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.420]   You're gonna be right,
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.260]   bear with me.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.080]   It might take 10 years,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   but you're gonna be right at some point.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.860]   There will be a recession.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.420]   We live in an economy where,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.900]   due to the way the economy has managed and influenced,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.100]   we go through periods of boom times and bust times.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.160]   So that's where we live.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.220]   That's what we do.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.360]   But it is important to remember
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   that recessions are nothing new.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.300]   They come along just like buses, pretty regularly.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.940]   But yet it's been quite a while
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.300]   since we've had a recession in the United States.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.660]   It goes back to 2008, 2007, 2008, 2009,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.460]   that period there was the last time
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.540]   that we officially had a recession in the United States.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.180]   And so if you think about it,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.900]   there's actually a whole generation of people today
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.740]   who have never experienced a recession,
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.300]   who haven't gone through a recession.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.260]   And I want to prepare you for that
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.660]   by talking to you about the planning steps
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.060]   for you to be thinking about to prepare for recession.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.340]   Because recessions can be really, really difficult.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.620]   Now, I will never make my bets
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.220]   based upon something that has to happen.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.980]   I, with the exception of perhaps some speculative moves
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.180]   that you want to make, which there is a place for that
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.340]   in your investing life and your business life,
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.900]   I generally, being a fairly conservative person,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.180]   I want to have a plan no matter what happens.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.920]   So I'm not going to make my bet upon
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.900]   recession coming in 2019, or recession coming in 2020,
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.900]   or recession has to come in 2021.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.540]   I'm not going to give myself over to a prediction
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.420]   of recession coming in 2020,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.040]   and then find myself in 2021 with a booming economy
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.340]   and then I've got no participation in that.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.460]   I make my bets based upon being prepared for whatever comes.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.500]   And everything in this show,
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.220]   every step I'm going to talk to you about
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.620]   will be practical and useful,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.340]   and it will not hurt you to do,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.940]   even if recession doesn't come.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.560]   The only thing that you will lose,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.420]   at the worst case scenario,
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.540]   by following the recommendations that I give in today's show
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.220]   is some time from your schedule.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.820]   Perhaps you won't quite get through the latest series
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.580]   on your subscription TV plan
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.420]   because you're doing some financial work instead.
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.960]   Or perhaps in theory, with some of my suggestions,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.420]   you might pay a few more dollars in interest
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.860]   on maintaining some of your debt
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.100]   or something in the coming months.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.580]   But beyond that, I'm not going to give you
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.100]   a single suggestion in this show that will cost you,
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.180]   that will be bad for you if recession doesn't come.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.180]   So I am concerned that recession may come.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.380]   It may come fairly soon.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.980]   And I think there are very good reasons to think
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.500]   that the next recession in the United States
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.360]   could be a very significant and deep one.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.620]   But I'm swayed by the arguments in that direction,
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.700]   personally.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.420]   But I'm not going to bet the farm
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.060]   on that being the absolute guaranteed plan.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.920]   I'm going to be prepared
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.940]   if there's a deep, long, hard recession.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.980]   I'm going to be prepared if there's a mild, short recession.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.220]   I'm going to be prepared if there's no recession.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.400]   And I'm going to make sure that I have plans in place
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.580]   for all of those.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.060]   And that's what I invite you to come along with me
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.300]   in today's show.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.940]   I want to give you additionally a few important reasons
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.500]   to prepare for recession.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.180]   You may not remember the depth and pain
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.340]   of the most recent recession,
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.300]   because perhaps for you,
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.820]   it wasn't a deeply painful experience.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.580]   But it was a deeply painful experience
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.860]   for many millions of people.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.280]   And recessions hurt.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.460]   People get hurt during times of bad economics.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.420]   And those hurts can go deep,
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.560]   and they can have broad ranging ripple effects.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.200]   There was an entire generation
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.340]   that was transformed for their entire lifetime
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.780]   by their experiences in the Great Depression.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.100]   If you interact with your parents and your grandparents
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.500]   who went through the Great Depression,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.140]   almost every person could,
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.980]   for the rest of those people's lives,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.180]   point to the things that they did
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.620]   because of their experience in the Great Depression.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.100]   It transformed an entire generation.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.220]   It transformed the politics of the nation.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.660]   If you go back and you study US American history,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.800]   the Great Depression was a deciding point
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   in the change in the direction of the US political system.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.620]   It turned my grandparents
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.820]   into diehard lifelong Democrats.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.020]   Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.260]   and his work during the Great Depression
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.300]   turned an entire generation of people
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.020]   into lifelong diehard Democrats.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.740]   And it completely changed the political system.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.820]   Now, it's interesting to look and say,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.180]   "Well, what actually happened?"
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.620]   But the reality is none of that matters.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.420]   It did change people.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.980]   And recessions hurt.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.180]   When people are in financial distress,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.420]   there's almost nothing good that comes from it.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.900]   As your stress levels rise,
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.540]   your health is likely to go down.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.260]   The stress creates acid in your body.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.620]   It causes you to be unhealthy,
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.100]   causes you not to sleep well.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.820]   People start drinking more,
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.860]   abusing drugs more to try to escape,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.900]   watching more TV,
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.020]   doing things that are unhealthy
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.540]   to try to deal with the stress.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.700]   All of that has a ripple effect in their life.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.460]   Family relationships are often harmed.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.500]   It's a whole lot easier to yell at your children
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.920]   and abuse your children when you're feeling stressed
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.900]   than it is when you feel good.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.920]   It's a whole lot easier for the things
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.980]   that your spouse does that,
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.660]   in good times, they don't really bother you.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.060]   It's a whole lot easier to blow up and yell at them
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.340]   when they do something,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.260]   when you're feeling intense stress.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:19.380]   The financial impacts of a recession go long and deep.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.820]   If you start missing payments,
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.060]   your credit score is destroyed.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.260]   That has an effect for years.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.700]   You lose your house, you get foreclosed.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.580]   That can have an effect on your family for years.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.940]   Can have an effect on your ability
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.780]   to buy another house for years.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.700]   When you lose your job,
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.140]   it can have an effect on your career for years.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.220]   And if you lose your job in the middle of a recession
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.740]   and you have several years of either no earnings
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.700]   or subpar earnings,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.420]   that will have a dramatic ripple effect
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.260]   throughout your life.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.220]   You can't save as much money,
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.620]   can't invest as much money.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.460]   Even things like your social security credits
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.860]   are messed up by that.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.820]   So recessions hurt,
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.540]   but they don't have to hurt you
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.180]   as much as they might hurt other people
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.340]   if you are prepared.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.060]   And always remember this,
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.260]   the best way to help the poor
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.520]   is to start by not being one of them.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.300]   The best way to help those who are hurting
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.900]   is to start by not being one of them.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:25.020]   So collectively, you and I have an opportunity
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.300]   to prepare so that we are positioned
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.600]   to help our neighbors during what could be
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.460]   a very difficult time.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.300]   I've worked hard to strengthen myself
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.220]   so that I can help you if you are in a weaker position.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.220]   Now I want to strengthen you
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.280]   so that you'll be in a position to help your neighbor
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.060]   if they're in a weaker position.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.980]   And that's how one by one,
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.540]   we can impact one another
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.400]   and we can help one another
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.780]   and we can collectively build stronger communities.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.040]   I'll repeat for you again,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.940]   one of my favorite lines
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.400]   from my friend Jonathan Walton's poetry.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.120]   "We are people pebbles tossed into a pool.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.400]   "Every ripple I create in turn ripples you.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.420]   "So in unison we are rippling,
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.860]   "a type of ripple rhythm,
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.340]   "but we need to ripple in a way that benefits our living."
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.440]   So I'm hoping to impact you in today's show
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.100]   with some very useful, thoughtful things
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.900]   that you can do to prepare for the coming recession.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.620]   The number one most important thing that you can do
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.020]   to prepare for the coming recession
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.740]   is to focus on maintaining your job,
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.900]   maintaining your employment,
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.420]   maintaining your income.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.620]   That is your number one highest priority in a recession
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.360]   is to maintain your income.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.500]   If you do nothing else that I recommend,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.460]   but you maintain your job,
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.020]   your life and your lifestyle during a recession
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.280]   is likely to be just about the same as it is now.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.340]   But if you lose your job,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.940]   everything else in your life is impacted.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.260]   So your highest priority in a recession
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260]   or preparing for a recession is to maintain your job.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.140]   Now, how do you do that?
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.420]   Well, there are a number of things that you can do,
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.060]   but first recognize there's not the time to be a slacker.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.180]   And if you're gonna slack off at work,
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.300]   this is not the time.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.300]   You want to make sure that you are on the list of employees
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.140]   who is always seen as the most valuable employees.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.140]   If people are gonna be cut,
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.140]   you wanna be the last to be cut.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.540]   Because if you can maintain your income through a recession,
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.620]   the recession won't personally impact you all that much.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.560]   But if you can't, you will remember the recession.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.060]   So how do you maintain your job?
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.820]   Well, this is gonna be one of the most important things
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.660]   I'm gonna release in the coming days.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.460]   I'm gonna re-release a replay of three shows
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.120]   I recorded several years ago
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.660]   that's entirely focused on this specific question.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.100]   It's that important.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.440]   So I think that that three to four hours of audio
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.220]   on this one question is going to be sufficient to answer it.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.060]   So I'm gonna breeze over it today.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.340]   But recognize that you are in competition
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.700]   with your coworkers and with all of the other
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.700]   potential people that are available in the marketplace.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.200]   Remember that employees compete with employees for work.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.620]   Employers and employees are not in competition
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.660]   with one another.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.540]   They collaborate, they work together.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.260]   But employers do compete with employers
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.020]   and employees do compete with other employees.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.020]   When you go and apply for a new job
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.420]   that you're trying to get,
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.420]   you simply have to be better
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.740]   than all of the other applicants for that job
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.100]   and show that you're a better fit,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.220]   you're a better candidate.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.040]   That's your job.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.420]   That's how you get the job.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.220]   And so the same thing happens
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.020]   when you are on the list for being cut.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.220]   Corporate executives and leaders look down and say,
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.460]   we're having problems.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.380]   Sales are going down.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.900]   That's what, when gross domestic product contracts,
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.060]   what that's measuring is that sales in different companies
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.820]   and different industries are decreasing.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.020]   Companies are not able to sell and produce
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.060]   as much product as they otherwise are.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.340]   So when sales contract,
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.020]   that starts to eat into the profit margins of a company.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.180]   And so the managers of that company start to look and say,
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.420]   well, what's happening?
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.420]   And as they look at their profit margins being squeezed,
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.540]   they usually will wait a little bit
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.580]   to see whether this is just a temporary thing.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.740]   After all, sales can wander around all the time.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.500]   Some people have seasonal sales problems.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.660]   They sell more in winter than in summer, et cetera.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.540]   And so they wait to see what's happening.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.940]   As the managers see that the sales decline is continuing,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.340]   then they start to make plans.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.220]   Now they may not act right away.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.060]   Most companies would maintain some kind of reserves.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.180]   They may start to eat into those reserves
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.100]   because they've built a company infrastructure
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.980]   that they feel serves their needs,
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.100]   and they wanna maintain it.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.700]   They don't immediately wanna start axing things.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.380]   But if sales continue to go down and to stay down,
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.940]   then company management has to make changes.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.060]   They have to start cutting expenses.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.260]   The only way to maintain profitability
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.660]   if sales are going down is to either increase sales
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.580]   or to cut expenses.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.460]   So if the company managers can't figure out a way
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.340]   to increase sales, they then have to go to expenses.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.980]   Now, when you look at expenses
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.780]   and you look at many companies, if not most companies,
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.580]   the single greatest expense that most companies face
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.220]   on an ongoing basis is generally going to be
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.180]   the cost of employees.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.860]   Employees are extremely expensive.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.740]   Not only is it your salary, but it's your benefits.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.580]   It's also the plant and equipment necessary
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.740]   for you to do your job.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.500]   And employees are also some of the most easily adjusted,
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.980]   maybe too strong of a statement,
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.700]   but there's some things that can be easily cut off.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.060]   If a company has a big factory
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.580]   and they need that factory to produce their wares,
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.060]   it's easier to lay off a third of the factory workers
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.540]   and then plan to hire them again in two years
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.420]   than it is for them to sell the factory.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.820]   'Cause building a factory is generally a lot harder
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.060]   than hiring new factory workers.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.300]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.100]   Hiring and training good employees is very difficult.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.900]   It's extremely expensive and time-consuming
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.780]   for an employer to do.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.380]   But in general, human capital, the employees,
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.180]   is going to be easier for them to decrease and increase
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.260]   to keep pace with the times.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.140]   So company management is going to sit down
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.860]   and they're going to look at the cost structure
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.700]   of their company.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.980]   The first thing they'll do is they'll try to trim off
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.180]   any non-essential workers.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.020]   Now, if you are in a job that you don't think is fundamental
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.060]   and core to the productivity and the profitability
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.900]   of that company, that probably means you
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.980]   as a non-essential worker.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.820]   And so you should be prepared for that.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.660]   This is why if you're involved
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.220]   in a highly compensated position
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.900]   where you are directly impacting the productivity
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.140]   and profitability of the company,
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.020]   you're much more likely to keep your job
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.500]   than if you're just an ancillary assistant.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.180]   If you work as an assistant to a mid-level manager,
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.380]   chances are that mid-level manager can get by
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.620]   without an assistant, or they can lay off three assistants
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.540]   and bring on and have one assistant
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.340]   serve four mid-level managers.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.420]   But if you're a key and star salesman for the company,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.540]   they can't lay you off.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.260]   First of all, of course, you have the benefit
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.420]   that your compensation is directly tied
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.620]   to the profitability of the company.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.100]   They know how much to pay you because they only pay you
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.740]   when money comes in, and they need you
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.780]   because they need income to rise.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.260]   They're going to maintain profitability
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.060]   either by increasing income or decreasing expenses.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.540]   As a salesman, you help to increase income.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.020]   So non-essential jobs, non-essential positions
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.700]   are largely going to be cut.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.020]   The other thing that's going to happen
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.500]   is the managers will look at a recession
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.580]   as an opportunity to conveniently,
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.740]   without a lot of stress, without a lot of bad press,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.460]   to conveniently make the company more efficient.
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.260]   What tends to happen during periods of expansion
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.100]   in a good, booming business cycle
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.220]   is managers, in preparing for future growth,
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.620]   tend to overhire.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.900]   And they wind up with people who,
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.900]   yeah, they're doing something,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.220]   but they're not particularly important.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.420]   And so when you go into a recession,
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.900]   you have a convenient opportunity
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.980]   to get rid of the people who are poor performers,
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.500]   to get rid of and streamline some of the jobs
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.460]   and make things more profitable.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.700]   And so it's a really unique opportunity
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.500]   where you can do that where people understand.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.780]   If you start laying people off
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.340]   when there's a good economy, et cetera,
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.060]   then the workers say, "What's going on here?"
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.700]   But if you lay people off in a recession,
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.380]   the rest of your workforce is going to be
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.780]   more understanding of your moves as a manager.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.820]   So if the CEO says to each of the department heads,
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.260]   "You need to trim your expenses by 20%,"
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.180]   well, the department heads can simply sit down,
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.300]   look at their employee roster,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.900]   and trim off the 20% of the employees
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.420]   that they don't like, that aren't productive,
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.340]   that aren't team players,
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.580]   or whatever their personal criteria are.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.700]   So your first job is to make sure
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.820]   that you're not in that bottom 20%.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.700]   This is why it's so important in any job
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.660]   that you're always in at least the top 20% of the workforce
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.420]   because almost no company would ever cut positions
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.340]   in the top 20% of workers.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.900]   The company has to go totally bankrupt in that situation
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.260]   to cut people there.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.540]   But if you're in that bottom 20%,
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.780]   there's a very good chance you're out.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.980]   So your job is to be a more important,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.140]   valuable employee to your employer
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.740]   than all of your fellow employees.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.760]   You're competing against your fellow employees
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.980]   to be higher on the list and thus later in the cuts
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.180]   to be laid off.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.380]   Now, this may come in and be a factor also
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.740]   with regard to your pay.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.060]   You can't necessarily predict in all circumstances
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.620]   it's just based upon performance.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.620]   It might be that you are a very highly paid employee.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.060]   And this is one of the biggest challenges for older workers,
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.140]   workers who are established,
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.060]   who've been at a company for a very long time,
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.820]   they've generated increases in pay,
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.760]   they have a lot of pension benefits, et cetera.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.460]   Those workers can be very expensive
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.460]   for a company to maintain.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.220]   And so that's also a risk.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.940]   So I'm gonna release replay of three episodes
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.300]   into the podcast feed that are hours and hours
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.780]   on this subject to help you prepare
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.620]   for to not get laid off in the coming recession.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.420]   I think the titles are
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.740]   how to not get laid off in the coming recession,
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.060]   what to do if you just got laid off in the coming recession.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.920]   And the third one was,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.260]   or how to prepare to get laid off in the coming,
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.700]   if you get laid off in the coming recession.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.540]   And the third one was
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.620]   what to do if you just got laid off in the recession.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.460]   So we'll deal with some of these
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.720]   career strategies exhaustively.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.420]   The key thing for you to recognize
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.520]   is your number one target, your number one goal
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.980]   is don't lose your job in the coming recession.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.100]   So start thinking about what you can do now
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.620]   in your current job so that you don't lose your job
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.500]   in the coming recession.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.000]   Now, if you do lose your job,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.740]   recognize that this is not necessarily a disaster.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.160]   A job loss can be an opportunity in and of itself.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.860]   I personally was laid off just prior to the 2008 recession.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.940]   And it turned out to be a great blessing for me.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.320]   I did not see it coming.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.720]   I had been working at a marketing
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.220]   and brand management consulting company.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.140]   I was working as a mid-level analyst,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.420]   junior analyst, whatever.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.420]   And I had decided that it wasn't a good fit for me.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.220]   Basically the industry, the corporate structure
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.660]   wasn't a good fit for me.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.340]   And I was planning to leave in January of 2009
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.680]   because I just didn't see
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.940]   how I had any long-term career there.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.820]   But I was sticking it out
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.660]   because I was trying to fulfill my,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.740]   I wanted to leave on good terms.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.220]   I wanted to have worked there enough
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.500]   to make my boss a lot of money
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.740]   for the risks that they had taken in hiring me.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.340]   And so I was planning to leave in January of 2009.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.700]   I was unexpectedly laid off in June of 2008.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.460]   And at the time, I couldn't believe it.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.500]   I had gotten great performance reviews.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.940]   I had, I thought I was doing,
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.200]   I'd just gotten a nice pay raise.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.860]   I thought everything was good.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.600]   And I don't think it was really my fault.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.660]   They reorganized the company
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.180]   and they eliminated all of the people that were at my level.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.060]   And they kept the senior level management
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.620]   and the junior level employees.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.660]   And they kind of cut away my level,
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.500]   but it was a shock.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.380]   I did not expect it.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.220]   I didn't know what to do
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.440]   'cause I didn't have a clear plan.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.480]   I had some ideas of what I wanted to do,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.100]   but it wound up in hindsight
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.180]   being a tremendous blessing for me
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.580]   because the recession hit in the fall of 2008.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.820]   And that was when the world was falling apart.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.540]   And I remember that in,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.380]   as I looked in January of 2009,
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.580]   I looked around and I said to myself,
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.780]   "You know what?
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.020]   If I were still working,
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.020]   I would not have the guts to quit in January of 2009.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.860]   I would be so scared by the economy
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.500]   and the recession and whatever
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.680]   that I wouldn't have been able to follow through
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.520]   on my own plans."
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.020]   And so it turned out to be a great blessing to me.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.180]   And I remember in the fall of 2008,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.860]   I had decided to become a financial advisor.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.660]   I'm driving to classes and taking classes.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.020]   And every day I'm driving home.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.980]   I was commuting back and forth to Miami
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.300]   and I'm driving home,
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.820]   hour, hour, hour and a half in the car,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.180]   listening to NPR talk about TARP
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.300]   and deal with the financial crisis and everything.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.580]   And I started my career in the depths of a recession
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.220]   as a financial advisor.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.140]   And I built it all through the period.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.600]   And so I just simply say from personal experience
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.820]   that if you do lose your job,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.820]   it can be an opportunity.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.780]   But it's most likely to be an opportunity
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.660]   if it's one you're prepared for.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.180]   Because if I had not been financially prepared
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.260]   for being laid off,
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.100]   I was out of debt,
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.140]   I had a big emergency fund,
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.420]   I had a very simple life at the time,
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.100]   I had few obligations,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.220]   was a single man,
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.300]   but being out of debt,
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.740]   having a big emergency fund,
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.500]   six months of expenses, et cetera,
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.660]   that made it possible for me to pivot,
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.860]   to start a new business
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.060]   where I didn't earn any income in the beginning
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.820]   and build to where I ultimately do today.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.740]   But financial planning makes a difference.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.860]   And so that's why we're gonna talk about financial planning
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.940]   in detail now.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.060]   Step one of preparing for a recession is
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.140]   make sure you focus and don't lose your job.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.100]   Step two is this,
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.540]   today, make a plan of what you would do
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.420]   if you lost your job.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.900]   If you're a dual income household,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.260]   what would you do if you both lost your jobs?
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.580]   What would you do if today,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.580]   you got called into your boss's office
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.540]   and your boss said,
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.020]   "Thank you very much for your service.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.300]   You've been a great worker,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.320]   but unfortunately we can't keep you."
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.420]   And you're laid off.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   You have a cardboard box,
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.340]   you pack up and you're ushered out the door by security.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.900]   What would you do in that circumstance?
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.860]   I want you to think this through very, very carefully.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.940]   And what we're doing here is called war gaming.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.860]   I want you to imagine and plan
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.820]   what you would do in that circumstance if you had to.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.380]   And that way you'll be prepared to do it
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.340]   when you have to, if you have to.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.820]   And this mental exercise
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.340]   makes all the difference in the world.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.300]   I'll tell you too, I thought it was funny,
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.780]   an embarrassing anecdote of how big of a deal this makes.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.580]   In 2008, when I got laid off,
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.820]   prior to that time,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.420]   I had been deeply influenced by Dave Ramsey's books
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.140]   and his programs.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.480]   I had organized,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.620]   I bought his Financial Peace University program.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.100]   I organized a group of my friends.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.940]   I paid for all this stuff
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.960]   and I took a group of my friends
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.380]   through Financial Peace University.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.220]   And in that iteration of Financial Peace University,
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.420]   I have no idea if it's still in his current versions
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.300]   of those courses, but in that course,
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.980]   when he was talking about the value
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.940]   and the importance of an emergency fund,
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.380]   he made a humorous anecdote about what it would be like
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.260]   if you got laid off and you had an emergency fund.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.060]   And he said something analogous to this quote.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.700]   He said, "If you've got a six months of emergency fund
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.300]   "and you get called into your boss's office
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.020]   "and you get laid off, you can just laugh and say,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.260]   "'Well, that's okay, how big's the severance?'"
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.020]   And it was a funny joke 'cause,
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.180]   hey, I'm not so concerned about losing my job
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.300]   because I have six months of expenses saved up.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.620]   And I'm out of debt.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.540]   And it stuck with me.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.180]   I remember things very easily when I hear them
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.140]   and it stuck with me.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.800]   And so I remember I was so shocked
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.900]   when I was getting laid off.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.020]   I'm sitting there looking at the president of the company
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.140]   and the executive vice president or whomever.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.180]   I'm sitting there looking at them.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.140]   And at first I didn't understand what was happening.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.380]   I had no concept that I was being laid off.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.620]   And then I realized I was being laid off
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.100]   and they were very solemnly going through
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.100]   and saying whatever their politically,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.580]   oh, we can't, I don't know what their political stuff was,
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.540]   you know, that HR cover your butt stuff.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.100]   And finally I realized I'm being laid off and I just,
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.500]   I laughed and I said to their face, I went,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.140]   "How big's the severance pay?"
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.900]   And they both looked at me.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.420]   I still remember, they both looked at me shocked at my joke
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.860]   and I immediately backpedaled and I said, "I'm sorry."
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.220]   And I explained that, "I'm sorry.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.580]   I just spent the last couple of years of my life
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.660]   getting out of debt.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.940]   I worked really hard and I've done nothing but save money.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.700]   And I, you know, just a few months ago,
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.620]   I saved six months worth of expenses."
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.420]   And that was, I did it to be prepared
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.260]   in case I ran into a significant financial problem like this.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.660]   And I explained that I heard Dave Ramsey say this thing
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.940]   about how big's the severance.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.460]   And so it diffused it, but that's how big of a difference.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.180]   That's how big of an impact war gaming
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.460]   can make on your life.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.540]   You might even just say verbatim what I just said.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.700]   But if you will think things through in advance
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.620]   of what would I do in that circumstance,
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.700]   you'll be prepared to move quickly.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.660]   So here are my questions for you.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.980]   That's what we're doing.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.940]   Thus, the scenario is simple.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.860]   You just got fired.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.420]   How would you cut your expenses immediately
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.160]   so that you could live on your income?
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.420]   If you're a dual income household,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.100]   how would you cut your expenses by 50%?
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.260]   What would you do?
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.420]   What would you cut?
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.620]   How would you get another job quickly?
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.780]   What would you do if both you and your spouse,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.820]   if you're a dual income household,
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.380]   if both of you came home and you said,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.500]   "Hey, I got news."
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.340]   And she says, "I've got news."
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.280]   And both of you lose your income.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.500]   How would you do that?
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.860]   Or if you're running a business,
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.500]   what would you do if your business revenues
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.540]   would decline by 50%?
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.460]   And I think 50% is a useful metric to use.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.340]   There's nothing precise or academic about it.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.020]   Just that it's a lot.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.460]   It's pretty severe to lose 50% of your income.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.580]   It's really severe.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.860]   It's a lot harder to figure that out
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.420]   than what would I do if I had a 10% cut.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.020]   You could have a 10% cut immediately,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.740]   but it's not so desperate as 0%.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.420]   So it gets you in the mindset of cutting.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.300]   It's also very useful to think about
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.940]   because many people might be able to,
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.260]   let's say you're gonna get laid off
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.500]   and you're concerned about it.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.620]   You might be able to negotiate
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.500]   simply taking a pay decrease.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.120]   Perhaps your company would like to keep you,
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.300]   but if you'll take a 35% pay cut, they'll keep you,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.900]   but they won't at your current salary.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.780]   So you might be able to keep some of your income.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.820]   It's also an important number
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.860]   because many people could replace 50% of their income
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.180]   through either taking another job quickly
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.700]   or through taking some kind of side work,
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.420]   side hustles, part-time work,
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.580]   putting together a mishmash of part-time jobs
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.460]   and just personal hustles in some way.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.380]   In general, it'd be unusual,
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.880]   you'd probably be pretty lazy
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.500]   to go from 100% of income to 0% of income
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.060]   and not be able to make anything.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.300]   So most people that are motivated and willing to work
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.040]   at doing whatever is available
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.740]   could at least make some money.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.120]   And so thinking 50% of my pay is gone,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.540]   how do I live on 50% puts you in the right mindset.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.980]   So I want you to think about that.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.940]   What would you do?
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.220]   How would you cut your expenses by 50% overnight?
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.340]   I want you to make a plan.
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.780]   I want you to imagine this through
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.860]   and ideally write it down.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.020]   The scenario is simple, you get fired.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.680]   And so just take a few minutes on your lunch break today
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.040]   and make an action checklist.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.760]   You go home, honey, I lost my job.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.500]   You walk to your home office and what do you do?
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.100]   Well, on the way maybe you crank the thermostat
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.940]   up a few degrees.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.740]   Sorry, we can't run the AC at 72 degrees,
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.660]   we gotta run it at 78
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.260]   because we can't afford the electricity bill
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.740]   or flip the AC off or the heater or whatever.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.700]   You pull out your cable bill, you call the cable company,
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.940]   you cancel the cable, you cancel Netflix,
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.620]   you cancel your subscription boxes,
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.580]   you cancel the cell phone plans.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.760]   We can't do $300 a month on our family plan of cell phones,
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.560]   we just can't do it, we cancel them.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.580]   By the way, if you're ever in that situation,
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.300]   that's one of the things, most people don't do that
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.820]   'cause they don't know how to keep their number.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.660]   You can do that by just simply porting your number
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.980]   either to a prepaid plan or what I recommend
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.740]   is port that number to something like Google Voice
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.020]   or some other solution where it's super cheap.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.780]   Google Voice charges either 10 or 20 bucks
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.860]   to port your number in,
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.280]   but then there's no more ongoing calls
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.900]   and you can swap your cell phone out all along the way.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.300]   It's one of the biggest savings that many people could have
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.340]   is going from two or $300 a month to $0 a month.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.180]   There have been many months where I've maintained
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.060]   a cell phone just through using apps,
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.340]   Google Voice, Voice over IP phones, MySudo,
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.620]   and then switching everything to messaging apps,
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.780]   whether that's WhatsApp, Facebook, Wire, Signal,
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.140]   that kind of thing.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.580]   By switching everything to messaging apps,
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.460]   you can cut your cell phone
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.780]   and that's a big one for many people
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.100]   when you got a family plan at $200 a month.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.420]   So you cancel the cell phone plans that day,
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.020]   you call the internet company and you say,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.020]   well, we're gonna have internet
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:54.840]   'cause I'm gonna be looking for work,
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.020]   but you drop the internet speeds to slow and cheap
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.020]   instead of fast and expensive like they are now.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.020]   You cancel the lawn service, you cancel the pool service,
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.220]   you cancel the house cleaner,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.460]   you cancel the kids tutors and the piano teachers,
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.140]   you call the kids private schools and tell them
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.540]   you're pulling them out at the end of the semester,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.860]   you're not gonna make next semester's premium payment
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.580]   or tuition payment.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.940]   You call your life insurance company
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.340]   and drop the additional premiums off
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.260]   your life insurance policies and drop them to the basics.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.540]   You cancel the restaurant budget,
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.100]   you drop the food budget by 50%,
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.720]   you say, we're going to basic foods, staple foods,
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.640]   cheap foods instead of the fancy pre-prepared foods
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.720]   that we normally enjoy eating.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.880]   You park the second car in the garage immediately,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.640]   you drop the insurance on it immediately
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.880]   'cause you park it.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.940]   You file for unemployment that day,
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.480]   you sign up for food stamps that day,
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.980]   you go to the food bank that evening
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.840]   and you get some food, et cetera.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.400]   The point is that plan out what you would do.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.080]   That's just cutting the tip of the iceberg.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.440]   I'm trying to use generic examples
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.080]   that would be broadly applicable.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.360]   But you look at your budget, you look at your expenses
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.720]   and say, I've got to cut my household expenses by 50%.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.520]   How do I do that?
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.960]   And the thing is, you want to be ruthless and move fast.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.880]   If you lose your job, be ruthless and move fast.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.600]   That is painful, but it's less painful
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.960]   to be ruthless and move fast than it is to kind of say,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   well, this is bad and I don't want to upset the family
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.480]   and I don't want to upset the family budget,
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.160]   I don't want the kids to be scared.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.100]   And so we're just going to wait and keep things as normal
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.000]   to try to maintain some semblance of normality.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Maybe I'm wrong on this, right?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.720]   Maybe 10 years from now when I'm dealing with teenagers,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.680]   I'll think differently as a parent.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.160]   But as a financial planner,
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.000]   I have watched this again and again and again.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.800]   And there's this idea that somehow parents are immune
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.600]   from circumstances and if they just hide from their children
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.200]   that things aren't going well, we just lost our job,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.040]   that things will be,
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.480]   that it'll help their emotional equilibrium.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.720]   I don't buy it.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.120]   I think emotional equilibrium is maintained
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.660]   by the quality of the relationship,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.020]   the confidence of the person.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.020]   And I think that children are perfectly capable
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.100]   of engaging and helping the family.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.560]   It may be that you say, son, I lost my job,
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.260]   you're out of private school, we're homeschooling,
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.220]   and what's more, you need a job this afternoon,
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.740]   let's go start, 'cause now you got to pay for your clothes.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.980]   That's fine, that's not child abuse.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.980]   And yet from a financial planning perspective,
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.500]   when people move slow,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.700]   they wind up paying for their slowness for years.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.960]   Giving you probably the hardest example.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.000]   You lose your job.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.940]   I think it's better for you to pull your children
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.080]   out of school, out of the private school immediately.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.740]   Finish the semester or whatever you have
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.980]   with the tuition you've paid up
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.780]   and then pull them out of school right away.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.740]   And so let's say you pull them out for the next semester.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.880]   It saves you the tuition payments.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.740]   That can be hard to predict based upon school payments,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.100]   but the point is you pull them out
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.420]   and you pull them home and you homeschool for a semester.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.180]   And then wind up two months later,
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.480]   you got a job, another job,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.380]   and you're in a situation now where you can easily make it,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.060]   well, put them right back into school.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.500]   They'll still have all their friends.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.060]   They just were at home for two months
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.420]   and make up the tuition payments
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.020]   and get them right back in two months later
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.300]   when you get a better job.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.180]   That is a far better scenario to be in
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.840]   than for you to say, well, I don't want to upset the kids.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.420]   And so we're just going to go ahead
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.500]   and put this semester's payment on the credit cards.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.020]   And then all of a sudden now you can't get a job.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.100]   The recession grows deeper and longer
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.700]   and you can't get a job because your industry is roiling
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.060]   and you weren't prepared to pivot to another industry.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.460]   And so now six months you're out of work
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.700]   and now you've got $15,000 of additional credit card debt
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.860]   for the kid's tuition payment.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.580]   And now you got to pull them out six months later.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.700]   And then it takes you another six months to find a job.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.460]   And now you've got to take six months, 12 months,
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.860]   18 months paying off your debt.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   As I talked about in a recent episode on the Back to Basics
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.780]   where I talked about the problem with debt,
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.700]   the problem of not moving slow
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.660]   is that you extend the pain to a long period of time.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.760]   If you followed my plan,
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.940]   you pulled the kids out immediately
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.300]   whenever your tuition runs out
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.540]   and you homeschool for two months,
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.500]   you can put them right back in.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.620]   You had two months of pain
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.860]   or maybe your kids had enjoyed two months of pleasure.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.540]   I don't know, sitting at home instead of going to school.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.560]   You had two months of pain versus two years of pain
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.980]   because you move too slow
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.100]   and you were super stressed the whole way through.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.400]   So be ruthless and move fast.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.860]   Next, resolve to move quickly
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.180]   and resolve to make at least enough income
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.020]   to keep your lean budget going forward.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.740]   Resolve to make enough to pay the basics
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.340]   and set those plans up now.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.260]   How would you do it?
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.420]   If you say, well, I'd go and drive for Uber
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.100]   or whatever the competitor is
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.820]   at the time that the recession comes,
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.220]   then make that plan now.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.540]   Research, make sure your car qualifies.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.940]   You may even go ahead and get signed up,
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.300]   become an Uber driver, get the inspection on your car
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   and drive once every month or two.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.860]   That way you're ready to go.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.160]   And so you lose your job,
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.860]   the next day you're in the car for 12 hours
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.100]   making $4.25 an hour.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.000]   But hey, $4.25 an hour
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.180]   might be enough to pay your mortgage bill.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.140]   So make that plan now.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.640]   If you're gonna do freelance consulting,
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.700]   then go ahead and keep those contacts alive.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.920]   Make contacts with the person and keep it ready
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.780]   so that you could, on your way home from your job,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.220]   you could call somebody and say,
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.660]   hey, I know you wanted me to do that gig
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.980]   and I didn't have time, but I just got laid off.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.540]   Can I start on this tomorrow?
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.380]   Keep things fresh.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.860]   Think now about how you generate
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.820]   some extra income from your house.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.940]   Would you rent out the spare bedroom?
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.540]   Would you move the kids into one bedroom
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.700]   and rent out the spare bedroom to somebody who needs it?
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.380]   Then make plans for it now.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.340]   Think about it now so that you're ready.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.300]   You may not wanna do it now
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.120]   'cause you don't need the money,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.220]   but hey, an extra $500 a month coming in
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.700]   from a part-time tenant
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.900]   could make a big, big difference for you.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.620]   Resolve to make at least enough income
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.380]   and resolve not to go backwards in the recession.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.220]   Don't borrow money.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.940]   Earn it.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:41.300]   I repeat, don't borrow money.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.780]   Earn it.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.840]   Again, back to the pain.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.680]   Problem with debt.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.700]   Go back and listen to that episode
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.180]   called "Back to Basics, The Problem with Debt,"
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.820]   something like that, about five, six, seven,
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.220]   eight episodes ago.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.900]   If you borrow money in a recession,
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.860]   you wind up coming out of the recession broke.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:03.420]   If you work and cut expenses in a worst-case scenario,
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.180]   you at least come out of the recession
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.580]   where you were before it.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.700]   And then as soon as you get well-employed again,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.020]   you can get back on track
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.820]   instead of having to spend a year or two years
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.760]   or three years making up for the recession.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.520]   This is the exact same problem that governments have
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.880]   and that the US government is going to have.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.320]   If the government would simply let,
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.880]   back to 2008,
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.800]   if the banks had simply been allowed to fail
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.280]   and all of the malinvestment
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.040]   and the badly placed capital
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.200]   had been allowed to be destroyed
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.840]   and taken care of through the markets
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.320]   and the courts and the bankruptcy process,
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.220]   the whole thing would have been over.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.860]   But because everyone said, "Oh, we're gonna bail it out,"
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.160]   it would have been a lot of short-term pain.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.180]   But within the bailouts,
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.180]   what we do is we extend the pain out
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.420]   and now it's decades and decades and decades of pain.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.140]   Take the pain, take the pain now,
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.720]   make it short, make it fast, make it deep,
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.860]   and then on the other side, rebuild.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.620]   So resolve not to go backwards in the recession.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.580]   Resolve to work at least enough part-time
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.860]   to make your way forward.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.860]   Don't go backwards, don't lose net worth.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.540]   You may not, let me rephrase that.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.160]   You may not be able to affect your net worth
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.500]   because your investments may go down
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.680]   in their current market value.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.420]   So you may not be able to keep from losing net worth,
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.740]   but don't go cash backwards.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.820]   Keep your cash cushion and work, earn,
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.020]   do whatever is necessary to keep going forward.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.300]   Don't go backwards.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.340]   Next action step.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.140]   If you see recession coming
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.660]   and you are preparing for recession,
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.620]   pay attention to the indicators
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.380]   and start stockpiling cash.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:50.360]   If today you would be in a difficult situation,
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.740]   if you lost your job,
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.880]   you need this to be stockpiling cash.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.840]   I gave this advice recently to a consulting client,
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.600]   was paying thousands of extra dollars a month
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.940]   towards a mortgage payment,
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.980]   very focused on getting the mortgage paid off
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.300]   in a couple of years.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.300]   I said, "Good job, stop, stockpile cash."
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.260]   Didn't have enough cash,
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.140]   didn't have enough in emergency fund,
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.580]   and was too much at risk of losing the job.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.980]   And if he'd lost his job,
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.420]   it would have been potentially very, very difficult.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.140]   So stockpile cash.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.660]   You may not be able to predict with certainty
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.480]   when the next recession is,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.220]   but when there are giant yellow lights
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.060]   flashing all over the economy,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.740]   when there are giant yellow lights and this says,
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.580]   "Hey, this is the inverted yield curve."
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.280]   And we got the interest rates of 90 day T-bills
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.040]   above 30 year bonds,
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.980]   that is a giant warning light for imminent recession
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.720]   in the coming year, months, years.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.500]   But you have enough time to stockpile cash.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.600]   So stockpile cash.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.180]   If you are not currently stockpiling cash
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.940]   and you're not currently in a very comfortable situation,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.100]   significant investments, significant cash stockpiles,
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.180]   fully funded emergency funds, et cetera,
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.060]   this is your time to prepare.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.140]   Stop paying extra on debt.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.780]   As long as your debt is at reasonable interest rates,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.620]   paying 25% debt, credit cards, things like that,
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.180]   stop paying extra on debt.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.320]   Now, keep your momentum towards your debt-freeness,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.700]   but stockpile your cash instead.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.980]   And it'd be much better for you
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.420]   to stockpile cash for a year,
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.780]   and then all of a sudden all the yellow lights go away.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.120]   Eh, it was once again,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.660]   the economists were predicting recessions
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.860]   and it was, eh, President Trump fixed it all, right?
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.220]   So at that point in time,
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.860]   you just go ahead and take the cash and pay off your debts.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.220]   What was your cost?
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.540]   Well, your cost was 12 months worth of interest payments
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.700]   in that situation.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.520]   That's why I say,
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.220]   as long as your debt is at reasonable interest rates.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.100]   What is the actual cost of that?
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.540]   In most cases, not much.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.640]   Most listen to the show, that wouldn't be all that much
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.700]   compared to the safety of having that 12 months of cash.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.540]   So stockpile cash,
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.360]   stop paying extra on your debt and pile it up.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.480]   You can always take the cash and pay off your debt,
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.180]   but you can't always easily borrow more money
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.360]   in the middle of a recession.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.960]   Stockpile cash.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   Next, refinance now any debt
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.080]   that is not intelligently set up
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.240]   for long-term low-cost maintenance.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   This is the time to refinance.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.840]   This is the time, back to that 50%.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.000]   Let me give you a real problem.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.980]   How would you solve this?
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.700]   Your household budget is currently $5,000 a month.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.680]   Your monthly mortgage payment is $2,000 per month.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.140]   And you have other expenses.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.420]   You have utilities, you have food,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.940]   just basic expenses of life.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.580]   And so I say to you, how do you cut your budget by 50%?
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.420]   I give you $2,500 a month.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.300]   So you go through and you say,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.460]   well, I could drop my electrical expense by 30%.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.340]   That would save me $37.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.900]   We could lower our food expenses by $200 a month.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.980]   And you go through all this math
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.380]   with all these little frugality things
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.340]   and you look at it and you say,
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.420]   but the reality is there's no way
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.980]   we could adjust our budget to go from $5,000 a month
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:12.420]   to $2,500 a month 'cause I got a $2,000 mortgage payment.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.220]   You're right, you can't do it.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.620]   It's not gonna be possible for you.
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.900]   But what you can do is refinance your mortgage.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:24.340]   So if you have 12 years left on your mortgage
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.980]   and you're in a situation, you say,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.460]   well, I got a $2,000 monthly mortgage payment.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.380]   Now's not a bad time to refinance your mortgage.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.580]   So refinance your mortgage to a 30-year payment.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:39.580]   Drop your monthly payment from $2,000 to $1,100.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.160]   But if you want, either stockpile the cash now,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.980]   but stay focused and pay that thing off fast,
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.120]   but make a $2,000 monthly payment.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.860]   What you've done in that situation
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.540]   is you've increased your safety
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.780]   because you've lowered your mortgage payment.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.740]   So you lower your mortgage payment
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.900]   by extending the terms, that buys you more time.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.940]   Now you can live on less money,
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.420]   but you can still pay the mortgage off fast.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.640]   Now today, that's probably pretty easy for you to do
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.620]   because you are well-employed.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.160]   But the day you lose your job
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.060]   and you call up a mortgage broker
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.980]   and say, I'd like to refinance my mortgage,
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.500]   and they say, what's your income?
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.140]   $0.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.020]   That is a whole lot harder to do.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.500]   It's tough to refinance a mortgage
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.180]   when you're unemployed and current.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.980]   Yes, you can go behind on your mortgage,
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.860]   miss months of payments,
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.260]   and then they might work with you
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.940]   and rejigger the mortgage for you.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.740]   But you don't wanna do that.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.760]   So refinance your mortgage now.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:42.120]   And that cash may be extremely valuable for you.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.040]   In a moment, we'll talk about bankruptcy planning,
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.980]   just a second.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.160]   But pulling that cash and that equity out,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.020]   as long as you're not an idiot and spend it,
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.980]   can be very much within your best interest.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.500]   Talk about that in a moment.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.180]   Remember, you can always pay down a mortgage again
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.740]   as long as you have the cash and you haven't spent it.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:03.920]   So set aside the cash and stockpile the cash,
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.100]   refinance the mortgage until you're in a position
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.000]   where you can just simply pay it off.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.180]   If you can show a check and pay off the mortgage,
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.380]   that can be a great thing to do
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.780]   because now you have the house debt-free.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.540]   And now you don't have any monthly payment coming out,
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.860]   which is very safe.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.220]   But if you got 12 years of payments coming out
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.580]   and $2,000 a month that you owe,
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.260]   and you don't have a huge amount of savings,
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.460]   that could be a very precarious situation
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.420]   because you can't make a $2,000 a month
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.500]   mortgage payment driving for Uber.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.060]   But you could make a $1,200 a month
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.740]   mortgage payment driving for Uber.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.520]   So refinance any debt that isn't properly set up
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.580]   for easy, comfortable, long-term maintenance.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.740]   This is the time also to refinance your credit card debts.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.720]   It's much easier to do what I teach
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.860]   in my credit card course, to apply for higher,
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.620]   you can get easily approved for much higher credit limits
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.460]   when you can report income.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.620]   But the day you lose your job
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.980]   and you have to fill out that application
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.180]   that says what's your annual income,
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:04.180]   and now you say, "Oh, well, it was $150,000,
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.100]   "and today it's zero."
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.700]   Whole lot easier to get more credit limit
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.460]   when you got $150,000 income
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.060]   that you can honestly, truthfully report than $0.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.940]   So maybe you use the cash from your mortgage refi,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.680]   take my credit card course, refi,
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.220]   take the cash, pay off your credit cards,
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.160]   raise your credit score, and then re-borrow the money
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.740]   at 0%, they're much more favorable terms,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.420]   stack the excess capital up in a bank account,
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.380]   and have it available to you
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.780]   to pay off the credit cards again or pay off the mortgage.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.760]   So take my credit card course,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.020]   or at least listen to all the free shows
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.700]   I put out a year ago when I launched that course,
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.000]   and you'll get the idea of some ways to do it.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.420]   So refinance any debt that isn't intelligently
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.140]   and comfortably set up for the long-term.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.540]   Take a look at every bit of debt that you have.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.060]   Next, protect your assets.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.580]   This is the time to do pre-bankruptcy planning.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.640]   Do it now.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.400]   This is the time to do pre-bankruptcy planning.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.740]   Most people who wind up in bankruptcy
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.940]   never expected to be there.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.100]   Yes, some of them made foolish decisions
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.780]   where they said, "I'll have this great thing,"
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.360]   and they just didn't think.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.340]   But many people wind up in bankruptcy
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.900]   through circumstances that they didn't anticipate.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.020]   A recession came along
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.860]   right when they had a major health crisis,
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.020]   and now all of a sudden, they're deeply in debt,
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.740]   and they wind up in bankruptcy.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.800]   This is the time to do pre-bankruptcy planning.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.380]   So sit down, take all my shows that I did
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.560]   on credit or asset protection for,
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.860]   can't even remember,
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.400]   you know you have bad show titles
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.300]   when you can't even remember the names of your own shows.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.140]   Asset protection for mere mortals.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.360]   The whole series of show,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.700]   I work back and forth with bankruptcy planning.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.940]   Read a book on bankruptcy planning.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:41.780]   You can do it yourself.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.660]   Consult with a bankruptcy planning attorney,
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.040]   and do pre-bankruptcy planning when everything is good,
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.900]   when you're well-employed, et cetera.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.540]   This is the time to think about what would happen
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.040]   if this recession forced me into bankruptcy.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.380]   See, we get used to three-month recessions,
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.500]   six-month recessions, year-long recessions.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.660]   What if the next recession is three years long?
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.720]   What if it's twice as bad as the one in 2008?
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.460]   What if that was the great recession,
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.380]   and now this is the greatest recession?
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.640]   Are you prepared?
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.300]   Do pre-bankruptcy planning now.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   So what do you do?
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.340]   Well, you re-finance, let's say in the mortgage example,
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.580]   you have 12 years left on your mortgage,
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.700]   $2,000 monthly payment,
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.220]   normal household income, $5,000 per month.
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.780]   Pretend you don't live in a state
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.980]   that protects 100% of your homestead.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.240]   You don't live in Florida.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.200]   You don't live in Texas.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.540]   You don't live in Kansas.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.820]   You live in Georgia or North Carolina,
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.220]   where they give you this measly little
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.460]   $15,000 homestead exemption.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.980]   Well, what I say is in that situation,
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.460]   re-finance your mortgage.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.660]   Re-finance it to strip the equity off the homestead,
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.900]   and make sure that this year you fully fund your 401(k),
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.340]   fully fund your IRA.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.120]   If you're worried about market declines,
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.020]   just keep the money in a cash account inside your 401(k),
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.160]   inside your Roth IRAs, et cetera.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.220]   But the money in your 401(k), your Roth IRA,
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.820]   depending on the bankruptcy laws of your state,
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.740]   should be protected in bankruptcy.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.140]   And so it's a very safe place for you to keep it,
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.420]   whereas the money in your home is not protected.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.860]   Now, if you live in Florida, Texas, Kansas, et cetera,
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.880]   some of the states that are generous
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.180]   with homestead exemptions,
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.960]   then that advice is different.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.220]   But you still maximize your 401(k),
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.280]   and in that situation, make sure that you maximize
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.420]   the amount of equity in your house,
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.460]   because now that's protected.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.620]   So do the pre-bankruptcy planning in your state now.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.620]   Fund your 529 plans, fund your health savings accounts
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:29.900]   if they're protected in your states.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.500]   Let's say your state gives you
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.940]   bankruptcy protection on one car.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.780]   Well, pay off the one car that you'd keep
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.920]   that comes in within the appropriate values
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.980]   for your state's bankruptcy laws,
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.480]   and then just pay minimums on the second.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.600]   Take some of the cash from a non-bankruptcy-protected
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.640]   account and stock the pantry full of canned goods
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.900]   and long-lasting food that would see your family fed
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.320]   in difficult times.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.120]   Pay minimum payments on the credit cards,
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.600]   but maximize your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.400]   This is the time to do bankruptcy planning
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.820]   when you're long away from it,
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.740]   when you don't think it could ever happen.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.520]   Now, what's the worst that could happen?
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.960]   Well, worst that could happen is, of course,
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.260]   that three years you're into a recession,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.520]   you've been unemployed for two years,
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.180]   and you wind up in bankruptcy court.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.740]   Well, you're gonna be happy with the advice
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.160]   that I've just given you.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.120]   But in a better situation,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.080]   yeah, you don't even lose your job.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:21.920]   What do you do?
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.680]   You don't lose your job, you continue stockpiling cash,
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.400]   you're out and already you have enough money
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.160]   to comfortably pay off the house,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.600]   you refinance, you just keep things going.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.220]   And when the recession indicators lift,
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.180]   your career seems very stable,
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.320]   you've got plenty of money, plenty of savings,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   just simply pay it off.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.320]   You paid a few thousand dollars of mortgage interest,
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.520]   hopefully paid relatively almost close to zero
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.560]   on your credit cards, car payment, whatever.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.760]   Protect yourself.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.300]   I'm not advocating for you to borrow money.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.120]   I'm not advocating for you to go into debt.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.280]   I'm advocating for you, if you're in debt,
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.800]   to be intelligent and understand the law.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.040]   This is the time, when you're not anywhere near bankruptcy,
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.720]   to do pre-bankruptcy planning
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.640]   in the preparation for the unfortunate circumstance
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.160]   of three years from now, you wind up in bankruptcy court.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.080]   You don't wanna be there
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.180]   and not have maximized your opportunities.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.520]   Now, the other reason for you
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.680]   to be doing what I'm encouraging you,
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.920]   stockpile cash, refinance debt, et cetera,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.520]   is to prepare for opportunities.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.880]   If you see recession coming,
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.420]   yes, you want to be defensive, correct,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.240]   but you also wanna be prepared
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.920]   to take advantage of opportunities.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.880]   So as the recession nears, as you see signs,
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.560]   start cutting expenses and stockpiling cash
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.640]   to free up money for either making good use
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.840]   of the recession for your personal benefit
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.200]   or to free up money for your investment.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.320]   Let's talk about personal benefit before investment.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:55.000]   Think now about how you would creatively use the recession
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.200]   for your personal benefit,
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.800]   to advance you in the direction that you desire to go.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   I'll give you an example.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.280]   Pretend that I'm working a job.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.520]   It's good, it provides for me,
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.280]   but it's not necessarily what's been on my dream list,
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.100]   but it has seemed irresponsible for me to quit my job
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.800]   at this point in time.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.340]   But I've always had a dream
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.240]   of starting a publishing business.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.680]   I've always had a dream of starting a media business
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.320]   or something online, et cetera.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.480]   And I'm using that just to give an extreme example here.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.600]   Maybe I've always had a dream
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.800]   of starting a carpentry business
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.440]   or opening a restaurant or a coffee shop
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.300]   or a plumbing business, whatever your thing is.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.040]   I'm just using an extreme example for fun.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:40.040]   So it's never seemed intelligent for me to quit my job,
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.240]   but I recognize that I don't necessarily
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.840]   wanna do this forever.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.300]   But I've got a mortgage, I've got a car payment,
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.760]   I've got some credit card debt,
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.920]   and my kids are in private school,
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.800]   and that's important to me.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.120]   So now I go in, boss says, "Sorry, buddy,
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   today's your last day."
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.160]   I lose my job.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.800]   And my industry is in turmoil,
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.600]   employment's down or unemployment's up,
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.520]   sales are down.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.840]   And I just think, you know what?
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.680]   I'm probably not gonna get another job in my industry.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.640]   So what would I do in that situation?
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   Well, conveniently, of course,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.760]   I've tailored my example to fit my radical personality,
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.000]   but here's what I would do.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.860]   I would immediately pack up my stuff
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.940]   and I would rent out my house.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.640]   I would sell all my cars
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.760]   to pay off as much of the car payments as I possibly could.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.320]   I would pull my children out of private school
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.940]   and I would use the money from the sale of the cars
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.120]   or my savings or whatever,
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.680]   and I'd fly my family to Thailand.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.200]   I'd rent an apartment in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.880]   I'd homeschool my children,
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.280]   and I would work day and night
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.800]   to start my publishing business.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.940]   Because with that move,
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.880]   I've probably just adjusted my budget,
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.040]   my household monthly budget,
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.680]   from $5,000 a month
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.320]   to being able to live on $1,000 a month,
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.720]   including a perfectly nice place,
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.480]   beautiful beach, lots of food,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.800]   just because of the change of the costs of living.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.200]   Now, in that situation, how do I do it?
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.640]   Well, remember, most people,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.440]   we're talking about normal situations,
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.480]   most normal houses can be rented out at high enough rates
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.740]   to cover the mortgage payment with some extra.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.360]   Maybe you had that house
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.560]   where your monthly mortgage payment was $2,000 a month,
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.200]   but by refinancing now,
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.400]   you've dropped your monthly mortgage payment to $1,200 a month
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.520]   and you've freed up several tens of thousands of dollars
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.120]   of extra cash, which you've then gone ahead
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.320]   and stuffed into your 401(k) and your Roth IRA
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.040]   to do good bankruptcy planning in place
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.160]   and have some protection,
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.200]   and you keep a bunch of extra money
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.000]   in your checking account as well.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.960]   I'm not saying don't have money in your checking account,
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.680]   but now your mortgage payment is $1,200.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.960]   Well, most houses in that range
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.680]   could probably be rented out for 1,800 to $2,200 a month
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.080]   across the, at fair market rents across the country,
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.040]   sometimes higher, but very comfortably.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   So you rent out your house for $2,000 a month
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.480]   and you got a $1,200 mortgage payment.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.700]   Selling the car, so that creates $800 of income
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.620]   that I didn't have previously.
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.660]   Because I had to pay that mortgage payment of $1,200,
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.300]   but now I rent the house out,
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.100]   I've got 800 extra dollars of income.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.140]   Selling the cars clears out a massive monthly outflow.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.460]   Maybe I had two car payments at $400 a piece.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.580]   Oh, I sell both of them.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.540]   Now I've dropped my expenses by $800.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.800]   I've also possibly freed up some equity
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.380]   that was locked in that car that can be put to better use.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.180]   By moving to a place where I don't need a car,
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.060]   I can easily bum around on a scooter
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.580]   or hitch a ride on the rickshaw and pay a taxi.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.260]   It's very affordable, take Uber, whatever.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.980]   But I've freed up, I don't even need a car.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.540]   So I don't have to solve that problem anymore.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.500]   So I've lowered my expenses,
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.820]   both now by clearing the car payments,
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.900]   and I've moved to a place where I don't need the car.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.000]   Now, I surf my credit cards around
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.420]   with small minimum payments, keep all that at 0%.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.500]   Just keep that stable, but keep those payments current.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.740]   And now with my big move to Thailand,
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:55.100]   I've lowered my cost of living from $5,000 a month
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.420]   to $1,000 a month, because of moving
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.760]   from a high cost of living place
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.300]   to a low cost of living place.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.740]   My rent, instead of paying $1,200 a month
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.420]   on a mortgage payment, my rent is $400 a month
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.460]   for a two bedroom, three bedroom on the beach.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.820]   My food expenses dropped massively.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.220]   I can eat out my whole family for $300 a month.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.380]   We've probably potentially dropped other expenses.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.700]   Maybe you don't need health insurance
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:23.540]   because you're in a place where the cost of doctor bills,
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.580]   et cetera, is not nearly so catastrophic
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.140]   as the United States.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.420]   So I can drop my health insurance.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.260]   That saves me $900 a month
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.960]   that I would be paying with COBRA.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.980]   There'll also be a massive change in my taxes.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.020]   Pretend I've got two or three children.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.620]   Well, if my income goes from,
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.960]   say it was $120,000 per year before, and now it's zero,
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.980]   all of a sudden this year,
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.340]   instead of paying $30,000 of income taxes,
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.620]   I'm gonna get some nice big fat child tax credits
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:59.540]   and earned income tax credits back on my tax returns.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.540]   And yet I can still live on this lower amount.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.520]   I've got $800 a month of cash flow
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.380]   from renting out my house.
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:12.380]   And now with extra savings, freeing up some cash,
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.620]   I just need another couple $300 a month
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.100]   for a couple $300 a month from my
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   (smacks lips)
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.780]   savings, just pulling from my savings to cover me.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.500]   So then I pour myself into the business,
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.740]   get the business really building successfully.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.780]   It takes me two years.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.060]   I bring it back to three, $4,000.
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:32.900]   We call up our tenants,
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.340]   say you're out at the end of this year,
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.380]   and we fly back from Thailand.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.720]   The biggest added expense of that is plane tickets.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.100]   And in my example, you had to want to move to Thailand.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.860]   Now, I've used an extreme example
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.220]   just to show you what can happen
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.820]   if you think ahead about this.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.700]   Some of you would hear that example and say,
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.980]   why didn't I think of that?
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.500]   That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.260]   And some of you are looking at that and saying,
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.300]   I've always wanted to start an online publishing business,
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.700]   and now you've just showed me how I can do it.
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.340]   I chose Chiang Mai because there's a bunch of,
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.940]   it's kind of an internet entrepreneur hotspot
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.420]   in today's world.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.380]   But some of you listen to that and say,
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.900]   I'd never moved to Thailand.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.260]   But think about what you would do.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.660]   That can be done locally.
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:19.060]   That kind of movement can be done locally.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.820]   And so now you can have the opportunity
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.980]   to use a recession and a job layoff.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.820]   That's what I was forgetting.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.020]   You got severance pay.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:30.340]   So I've just taken your months of severance pay,
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.740]   and I've stretched it out where previously
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:36.060]   you're gonna get $4,000 a month of severance pay
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.140]   for six months.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.580]   Well, that $24,000 was only barely gonna keep you
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.140]   in your house for six months.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:46.060]   Whereas now that $24,000 mixed with the cost
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.500]   of renting your income out gives you,
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.220]   even after plane tickets to Thailand,
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.900]   $4,000 to plane tickets,
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.180]   that still now gives you two years of runway
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.300]   where you don't have to make a dime in your new business
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.940]   for the next two years.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.540]   And so you invest in your business,
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.260]   take those business expenses, keep your taxes really low,
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.020]   maximize your refundable tax credits in the United States,
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.580]   and now I've freed up extra money
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.460]   and we've got three years of runway.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.460]   And you can build the business,
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:13.060]   keep it very, very profitable,
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.820]   enjoy hanging out on a Thai beach,
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:18.220]   taking your kids all over on scooter tours of Thailand,
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.460]   enjoy learning Thai, it's a wonderful place.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:24.740]   So, but it can also be done locally.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.420]   You don't have to go to Thailand.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.660]   I've done this, I've taught people how to do this
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.820]   in the United States.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.580]   I had a consulting client one time,
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.980]   got laid off from a very high level job.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:38.500]   Their entire life and their entire lifestyle and structure
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.580]   was built around this high paying, high status job
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.300]   in a major metropolitan city.
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.700]   Well, they got laid off
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.340]   and they got an extremely generous severance package,
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:52.060]   but that severance package wouldn't have gone all that far
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.020]   in that high paying metropolitan city.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:58.620]   Convince them to get rid of their stuff, buy an RV,
[00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.660]   they'd always wanted to write a book,
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.460]   convince them to write a book and to adjust.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.020]   And now that one year of severance
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.940]   turned into three years of runway to make this life change.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.340]   And you can always get another job.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.780]   You can always get another high paying job
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.700]   and move back into the high status lifestyle,
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:17.300]   but you can use a recession as an opportunity in your life.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.540]   You can use severance pay as an opportunity
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.260]   to start the new business, buy the subway franchise,
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.180]   do, you know, build the, write the book,
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.100]   become a public speaker, become a circus performer,
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.380]   what, become a meditation guru, I don't know.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.820]   You can do it, you can do it locally.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.740]   You don't have to go to Thailand.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.260]   You can do it right in the United States.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.780]   You can do it right in downtown Chicago.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.900]   Next, if there's a recession,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.220]   think about what deals you may be able to get
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.900]   that would fit your personal desired goals.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:51.300]   Always wanted to buy an RV, too expensive.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.300]   People start selling RVs in recessions
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.100]   because they got to dump their monthly payment.
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.520]   You step in, take over their loan even,
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.300]   but solve their problem for them,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.740]   take their RV off their hands,
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.500]   you've solved their problem, get yourself a nice deal.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.060]   Always wanted to buy a boat.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.940]   You can get some really nice deals
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.980]   a couple of years into a recession.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.980]   Always wanted to go on a cruise.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.580]   Well, the time to do it is a couple of years
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.940]   into a recession.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.580]   Do your buying when people are hurting
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.380]   so that you can get your deals.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.220]   Do your selling when people are doing well.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.580]   So plan ahead and free up the cash
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.940]   so that you're in a position
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.980]   to take advantage of the recession.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.340]   And then finally, this is the time for you
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.900]   to prepare for investment opportunity.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.180]   Recessions, depressions, generally create
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.180]   buying opportunities for those who are prepared,
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.980]   for those who have an idea, for those who have money,
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.420]   for those who have a plan,
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.400]   and for those who have the clarity of purpose to move.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.900]   Now, that might be buying stocks.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.620]   You wanna be, maybe you do this in your 401k.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.060]   You pull your money out and you're sitting there waiting.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.020]   And that day when all your fellow coworkers,
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.700]   you hear just the listening over the wall of the cubicle,
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.780]   man, I sold, I got out.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.840]   That's the day you click buy and you move back in.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.520]   So maybe it's buying stocks.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.020]   There are throughout history, many investors
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.460]   who made their mark buying stocks
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.540]   when everything was bad.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.900]   My favorite is John Templeton.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.900]   He started in the midst of the Great Depression
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.460]   buying companies that were considered worthless.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.940]   So maybe it's stocks.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.820]   Maybe it's real estate.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.380]   You can come in during,
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.220]   usually real estate seems to decline
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.220]   a couple of years after a recession starts.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.620]   People start, they lose their jobs
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:40.620]   and there's an ongoing cycle.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.540]   People lose their jobs and they start getting behind
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.380]   on their mortgage payments.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.900]   Then they move in foreclosure.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:46.580]   And now you may be able to come in,
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.580]   take over the mortgage, negotiate short sales,
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.820]   negotiate purchases, a whole long world into that.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.540]   But it's a really great time to get started
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.780]   building your investment portfolio
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.580]   when you come in in the middle of a recession.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.060]   The trick is you either gotta have cash
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.700]   or have access to cash.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.140]   So that's the time to do it.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:09.060]   Maybe it's starting and buying a new business
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.700]   or expanding one.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.740]   You can get great deals on rents
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.020]   because in the middle of the recession,
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.380]   landlord was renting out this storefront space
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.160]   for $2,500 a month, but he drops to $1,500 a month
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.420]   because he cannot stand to have his strip mall vacant.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.020]   That just makes everything go down.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.680]   So you come in and you get a very significant discount
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.900]   on renting his space, or you start a business on the side
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.500]   and all the new tools of your business are super cheap
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.300]   because the competitors are going into bankruptcy.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.020]   Whatever your investment opportunities are,
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.660]   whatever your investment plans are,
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.340]   plan ahead and try to be prepared
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.340]   to take advantage of them in a recession.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.240]   I close out with this.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.860]   I don't think that you should wait on a recession
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.980]   in order to pursue your plans.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.260]   If you're ready to go now to invest in real estate
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.640]   and you find a deal that fits your parameters, buy.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.780]   If you're ready to start a business
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.340]   and you're ready to make that transition now, go.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.300]   Make the transition.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:12.000]   But if it just so happens that the recession aligns
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.140]   with your personal movements,
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.320]   and if it just so happens that you're ready
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   to buy real estate and then a recession comes along,
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.220]   make it happen.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.740]   This is the time.
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.540]   Don't miss the opportunity.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.260]   What does Rahm Emanuel say?
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.820]   Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.420]   Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.520]   This is your chance.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:40.420]   I am concerned, significantly concerned,
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:45.180]   about the potential for recession in the United States
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.260]   in the coming months and years.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.620]   It will be fascinating to see how it works out.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.900]   If the recession arrives soon,
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.820]   it's arriving much later than I thought it would.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.980]   So I was wrong on my previous predictions.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.260]   I thought we'd be in recession in 2017.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:06.740]   I thought we'd be in recession in 2018.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.740]   Here we are in 2019, we haven't been in recession.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:16.020]   But just because I was wrong in my personal guesses
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:20.200]   doesn't mean that I was hurt by preparing for recession.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.100]   I'm convinced this is the secret to good planning,
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.900]   is be positioned as best you can for different things.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.900]   Now you can't be positioned for all markets
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.660]   and all opportunities and be optimized
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.300]   for every one of those.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.140]   If you are stockpiling cash, preparing for a recession,
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.300]   and you're not paying off debt,
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.220]   yes, you are paying more interest.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.760]   You are using up time, perhaps.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.940]   But that cost is probably pretty low
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.060]   compared to the opportunities.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.940]   So I'm convinced that there's a very decent chance
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.060]   that recession is coming soon,
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.420]   which is why I'm trying to seek to prepare you.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:02.980]   But I haven't sat around and waited on,
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.780]   I haven't sat around and waited on recession
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.620]   to move forward, and I don't think you should either.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.460]   If you think back to the recommendations I've made,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.020]   what you'll see is that, ironically,
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.820]   many of these things apply just as much
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.620]   in boom times as in bust times.
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.100]   I'm just trying to leverage the news and the concern,
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.700]   et cetera, to try to get your attention
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.540]   to break through with some plans.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.080]   I do think it's worth it to prepare for recession,
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.300]   but the time to prepare for recession
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.220]   is when things are going well.
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.400]   If you're gonna be a contrarian,
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.620]   then you've gotta think differently.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.740]   So you prepare for recession when everything is going well.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:45.940]   And then when everybody else is freaking out,
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.060]   that's the time that you're Mr. Optimist,
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.060]   going all in on your plans for optimism.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:55.220]   And if you can cultivate the psychology
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.820]   and then buttress that psychology
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.500]   with some good, useful, technical planning ideas,
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.300]   et cetera, like hopefully I've given you a handful today,
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.440]   then I think you're positioned well for success.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.280]   I am grateful that you are here.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.400]   I would strongly encourage you,
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.980]   if your personal finances are not robust
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.960]   and prepared for recession, you have time.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.760]   If you are not well-employed right now,
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.440]   I don't know what you're waiting on.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.060]   Unemployment at record low levels, this is the time.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.960]   So get busy.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.320]   If you've got three months or six months
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.280]   of preparation time or a year, whatever, whatever,
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.280]   I don't know, I'm trying to stay away from prognostications.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.960]   If you've got three months, six months, or a year,
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.780]   and you use that effectively,
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:49.280]   then you'll be positioned to win in the next recession.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.320]   That's what I want for you.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.840]   So think carefully.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.160]   If you've got additional suggestions, contributions,
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.360]   then go ahead and share those with me here.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.760]   As I close, I would just really encourage you,
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.040]   I have two courses currently on the market.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.760]   I've pulled my career and income planning course
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.520]   off the market because it conflicts
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.880]   with something else that I'm doing.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.920]   But I have two courses available on the market.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.960]   Both of these courses are ideally suited
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.160]   for preparing for recession.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.600]   If you have not taken my courses, I ask you to do it.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.880]   It is worth your money and worth your time
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.360]   to take my courses.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.240]   I offer an unconditional money-back guarantee
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.640]   if you don't think it was worth your time
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.680]   and worth your money.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:35.520]   I have had almost no returns or requests for a refund
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.320]   on those two courses out of many, many students.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.640]   They are good.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.280]   If you liked any of the ideas in this show,
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.840]   you will like the ideas in those courses.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.360]   The first one that I'm offering right now
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.000]   is called "How to Borrow Money Safely
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.360]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards."
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.280]   Most people use credit cards wrong.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.600]   And they use credit cards as an emergency mechanism
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.320]   instead of properly understanding the system
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.920]   so that they can exploit it to their benefit.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.360]   Credit cards can be a wonderful tool for you
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.880]   if you know what you're doing
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.560]   and if you can exercise proper self-control
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.920]   so that you don't wind up spending money on consumption.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.040]   But if you have a credit card today
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.840]   or you think you might ever have a credit card
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.380]   in the future, I would ask you
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.760]   to please consider taking my course.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.640]   I can potentially save you thousands and thousands
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.100]   and thousands of dollars on interest payments
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.280]   if you actually understand how to do the market,
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.200]   how the market works.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.360]   Give you a very simple example.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.960]   I did this recently with a consulting client.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.760]   I have a consulting client, runs a very large business
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.720]   and uses credit cards in his business
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.000]   and generally has a six-figure balance month to month
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.720]   but pays it off month to month.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.960]   But he was annoyed, has a perfect payment history,
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.280]   uses six figures of credit every single month,
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.160]   but he's got a credit score, I forget the exact number,
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.000]   but it was,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.280]   it was 686.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.720]   He had a 686 credit score, FICO score.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   It was frustrating.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.640]   Why do I have a 686 FICO score
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.000]   when I have a perfect credit history,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.160]   great mix of credit, long, never missed a payment, et cetera.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.520]   Why do I have a 686 FICO score?
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.800]   Well, it's because he's got a six-figure balance
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.520]   on a monthly basis with all the money that's going through.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.680]   Now, he has one simple practice.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.240]   He uses a credit card and then on the day
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.560]   that the credit card payment comes in,
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.120]   he strokes a check and pays it off.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.440]   Sorry, the day the bill comes in,
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   he strokes a check and pays it off.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.720]   So he pays off his credit card balance every single month.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.880]   But here's the trick that most people don't recognize.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.280]   The balance that's reported to the credit reporting agencies,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.360]   which is the data that's used to make your credit score,
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.960]   is the balance that you have on the date,
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.280]   the closing date of your statement.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.720]   So if you've got $100,000 balance on your credit cards
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.760]   and that balance is,
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.880]   and then they close the statement,
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.080]   then they send you your bill and then you pay it,
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.520]   you're reported as having $100,000 balance
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.440]   to the credit agencies.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.640]   I made one simple suggestion.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.480]   I said, very simply,
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.440]   this month, write your $100,000 check
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.400]   on the day before the statement closes.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.100]   So he did it.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:20.960]   The day before the statement closed,
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.160]   instead of a week later,
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.400]   he just wrote the $100,000 check,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.640]   paid off the balance,
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.400]   and thus the balance that was reported
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   to the credit agency was zero.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.340]   That month, after that was filtered through
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:34.640]   to the credit reporting agencies,
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.720]   his FICO score was 788.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.560]   He had over a hundred point increase in his FICO score
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.500]   from one little silly detail,
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.880]   one silly thing.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.000]   And that helped him immeasurably
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.880]   to do some other refinancing that he was working on,
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.080]   because being able to simply show a 788 FICO score
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.640]   makes a huge difference rather than a 686.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.360]   There was no factoring of interest.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.740]   There was no, he wasn't paying interest.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.680]   He was paying it off before interest was due.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.340]   There was no factoring of being in debt.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:08.380]   He wasn't in debt.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:12.420]   He was simply using the credit cards in his business.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.060]   But the weeks different of the date of writing a check
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.420]   made a hundred point increase in his FICO score.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.020]   Now, that's just the tip of the iceberg
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.740]   of what's available with credit cards.
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.620]   But the key time that you establish
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.900]   a credit card infrastructure that helps you
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.200]   is when you don't need it.
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.060]   When you don't need it at all.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.460]   When you're well-employed,
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.500]   when there's no recession, et cetera.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.400]   But the time that that helps you
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.660]   is when you lose your job, when there's a recession,
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.460]   when you're trying to take advantage of opportunity,
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.780]   et cetera.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.820]   So consider taking my course,
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:45.880]   How to Borrow Money Safely
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.100]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.460]   If you've already taken that course,
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.540]   I think I'm selling, I can't remember,
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.420]   40 bucks, 50 bucks, it's cheap.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.060]   And I offer you unconditional money back refund.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.620]   If you've already taken that course,
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.520]   take my course, How to Survive and Thrive
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.180]   During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.660]   Because everything in that course
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   is applicable to surviving and thriving during a recession.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.860]   Surviving and thriving during a personal job layoff.
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.940]   Now, I talk about some hardcore scenarios.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.900]   If you wanna be prepared for the next Great Depression,
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.780]   how to survive and thrive
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.060]   during the coming economic crisis.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.520]   That'll talk you through it.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.940]   If you wanna be prepared for the hyperinflation
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:25.620]   of the US dollar, I'll walk you through it.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.680]   That's in that course.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.940]   I'm not shying away from the tough stuff.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.820]   But the techniques and tactics
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.980]   to prepare for losing your job in a recession
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.840]   are ironically very similar to the techniques and tactics
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.380]   for preparing for hyperinflation of the US dollar.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.340]   So if you haven't taken that course,
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.640]   I ask you to do it,
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.140]   How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.340]   You can find both of those courses

[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.020]   If you have heard them and didn't do what I said,
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.180]   consider listening to them and taking action.
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.340]   Because just listening to these next three shows
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.580]   two years ago or three years ago, that won't prepare you.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.100]   But taking some of the actions will.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.100]   Thank you for listening to my show,
