[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   Are there things in our environment, including our food, that are diminishing our reproductive
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.160]   and overall health?
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.840]   So my answer to that is yes.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.320]   I think there's no question about that.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   The question comes down to when and in whom and what dose and so on and so forth.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.180]   But whether there are, let's just say broadly, things, yes, of course.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.540]   My thesis is that chemicals in the environment, that's a very broad class, so we'll have to
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.840]   say some chemicals in the environment, at the right time, to the right organism, affect
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.280]   fertility.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.180]   And let me just say fertility is one area that I've focused on, but actually this class
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.360]   of chemicals that I'm primarily interested in are those that affect the body's hormones.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.560]   So those are known as hormone-disrupting chemicals or endocrine-disrupting chemicals, hormone-altering
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   chemicals, whatever.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   You know, there's a lot of names.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   But that helps you focus on where to look for the effects.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.160]   Because if it's hormone-altering, you can now have something to really ask.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.360]   Okay, here's a chemical.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.840]   Does it affect a hormone?
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.840]   Which hormone?
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   When?
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   How?
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040]   And then you start, that's almost laying out an experiment right there, right?
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.920]   So focusing in on hormone-disrupting chemicals I think is useful.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:43.060]   I studied environmental chemicals, not so much pharmaceuticals, for quite a while when
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.600]   I was at the California Department of Health Services.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.080]   And then I had an aha moment.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:02.680]   I was flying to Japan with my friend John Brock, who's a chemist at CDC, wonderful chemist.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.000]   And we had long flights, we were talking about this and that.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.040]   And he says, Shauna, you should look at phthalates.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.760]   And I'm going, why should I look at phthalates?
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.960]   I never heard of phthalates, right?
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   And he said, well, we can now measure them at the CDC and we see they're in everybody.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.160]   They're in women of reproductive age.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.480]   Fact one.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:32.560]   Fact two, colleagues at the NTP have shown something they are calling the phthalate syndrome.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960]   And so he explained.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.600]   What is NTP?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   National Toxicology Program.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Sorry.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Thank you.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   For using alphabet.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.000]   No, it's quite all right.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.040]   National Toxicology Program, a governmental research center.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.600]   And their job is to look at chemicals and see what is the toxicity.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.940]   So it could be reproductive, it could be carcinogenicity, it could be neurotoxicity.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.840]   That's what they do.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.880]   And so they had signaled out these phthalates as being reproductively toxic and specifically
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.520]   to males and specifically when exposure is in utero.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.760]   Pregnant mom is exposed to phthalates and somehow the fetus is disrupted.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   Yes.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.840]   If you don't mind, I'd like to know, is mom ingesting phthalates in the form of food?
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.420]   Is she inhaling phthalates?
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.120]   Are they landing on her skin?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.280]   What are the modes of entry into the body of the mom that, let's just assume it goes
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.160]   through the placental barrier into the fetus and is impacting fetal development?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   Right.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.120]   So in those experiments, it was through food, but we are exposed in all those ways you mentioned.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.920]   Every way that something can get into our body, phthalates get in there.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   But let's come back to that.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.840]   Let me go to the experiment at NTP.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.620]   So what they did at NTP, National Toxicology Program, they fed mother rats various doses
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.460]   of these various phthalates.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.540]   And what they found was no changes in the females that they found at that time.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.540]   The female offspring?
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.900]   Female offspring, sorry.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.540]   But in the male offspring, they found that the genitals were, I summarize it by saying,
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.040]   incompletely masculinized.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.740]   So I'll explain what that is.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.380]   So for that, I have to back up and say something you probably know very well.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.820]   But I'll just explain it.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.300]   The genital tract initially is a ridge.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.020]   It's a single ridge.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.840]   It's the same in males and females.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.340]   It's not sexually dimorphic at the beginning.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.780]   And then under the influence of testosterone, in a very specific window called the male
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.540]   programming window, in rats, it stays, I think, nine to 12 of gestation, so a very short window.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.100]   To orient people, I think rat mouse gestation is about 21 days or so?
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.100]   Okay.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.340]   And that's the early first trimester.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.180]   But that comes later.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:14.860]   So at that time, if they feed their mother that chemical in her food, then her male offspring
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.940]   are born with changes in his genitals, or more likely to.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:27.820]   And so what they tend to have is a smaller penis, less descent of the testes, more likely
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.460]   to have undersented testicles.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.380]   There are internal changes that we didn't get into in our human study because we can't
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.380]   look there.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.900]   But the epididymis, there are changes and so on.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.540]   The whole genital tract is altered.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.940]   And the most important measure for me, as it turned out, and for humans, and perhaps
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:56.140]   for animals, is something that the scientists, animal scientists had studied for a long time,
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.980]   for actually 90 plus years, but had never been studied in humans.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.060]   And that is the distance from the anus to the genitals.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.220]   This collection of changes in the male genitals was given the name the phthalate syndrome.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:23.300]   And you, I challenge you to think of any syndrome, aside from alcohol, you know, there, fetal
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.980]   alcohol syndrome, of course, there's a syndrome.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.220]   But note what syndrome is attached to a chemical class.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.580]   One that comes to mind would be, for instance, the thalidomide babies, right?
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.600]   A miscarriage, anti-miscarriage drug that changed limb development.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.180]   That's a very extreme example.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:51.020]   There are a lot of things in development where hormones set up a potential to respond to
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.700]   other hormones later.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.940]   It's not that testosterone grows the penis during development.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.660]   It does that.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.140]   But more so it establishes a potential for the penis to grow when exposed to things later
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.140]   during puberty.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.540]   Do I have that right?
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.540]   Right.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.060]   As far as the name goes, which is the phthalate syndrome, there is thalidomide.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.380]   It's not usually called the thalidomide syndrome, but it could be, so you're right about that.
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.100]   But it's extremely rare.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:23.740]   And there is no environmentally, you know, chemical in the environment as opposed to
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.980]   a pharmaceutical that is given a syndrome.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.540]   So this is very, very unique.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.780]   And so I thought, wow, John's telling me this on the plane, right?
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:40.220]   Something in the environment that is basically having an endocrine and body disruptive effect,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.860]   at least on par with fetal alcohol syndrome and thalidomide syndrome.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.860]   Right.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.180]   So when, well, at this point it was only animals, right?
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.540]   Because John was telling me about the NTP study, which was in rats.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.760]   And so I thought, wow, you know, I like puzzles.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.500]   So my first question was, is this happening in humans?
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.380]   You might ask that, you know, as a natural thing to ask.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.380]   Great question.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.840]   And then I thought, how would we find out?
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.640]   And answering that question took me 10 years, okay?
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:27.840]   And so if you think about, okay, phthalate in the mother, changes in the genitals of
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.340]   the offspring, connect them.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.100]   How do we do that, right?
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.660]   So we have to start with phthalates in the mother.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.220]   So how do we know that?
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:46.760]   Well, fortunately or not, I had stored a lot of urine from pregnant women from a study
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.160]   that I was doing on sperm count.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.320]   I just got the women's urine coincidentally, if you will.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.040]   I thought, well, save it.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.280]   You know, it's not expensive and not hard.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.600]   Minus 80 degree freezers, doesn't take a lot of room, put it in there.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.920]   So I had this urine save from pregnant women, and then I knew from John that we could look
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.520]   in the urine for phthalate metabolites.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.160]   So these are products that the body forms when they're exposed to phthalates, and you
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.780]   can measure them in urine.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.180]   So I thought, okay, I could get that urine, I could look at the phthalate metabolites,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.100]   and then I'd know what the mother was exposed to.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.740]   And based on the animal data, we have good evidence that it actually makes its way to
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.060]   the fetus.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.560]   So then I thought, okay, then maybe there's a change in the babies.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.820]   So then I had to get the babies.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:52.720]   So fortunately, I had done this study on pregnant couples, pregnant women and their partners,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.160]   and I was able to call them and say, would you come in and let us measure your baby's
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   phthalates?
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   Right?
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.000]   How willing were parents to let you do that?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   It seems-
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   They were okay.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Most of them were okay with that.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Were they?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Well, they trusted us.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.560]   They had been in a study with us, and we were reputable.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.280]   Those babies were still-
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.340]   Young, but not newborn.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.520]   So this was a while later.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.240]   The babies that we actually got were, on average, I think about a month, 12 months old.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.520]   So not ideal maybe because the rats had been measured at birth.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.880]   The rat genitals had been, but that's what we could do at that time.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.000]   The reason I ask is there's always the potential for ongoing phthalate exposure to the newborn.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Sure.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Absolutely.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.480]   But I suppose in either case, you're able to draw some potential link between, or potentially
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.160]   draw a link, I have to be careful with my language there, between phthalate exposure
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.720]   in utero and ex-utero and these external biomarkers.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.280]   Given that the critical window is quite short and quite early, by the way, let me just say,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.320]   when the rats, they did a lot of work on this critical window, and when the rat moms were
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.000]   exposed before day nine, it did nothing.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.880]   And when they were exposed after day 12, it did nothing.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.440]   So it was only the exposure during that critical window is very delicate, and it's by the way
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.040]   true of the brain as well.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.120]   So teasing out what is the critical window is one of the challenges that we have when
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.760]   we work with these chemicals.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:33.600]   So I wasn't so much worried about exposure in the delivery room and in their feed in
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.280]   the first year of life, because I knew that it was unlikely to change these measures.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.360]   To my knowledge, this is the first time it was used as a toxicological measure in humans.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.500]   So we did that study.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:55.480]   We related those measurements to what CDC had measured in the urine of our women, collected
