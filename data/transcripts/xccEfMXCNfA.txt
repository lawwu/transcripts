[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.260]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.000]   with John Piper.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.460]   Pastor John, you were in Vancouver recently
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.080]   teaching on First Peter in a look at the book
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   regional conference at Westside Church.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.900]   And it seems like things really went well
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.160]   while you were at the conference.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.060]   And there was a lot going on in the news, certainly.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.880]   As you look back on that trip and over what you taught,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.600]   do you have any reflection to share with us here
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.260]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast?
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.580]   - The earthquake in Nepal happened while I was there,
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.240]   which for me personally, and I think for others as well,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.100]   put the second half of our study,
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.760]   it happened on, we knew about it
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.580]   as we began Saturday morning.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.800]   It put the second half of our study under a cloud
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800]   of very serious reality.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.600]   In other words, no game playing here with First Peter,
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.160]   because First Peter, I had said to them Friday night,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.560]   is a book that more than any other book
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.160]   in the New Testament is pervasive with suffering.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.640]   It focuses on, teaches about,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.480]   prepares people for suffering.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.800]   And so we were talking about some of the most serious
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.680]   kinds of losses in the world
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.040]   with this enormous tragedy unfolding,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.320]   which as we speak right now,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.960]   has about 5,000 people killed, 9,000 injured,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.280]   8 million affected, 1 million children in urgent need.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.720]   And of course the ripple effects
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.480]   from all of those are enormous.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.800]   And I think what I want to say, Tony,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   in response to that event and that moment in my life
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   and that seminar, is that there is a kind of sequence
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.400]   to the responses that Christians should have,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.600]   reflective Christians especially.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.700]   If we get the sequence wrong,
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.900]   or the spirit of the sequence wrong,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.280]   we may do more damage than good if we open our mouths,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.220]   or if we don't open our mouths.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.160]   So here's what I mean by the sequence.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   Number one, I think the first response we should have
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.560]   when we hear a news like this earthquake
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   is a heart that feels empathy or compassion.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   In other words, we should use immediately by reflex
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.640]   our imaginations to imagine that we are trapped
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.320]   under the rubble and wishing somebody would find us,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.520]   or our child is trapped under the rubble
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   and we're standing outside frantic to find the child.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.640]   In other words, use our imaginations
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   to feel what is being felt,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.400]   and then to feel compassion and do neighbor love.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Love your neighbor as you love yourself,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.820]   even before your hands can move a muscle.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.040]   I think that's the first thing that should happen
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.700]   and we should repent if it's not happening.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.680]   Second, rising up in my heart
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   should then be after that kind of compassion and empathy,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   prayers of desire for the good
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.200]   of those who've experienced the greatest losses.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.840]   We're Christians.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   We know that the greatest good anyone could receive
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.860]   is Jesus Christ.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.600]   We know that the greatest need
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.800]   every human being has is Jesus.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.440]   We know that Jesus is overflowing in love
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.720]   and compassion toward all who call upon him,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   and he's ready to forgive their sins and meet their needs,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   especially the most painful needs and eternal needs.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.160]   And we know, this is what I found out
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.320]   by just glancing at Twitter feeds,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.880]   we know that we will be found fault with
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.040]   if we pray this way for people.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.900]   That is, if we mention Jesus,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   or if we hope that somehow people would find Jesus
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.400]   through this tragedy,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   we will be lambasted as exploitive of this moment
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.200]   and that we're simply doing partisan politics
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.020]   and utterly insensitive to the people and so on.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.040]   But in spite of that kind of criticism,
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.080]   I am totally convinced we should pray
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.600]   and pray something like this.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.080]   I try to formulate in my mind,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.320]   how should I pray?
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.160]   I try to do this.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.360]   Every time a calamity comes along,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.080]   so my prayer would go something like this.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.360]   Oh God, have mercy on those
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.080]   who have experienced the greatest losses here.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.320]   Have mercy on those who've lost
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.360]   their most cherished family members,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.000]   children who've lost their parents,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.360]   wives who've lost their husbands,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.040]   thousands who've lost every earthly possession.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.520]   Raise up, oh God, every resource
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.560]   for the supply of the most urgent physical needs
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.200]   that the Nepalese people have.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.040]   And Father, in your great mercy,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.480]   grant that your people, Christians,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.600]   would be among those who make the greatest sacrifices
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.320]   to meet the needs.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   And would you grant that thousands and thousands of people
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.680]   would be led through these mercies
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.280]   to see the merciful hand of God, yourself,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.480]   the Father of our Lord Jesus,
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.960]   and that they would meet Jesus
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.760]   as their most precious friend
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.160]   and the savior of their souls,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.360]   the one of infinite power, great compassion,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.320]   who could give them a future
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.160]   and a hope for this world and the next.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.520]   So I think, Tony, we should pray like that
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.280]   regardless of what anybody says.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.080]   And then thirdly, in this sequence that I have in my mind,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   we should, after we've felt and prayed, we should give.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.000]   We should go online, find reliable venues
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.400]   and sources and missions,
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.800]   and in the name of Jesus, get out our Visa card
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   and be a part of the rescue operation
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.000]   and let our hands join our hearts
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.600]   in the compassion that we began with.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.360]   And then the fourth thing in this sequence
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.800]   is that we should think deeply and biblically
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.200]   about what in the world is happening in the world.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.680]   We may not speak at this point.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   We may or we may not.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.920]   If the setting seems right, we might,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.080]   but if not, we won't.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.840]   I just mean our minds should kick into gear
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.880]   to engage the Bible and refresh our understanding
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.080]   of what kind of world we live in.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.160]   And I think the very first aspect of that
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   would be to respond to Jesus' words addressed to us
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.440]   when we take Him, the problem of Nepal
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.840]   or the Tower of Siloam on which 18 people fell,
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.800]   to which He responded, "Are those 18 people,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.700]   "do you think that they are worse offenders
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.140]   "than all the others who live in Jerusalem?
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.080]   "No, I tell you, but unless you repent,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.720]   "you will all likewise perish," Luke 13.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.480]   In other words, I should hear the Lord God Almighty
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   address me, me, "Piper, do you think
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.540]   "that you don't deserve to be under that rubble?"
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.800]   So get that right in your head.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.920]   You deserve to be there, and unless you repent,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.360]   you will be there sooner or later.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   So it should have a profoundly sobering effect
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.660]   on me as a Christian.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.960]   You know, the article that we put up at Desiring God
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   about praying for Nepal said that the man
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   who was in Nepal who wrote it knew of 30 Christians
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   who had been killed.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.360]   So it's Christians and non-Christians
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.400]   who are swept away in these kinds of calamities.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.840]   It's a word for us before it's a word for anybody else.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.000]   And the last thing in this sequence,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.600]   after we have felt and after we've prayed
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   and after we've given and after we've thought and repented,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.240]   then we might, and here timing really matters
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.860]   and tone really matters and content really matters,
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.560]   we might speak a biblical perspective
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   on why are these calamities in the world?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.640]   And that's what I tried to do then, Lord's Day morning.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.000]   So after the seminar was over on Friday and Saturday,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.840]   I stayed to preach at West Sidon,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.040]   and my title was "The Pain of the World
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.000]   and the Purposes of God," and I did not focus
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.360]   mainly on Nepal.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.200]   Nepal was kind of like a gargantuan backdrop
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.960]   giving seriousness.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.500]   I tried to talk about the suffering
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.240]   that all of us will necessarily taste
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.240]   as we walk through a world of futility and corruption
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.280]   and the situation in the world at the moment
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.320]   simply provided the kind of seriousness and weight
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.040]   that made everything feel more,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.000]   it was an unusual moment.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.920]   That's probably why I felt like addressing this here.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.880]   It felt, there was an unusual hush upon the people.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.640]   So my prayer right now for those listening to this,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.060]   and who knows, between the time we're recording
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.420]   and the time they listen,
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.480]   another huge calamity may have happened.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.920]   My prayer for this is that people
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.440]   would have great compassion
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   and would have great prayerfulness and great generosity
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.880]   and great biblical thoughtfulness and great wisdom
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.720]   about what to say and when to say it.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   - Yes, amen.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.640]   And that sermon, "The Pain of the World
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.920]   and the Purposes of God," was preached in Vancouver
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.520]   on April 26th, and you can find that sermon,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.120]   both video and audio, online at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.680]   For everything you need to know about this podcast,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.240]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.760]   Well, does Hebrews chapter six, verses one and two
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.400]   imply that the gospel is only for beginner Christians?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.960]   I'll ask John Piper that tomorrow.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.960]   Thanks for listening.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:54.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
