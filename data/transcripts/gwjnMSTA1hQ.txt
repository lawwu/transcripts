[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.000]   All right, we have a question here from cplayer.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.600]   cplayer says, "I often spend a lot of time on daily, weekly, and monthly plans,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000]   but I never follow through.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.400]   I have this issue where I know what I should be doing, but I don't do it.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   I'm even mindful that I'm making a bad choice. Help!"
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.300]   Then he or she elaborates,
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.200]   "I really admire you, David Allen, Jocko, and Ryan Holiday."
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.600]   By the way, that'd be a cool dinner party.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800]   It'd be a weird, interesting dinner party.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.500]   I think we would, after one or two bottles of wine,
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200]   Jocko would beat up David Allen
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700]   while Ryan gave us a lecture on Epica Tetris,
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.100]   and I fell asleep because, you know, I don't get enough sleep because of my kids.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.500]   All right, going on with the elaboration,
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500]   "You each have this great discipline and follow-through.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.700]   I don't. I put all my effort in the plans.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100]   I'm great at planning, but I'm poor at doing the work."
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.800]   All right, so see, player, let's spend less time planning.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.600]   Forget that for now.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.000]   What I want you to commit to is a single thing, metrics.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400]   You're going to have a notebook
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.900]   that every single day at the end of the day,
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.400]   you write down whatever the key metrics we're going to design for here
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.900]   in a second to track every day, you're going to write them down.
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500]   You can use, like, my time block planner has a metric space.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.300]   If you're just tracking metrics, you can get,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.500]   I like the Moleskine monthly planners,
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.000]   where it has a little bit of space for every day,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.300]   and you have a whole week on one two-page spread.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.800]   So it's a perfect amount of space if you're just tracking metrics.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.500]   And this is the thing you want to commit to,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.800]   is there's a small number of metrics I track every day,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.600]   and I'm going to track them.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.200]   If they're good, if they're bad, I don't care, I write it down.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.000]   So now you only have to do one thing.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.200]   Am I the person that does this one thing or not?
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   When you put all of your energy on just one thing,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.500]   that is a much easier commitment to maintain than the amorphous,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.200]   ambiguous demands of, I want a fully captured,
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.100]   organized, multi-scale planned productivity life.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800]   That's a big complicated ask.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.700]   Writing down three metrics for five seconds every night,
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.400]   and it's right there on your dresser, so you see it,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.500]   that's something you can commit to,
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.800]   and you have to commit to something.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.400]   At some point, you have to commit to something.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.700]   This is what I want you to commit to.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.300]   Now, what metric should you put in there?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.900]   I want you to start with a really basic productivity-related metric.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.400]   And it really could be as simple as this.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.200]   SD is what I do in mine.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.700]   SD is an acronym for shutdown.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.100]   And there's going to be two hash marks you can put by this.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.300]   So there's three options.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.200]   It could be SD with no hash mark by it,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.100]   SD with one hash mark,
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.000]   SD with two hash marks.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now, what are these going to correspond to?
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.900]   You get to write down that first hash mark next to SD
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900]   if at the beginning of your day,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.500]   you do the following things.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.000]   You take a notebook for jotting down loose ideas or tasks
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   that things to come up to mind.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.200]   You take that notebook,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.000]   and you go through everything on it,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.500]   and you put it on whatever your formal lists are
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.000]   that you keep track of on your computer.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Two, you look at your computer calendar,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   what's on my schedule for today.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.800]   And three, you jot down some type of plan for the day,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.200]   even if it's just, I have meetings today, do them.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.600]   Or I'm going to go to the gym first thing and run some errands.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   That's it.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.500]   You do those things, you get the first hash mark.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800]   At the end of the day, if you do a full shutdown,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.200]   so you get everything out of your head,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.500]   you process the things that you've captured,
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.400]   you look at your calendar, you look at your week,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.500]   you kind of have a sense of what you want to do the next day,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.900]   you get the second hash mark.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.700]   And that's it.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.100]   That's your productivity metric.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.900]   That is going to go a really long way.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Because you don't want to put down no hashes.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.000]   You feel good after a couple days putting down the both hashes
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.100]   and it doesn't take long.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.600]   But now you're locked in, you're beginning your day,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.100]   things aren't loose,
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.500]   the stuff that was captured loosely gets looked at,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.100]   you look at your calendar, you have a plan,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.500]   you shut down at the end of your day.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.000]   Now you are not running in an ungrounded mode.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.200]   You know what's going on,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.700]   you're not keeping track of things in your head,
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.000]   you're doing your best to keep plans.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.300]   I don't care if you fail with your plans,
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.600]   we're not talking about that yet.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   You're just making a little plan.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.800]   At the end of the day, you're shutting down that plan.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.700]   And then you should have a couple other metrics,
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.800]   maybe one about eating or fitness or exercise
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.500]   or one about, you know, if you're religious,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.600]   did you do your prayers?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.800]   Or if you're into meditation,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.900]   did you do your meditation session?
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.000]   You know, have three,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200]   maybe three different metrics of things that are important
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.700]   in your life.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.900]   And just do that, do that for the next few months.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.200]   Just track that every day.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.800]   Some days you won't do them, some days you will,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.300]   but every single day you write down,
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.800]   did I do this, did I not?
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   And make one of those metrics be that
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.100]   SD hash mark one hash mark two.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.300]   Just do that for a couple months.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.800]   That will get you into the habit of,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   I feel much better.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   When I start my day officially,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   I make a plan and I shut it down when I'm done.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.900]   And once you're there,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.500]   and that becomes second nature,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.900]   then dive into the deep end
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.400]   and say, let's get rock and rolling with full,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.500]   multi-scale planning where my semester plan influences
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.300]   my weekly plan, which influences my daily time block plan
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.700]   and my capture systems are sophisticated
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.500]   and I'm trying to figure out these complex protocols
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.900]   for how I organize my communication with my colleagues
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.500]   and all of that type of stuff you can get to,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.400]   but you're not there yet.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.900]   So this is what I want to recommend you do.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.300]   Metrics are the number one thing you start with.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.400]   You got to commit to something at some point.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.700]   This is the easiest thing you can,
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.500]   but it's going to be the seed on which I think a much more
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.900]   lower anxiety,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.700]   intentional life can grow.
