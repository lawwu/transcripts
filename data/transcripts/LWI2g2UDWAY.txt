[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:13.280]   Welcome back to Ask The Compound,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.280]   where I think we have one of the most intelligent audiences
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.920]   in all of financial entertainment.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560]   The people who ask the more in-depth questions
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.640]   have always done their homework.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.520]   The people who ask more general questions
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.060]   seem to always be on the right path,
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.120]   so I like that we get a kind of mix of the two.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.000]   We're gonna talk about a mix of those two today.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.960]   Remember, if you have a question for us, email us,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.280]   Today, we are sponsored by our friends at Bird Dogs.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.520]   One of the things I like to do in the summer,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.440]   I like to be a little active,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200]   so I take the kids on a bike ride once or twice a weekend,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.220]   and I like to be both stylish and comfortable
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.520]   because I'm riding the bike,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.480]   and I still have one of my little ones on the back with me,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.740]   on those little trailer bikes, you know?
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.540]   You hook it up to the back, so I got like three wheels,
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.060]   so I'm doing a lot of the work.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.040]   She pedals sometimes, but I'm,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.400]   so I have to be, I have to have some movement.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.160]   The Bird Dogs give me some movement.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.080]   They're stretchy, they're nice,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.160]   but then when I get there, I look good as well,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.280]   so I love the fact that you can do a little of both,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.120]   look good.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580]   I had a friend last week, said, "What are those shorts?"
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.920]   I said, "Oh, come on, these are Bird Dogs."
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.560]   Get yourself a pair, so I think I talked him into them.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   Remember, if you go to birddog.com/atc,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.860]   you get one of these free tumblers,
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.700]   which is kind of nice.
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.520]   You got one, too?
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.240]   - I remember mine today.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.400]   - Do we still have to use the code to get it or not?
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   - No code, just the URL now, /atc.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.960]   That does it.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.800]   - Screamin' deal.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.040]   All right, let's do a question.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   - Yep.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.920]   Okay, up first today,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.480]   we have, "I'm in my mid-30s and my business
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.600]   "has done very well over the past three years.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.720]   "I'm trying to decide what to do with the savings
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.940]   "I've stacked away in a high-yield savings account.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.920]   "I was planning to pay off my $150,000 student loans
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.600]   "and invest the rest,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.740]   "or I could pay off my $500,000 3% mortgage,
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.320]   "but I can't do both.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.200]   "I'm weighing my options here while considering
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.240]   "that a recession could significantly reduce my income.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.320]   "Which option is going to give me
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.420]   "the biggest nest egg in retirement?
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.420]   "Pay off my mortgage and use my mortgage payment
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480]   "for investments, pay off my student loans,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.820]   "and dollar-cost average into investments.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.280]   "Keep my mortgage, make monthly loan payments,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.760]   "and DCA, dollar-cost average, into investments."
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.160]   - Now, I feel like we're kicking this off
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.080]   with a not-to-brag today,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.340]   but do the six figures and student loans
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.960]   also counteract that not-to-brag?
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.000]   And make it a little bit, right?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.840]   - Yeah.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.400]   However, it means that maybe they're pretty highly educated,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.880]   so maybe that's a form of not-to-brag.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.140]   - It sounds to me like the student loans
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.400]   were a pretty good investment.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.320]   So let's go through each.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.160]   We've got three options here.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.980]   Let's go through 'em one by one.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.560]   Pay off the mortgage and use mortgage payments
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.440]   for investments.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.220]   I don't like this one one bit.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.760]   I'm anti-pay off 3% mortgage.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.600]   I have been for a while.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.460]   I just see no reason to get rid of that
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.460]   when inflation is so high, interest rates are so high.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.080]   I mean, yes, it would free up monthly payments,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.600]   but why would you decrease your liquidity,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.280]   especially if you're worried about what a recession
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.960]   might do to your business for variable income?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.720]   Plus, that 3% mortgage is currently below
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.080]   probably what you're earning
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.440]   in your online savings account.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.920]   Put that in T-bills, you're talking about 5%.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.760]   I mean, you're essentially paying for your mortgage
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.520]   if you're doing that, and you have some left over.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.560]   So I think either one of those options.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.120]   I just, I don't like paying off the 3% mortgage.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.080]   It makes no sense.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.120]   I mean, I just, over my dead body,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.960]   I'm letting go of this 3%.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   I wish I could like extend it to like 90 years
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.480]   and just never pay it off.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.640]   So, I mean, you could dollar cost average into the market,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.060]   but why would you do that with your monthly payments
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.320]   and not just do it with the cash?
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.180]   So the next one is pay off the student loans,
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.440]   but then you have some more money.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.840]   I guess if this person can pay off their 500K mortgage,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.700]   they have a decent amount of money.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.720]   Saved up.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.920]   So you pay off the student loans and then you DCA.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.960]   This one depends on your rate for student loans.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.560]   Are they more than say, I don't know, 5%?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.160]   At that level, maybe it makes some sense to pay them all off.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.000]   If they're below 5%, I think I might hold off a little bit,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.240]   unless that debt makes you just violently ill.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.080]   I just don't see the rush when interest rates are so high
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.600]   and inflation is so high.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.280]   The third one is keep the mortgage, make the payments,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.840]   DCA into investment, right?
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.400]   Keep all the debt.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.260]   If you're okay keeping the debt,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.160]   this probably makes the most sense with a caveat.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.880]   Like you mentioned, the potential recession
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.800]   could reduce your income.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.120]   So I think if you're in a cyclical business
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.520]   with a variable income like this,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.880]   maybe increase your margin of safety
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.920]   and have a little bit more of an emergency fund.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.400]   So I'd keep a cash cushion, potentially.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.360]   But there's another option too,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.620]   where you don't have to make one big decision with the money.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.160]   There's no one forcing you with a gun to your head,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.200]   saying you have to do this.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.840]   Pick one, two, or three, door one, two, or three, right?
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.400]   You could pay off a small chunk of your student loans.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.480]   You'd set aside some money for an emergency fund.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.720]   You could even do a small lump sum into the stock market
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.080]   and then dollar cost average the rest.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140]   So you don't have to make one choice.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.640]   You could kind of diversify your options,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.880]   which helps minimize the regret, I think.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.000]   But I don't know.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   It sounds like you're in a pretty good place to me.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.860]   And if the yields on those loans
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.220]   or the interest rates on those loans are still pretty low,
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.600]   as long as you're okay holding the debt,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.640]   I see no problem holding that for a while.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.740]   And then you can always pay it off in the future as well.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.880]   You don't have to make a rush decision now.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.860]   - Right, yeah.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.520]   And they mentioned that, you know,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.600]   given the current environment for student loans,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.000]   but yeah, we don't really know what the future holds,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.560]   so it's hard to bank on.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.840]   - Yeah, they kind of said people, you know,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.940]   the government's been pretty, you know,
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.560]   liberal with student loans lately and payments.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.240]   And yeah, I don't think there's a rush to do that,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.600]   but especially a 3% mortgage,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.840]   when T-bill yields are higher than that,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.960]   that just, I don't see how that ever makes sense
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.760]   in today's environment.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   - Yeah, and so as far as debt goes in general,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.520]   what is your number of like where you draw that line?
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.500]   - Well, T-bill yields are 5% right now, right?
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.860]   That's a pretty good place to start, I would think.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.520]   Right, because that's your hurdle rate.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.360]   Let's do another one.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.200]   - That question's from Zachariah, by the way.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.040]   So up next, we have a question from Casey,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.300]   who I recognize from social media or the chat or somewhere.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.340]   So Casey writes, what's the incentive here
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.440]   to buy AAA corporate debt versus just buying U.S. treasuries
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.000]   that are yielding slightly higher and are risk-free?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.480]   Is this normal?
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.040]   - Casey, a very astute member of our audience here.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.000]   No, this is definitely not normal.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840]   John, do a chart on.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.040]   I have good data for the Federal Reserve
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.220]   on AAA-rated corporate debt and three-month T-bills
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.780]   going back to 1934.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.900]   So the average spread of AAA corporate bond yields
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.240]   over T-bills is 2.4%.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.360]   We've had T-bill yields higher than corporate bonds before,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480]   but it only happened in the early '80s and the 1970s,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.600]   which makes sense, like now,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.700]   inflation was much higher, interest rates were rising.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.040]   However, this is very rare to see this.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.840]   So there's almost 1,100 months in this data.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.740]   These are month-end data from the Fed.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.320]   By my calculation, 33 of those months
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.360]   saw T-bill yields greater than corporate bond yields.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.120]   So we're talking like 3% of the time.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.320]   This is very rare to see an inverted yield curve
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.000]   between short-term treasuries,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.640]   ultra-short-term treasuries, and corporate bonds.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.360]   So why should there be a spread?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.160]   'Cause corporate bonds are riskier, right?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.200]   In corporate bonds, the default rate is relatively low,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.480]   but businesses can and do get in trouble,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.720]   and you could have some defaults.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.040]   You also have the potential for getting downgraded
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.680]   from that triple-A rating, going into double-A or single-A,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.800]   and then maybe, or high-yield, even.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.120]   And at that point, the bond price is gonna get disrupted,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.320]   and corporate bonds have a much higher drawdown risk
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.840]   than treasuries, especially short-term treasuries.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.760]   So John, do another.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.460]   We'll throw a second chart on of the day.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.360]   This is just the drawdown profile for LQD,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.760]   which is a corporate bond ETF,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.160]   versus BIL, which is a one-to-three T-bill ETF.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.880]   And you can see in 2008 crisis, corporate bonds fell 17%.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.000]   They fell 20% in the corona panic,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.280]   and then they fell 25% last year when the Fed cut rates.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.880]   So those other two ones, it was relatively quick.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.240]   You had this huge V down and V up,
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.200]   and that happened mostly because people
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.600]   were panic selling back then.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.800]   They only wanted to own treasury.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.280]   So corporate bonds got dinged.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.840]   But this is the kind of thing in corporate bonds,
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.980]   you can get dinged like that during a financial crisis
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.040]   or a panic situation.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.380]   So if the question is, do corporate bonds make sense
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.700]   right now relative to T-bills?
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.540]   No, they don't.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.840]   The yields are higher in T-bills,
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.640]   and you have much less volatility as per interest rates.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.680]   But we don't know how this, that's short-term.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.380]   Short-term T-bills make a lot more sense.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.160]   But long-term, corporate bonds still should,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.120]   if there's any relationship between risk and reward,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.020]   and I think they are always attached at the hip,
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.000]   although sometimes they break up.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.160]   They go on a break, Ross and Rachel style.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.760]   They still have those Friends reruns on all the time on TBS.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.160]   So I just saw that we're on a break one the other day.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.880]   Sometimes risk and reward go on a break, right?
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.320]   And don't get me in the comments here
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.200]   about how Friends is overrated.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.120]   We had like 100 million people
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.400]   watching that show back in the day.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.920]   I mean, hey, if Michael can say that Steve Carrell's
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.200]   not funny, then anyone can say anything.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.640]   Nothing is properly rated in the internet era anymore.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.720]   John, do another chart on here.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.220]   This is my table of long-term performance
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.060]   of different bond yields.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.540]   So we're talking long-term corporates,
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.560]   long-term government bonds, five-year treasuries,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.400]   and three-month T-bills.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.220]   And the reason I wanted to show this
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.480]   is because you can see the highest returning asset
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.880]   is corporate bonds over this period from 1934 to 2023.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.440]   Next comes long-term government bonds,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.400]   then five-year treasuries, then three-month T-bills.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.240]   And this makes sense.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.840]   And you can see the volatility kind of goes
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.760]   in the same order as well.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   I was a little surprised to see long-term government bonds
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.680]   more volatile than corporate bonds,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.840]   but they're still in the same ballpark.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.480]   So this makes sense because risk and return,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.980]   especially in bonds, are attached to the HIP
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.200]   where if you're gonna earn a higher yield,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.120]   you should expect a higher risk
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.680]   and especially higher volatility.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.040]   So I don't expect this current situation to last.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.320]   I talk about how rare it is.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.000]   This situation has basically been caused by the pandemic
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.760]   and government spending and the Fed.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.000]   And so in the short term, things are weird and out of whack,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.580]   and it seems like T-bills are the right choice to make.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.000]   Over the long-term, you'd still expect corporate bonds
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.320]   to have higher long-term expected return
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.620]   once rates somehow normalize, if there is such a thing.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.400]   Now, what are you supposed to do with that information
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   as an investor?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.600]   You could just change your allocation
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.020]   based on the risk reward profile all the time,
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.360]   or you could stand pat and say,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.960]   you know what, I'm not gonna try to guess.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.240]   I'm just gonna pick an allocation
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.780]   and fix something that works for me,
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.620]   and I'm gonna stick with it.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.080]   And I think you just have to do what works for you.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.460]   That's kind of where I fall down on this.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.760]   I don't think there's a right or wrong answer here.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.160]   - I have maybe a dumb question,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.580]   but a junk bond, is that always a corporate bond,
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.180]   or can it be like a sovereign bond
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.340]   of a really risky country?
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.020]   Is it like a yield or what?
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.180]   - There are emerging market bonds,
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.620]   which could be sovereign bonds,
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.080]   but high yield is typically corporate bonds,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.980]   just lower rated corporate bonds.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.980]   So same thing, just a higher default rate
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.980]   in much riskier companies.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.260]   - So perfect for my portfolio, is what you're saying?
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.380]   - You could buy some oat milk high yield bonds probably.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.260]   - Okay, I might look for that.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.140]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Eric.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.140]   One of the biggest tells for the housing bubble
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.540]   in the 2000s was the income to housing price relationship.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.800]   I'm pretty sure Michael Lewis even wrote about this
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.120]   in the big short.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.540]   I know the housing market is different this time around,
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.420]   but there is no way incomes have kept up
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.980]   with housing price gains, which are even bigger this time.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.020]   Help me understand how this is not another housing bubble.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.540]   This always sends a shiver down my spine
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.660]   just because that was such a rough period.
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.260]   I graduated college right in the middle of that.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.100]   It was not good.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.620]   - I think one of the first people I ever saw
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.980]   write about that relationship of incomes to housing
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.500]   was our very own Barry Ritholtz.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.460]   Let's bring him in to help out on this one.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.460]   Barry, you were writing about this.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.160]   Was it for the street.com or the big picture?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.260]   One of those two, I can't remember.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260]   - That was probably the big picture.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.020]   I was writing "Bailout Nation"
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.420]   on the blog chapter by chapter.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.020]   I'd throw up a couple of paragraphs.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.640]   People would say, have you seen this data?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.740]   What about this chart?
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.580]   What about this guy?
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.820]   And really, I had like a thousand co-authors.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.260]   So it was really helpful.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.260]   Remember back in the 2000s, the big driver of the bubble.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.380]   First, it was really more of a mortgage bubble
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.860]   than a housing bubble.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.300]   But the big driver was securitization.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.100]   We're gonna take all these mortgages
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.220]   and slice and dice them and spread out the risk.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.960]   But what fed that demand, what really drove that
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.700]   was all of these non-bank lenders
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.540]   that were popping up and writing mortgages for everybody.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.500]   Remember all the nomenclature back then,
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.100]   the ninja loans, no income, no job, no assets.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.060]   No docs, stated income.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.980]   The traditional FDIC banks weren't allowed to do that.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.920]   They had to do conforming loans.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.020]   But all the crazy loans, the 228,
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.180]   zero interest for the first two years,
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.620]   all that stuff came from the sort of,
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.380]   calling it the shadow banking sector is wrong.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.220]   These were just non-bank lenders.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.840]   And when you drop lending standards to zero,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.940]   well, guess what happens?
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.820]   You're gonna give a ton of people access to capital
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.660]   that wouldn't have.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.060]   It also, adding to the flame to the fire,
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.060]   was you had a period of flat wages
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.580]   while everything gradually increased in price.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.120]   It wasn't very inflationary, but over time it adds up.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.100]   And so people hate lowering their living standards.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.460]   And so people were taking HELOCs
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.220]   and people were refinancing or just flipping houses.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.420]   And that was credit-driven.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.060]   When you look at today, you have two problems.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.940]   One is after the financial crisis,
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.820]   builders just pivoted to apartments and multifamilies
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.620]   and underbuilt single-family homes for almost a decade.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.820]   Depending on who you listen to,
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.180]   either the real estate agents
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.620]   or the Builders Association or whatever,
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.020]   we're two, three, four million houses short
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.540]   relative to how many new households
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.460]   and new people we have in the country.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.980]   We're well over 330.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.220]   - The irony of the last bust
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.140]   is that it helped create this boom, essentially,
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:12.980]   'cause they didn't build enough
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.940]   'cause everyone was so scared.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.200]   - The fear of the last bust sent builders
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.700]   into apartment buildings and things like that,
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.600]   which by the way, arguably, we don't have enough of those,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.960]   but there's a giant shortfall.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.600]   The pandemic certainly helped create.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.880]   People were buying second and third homes
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.240]   out of their primary city.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.320]   Today, you have two problems.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.120]   So you have too little supply.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.440]   And then making that worse is when the Fed raised rates,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.640]   hey, if you have a 3.5% mortgage,
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.320]   you're talking to the earlier question, a 3% mortgage,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.160]   you're gonna be really reluctant to say,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.640]   I'm gonna sell this and buy another house
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.200]   where my mortgage might be 6.5%.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.920]   That's locking a lot of people in place.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.360]   Perversely, the higher rates are causing, to some degree,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.240]   higher home prices and higher rental prices.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.560]   It's really a challenge.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.120]   I think the Fed has kind of raised as far as they should.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.760]   Otherwise, they're making the housing situation worse.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.760]   So this is not so much a bubble problem
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.080]   or a demand-driven problem as it is a supply problem.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.540]   We just need a whole lot more housing.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.380]   - And the other part, John,
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.280]   throw up the mortgage origination chart here,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.320]   my credit score, do the next, there you go.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.880]   And so this shows people taking those mortgages
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.680]   in 2020 and 2021 had much higher credit scores.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.240]   So the people who are sitting in these houses,
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.280]   even if housing prices were to drop 10 or 20%,
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.200]   like some people want to see happen,
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.640]   those people are still gonna be able to make their payments
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.760]   unless they lose their job.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.600]   So that's the problem.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.760]   Last time around, we saw all these people
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.880]   who couldn't make their payments.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.520]   They're having these mortgages reset higher
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.200]   'cause they took on the adjustable-rate mortgages.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.360]   This time around, it was mostly fixed-rate mortgages.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.320]   And so the people who have been buying homes
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.160]   are also much higher-quality borrowers.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.400]   So it's not just the lending standards,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.600]   it's that the borrowers themselves
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.040]   are in a much better position.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   - Yeah, look at that light blue.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.360]   Those are all your best 760 and up.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.960]   When you go back to the period before the financial crisis,
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.800]   they're a fraction of the borrowers here.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.400]   They're the vast majority of the borrowers.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.200]   - Yeah, so, right.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.680]   It seems like if you just took prices alone
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.440]   and you mapped 'em onto what happened
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.240]   the last time around, you'd think this has to be worse
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   'cause prices are up more,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.280]   but it's a much different situation.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.680]   And it's probably more frustrating for people
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.040]   who want to see prices crash, like Duncan.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.320]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's unimaginable
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.240]   to buy a home right now for a lot of us.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.880]   - It's tough. - We can dream.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.400]   Not that we wanna GFC again, but prices to come down.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   - Right, okay.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.720]   This next question actually is someone
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.400]   who is thinking about buying a new house.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.640]   So let's see this one.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.400]   Okay, up next we have a question from Zach.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.000]   "My wife and I do fairly well,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.160]   "but I'm a classic conservative planner/spender
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.640]   "and struggle to upgrade our life
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.520]   "or know when it's prudent to do so.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.320]   "I would love to get a bigger home for our kids
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.360]   "as they grow, but also don't want to be irresponsible.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.920]   "I'm 36 and make $300,000 a year.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.600]   "My wife is 34 and makes $85,000.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.040]   "We have $125,000 in brokerage/savings
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.880]   "and $400,000 in retirement.

[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.320]   "three plus years, though it does pay

[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.800]   "We pay $15,000 a year for private school
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.680]   "and would like to not be house poor."
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.020]   Second page.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.200]   "The problem is that we live in Orange County, California
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.280]   "and upgrading to a 2,000-square-foot pool home
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.180]   "would be in the mid-$1 million range,
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.920]   "and today's rates don't help.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.660]   "I'd love to keep our home and rent it,
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.880]   "but we'd be really cash-strapped without a HELOC,
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.200]   "and I don't think we want the headache of being a landlord.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.800]   "I'm completely paralyzed to make a move.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.020]   "My kids are eight and five,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.460]   "and I would love to give them a fun house
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.120]   "to grow up in for the next 10 years,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.200]   "but I'm also trying to be responsible.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   "I'm well aware that I'm blessed to be in this position,
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.640]   "but it weighs on me nonetheless."
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.080]   - Okay, so as we mentioned in the last question,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.100]   this is probably the worst time ever to be a homebuyer,
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.540]   supply being low, mortgage rates being high.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.440]   The good news is this person has some home equity,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.680]   but as with most things, there's a trade-off,
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.840]   especially when you're living in California, right?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.240]   You could stay in your current house and sacrifice size,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.680]   or you could move to a more expensive house
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.340]   and probably sacrifice some savings,
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.380]   or maybe move somewhere else,
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.440]   but then you have to give up on living in Orange County.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.280]   So this is obviously more of a psychological question
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.160]   than it is a financial one.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.960]   This person seems to be doing very well financially
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.440]   for someone in their mid-30s,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.320]   so it's really like how do I get over
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.040]   that psychological hurdle of,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.100]   I know that there are going to be trade-offs,
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.520]   and I know that whatever move I make,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.360]   I'm gonna have to be giving up on something.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.820]   So what is that thing?
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.680]   So how do you think about making financial decisions
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   when you are kind of paralyzed and you know,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.200]   I have this thing tugging me this way,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.600]   but this one tugging me the other direction,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.840]   and I can't figure out which one is which?
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.720]   - You know, you hinted at it.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.920]   All these decisions involve just two simple aspects,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.400]   human psychology and math.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.040]   So if you're wrapped up in the psychology,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.840]   do the math first.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.240]   All right, they have four,
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.240]   first let's get being a landlord out of the question.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.000]   When my wife and I got married,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   she was living in a co-op,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.760]   she moved into my apartment in the city,
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.680]   we were a landlord for 12 years.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.000]   It's a big pain in the ass, it's a job.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.840]   - It doesn't sound fun to me.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.920]   - And you really, you know, if you're busy,
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.560]   if your career is throwing off that much money
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.640]   at a young age, focus on that,
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.160]   not a side hustle for this particular person
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.320]   of being a landlord.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.400]   It's really a job,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.640]   and you probably have other things you wanna do
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.960]   with your time, so that's number one.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   Number two, the math sounds like,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.400]   A, if they wanna renovate their house,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.920]   spend a couple hundred thousand dollars,
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.080]   a HELOC is a really easy way to go.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.800]   They have a ton of equity,
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.360]   they're not gonna cash-strap themselves,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.320]   so that should be a no-brainer decision.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.080]   The real question is,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.660]   hey, do we wanna move out of this house
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.960]   to something that's a million and a half, $2 million,
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.560]   and that really depends on laying out a budget,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.160]   looking at what you're spending,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.300]   and saying, do we wanna do this?
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.280]   It looks like they'll be able to roll
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.360]   a half a million dollars or so out of this house
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.400]   between their savings. - And there's a down payment
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.240]   right there.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.080]   - Right, so in other words,
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.160]   it's not like they're going out and dropping,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.220]   hey, I'm gonna take a 7%, $2 million mortgage.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.400]   If they move to a house that's a million and a half dollars
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.940]   and they're taking a million,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.900]   they're putting half a million dollars down,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.740]   well, even at 6%,
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.260]   it looks like 5,000 a month won't make them cash-poor,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.580]   but they have to get past the psychology.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.740]   If they feel like that's gonna be too much
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.980]   and that's gonna, then stay where you are, do a HELOC.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.700]   Listen, when we moved into the house we're in now,
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.540]   which was a debacle and needed everything,
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.120]   we knew that going in,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.060]   we just were, every year we took a HELOC,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.840]   we did a project, we'd pay it down as fast as we could
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.480]   as soon as the HELOC was down to around 10, 20 grand,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.880]   we'd do the next project,
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.640]   and every time you need a new roof, you need new windows,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   you have to replace all the flooring in the house,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.440]   you have to, I mean, this was a real project house,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.840]   the only way we could afford it
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.320]   was it probably would have been double what we paid for
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   if it was in nice shape,
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.860]   and we got to do it the way we wanted to over time.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.880]   So if they wanna stay where they are,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.360]   HELOC is really easy to do.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.500]   - Yeah, that's why-- - As long as you manage it
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.980]   and you pay it down quickly.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.700]   - If you're in a position of already owning a home
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.420]   and you have equity, you're in a way better position
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.900]   than a first-time home buyer, sorry, Duncan,
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.740]   but 'cause you have that equity to play with
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.140]   where you can use it as a down payment
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.780]   or for the current house to fix it up.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.700]   So I'd say, yeah, I would use that equity
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.860]   and then you can slowly pay it off,
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.060]   you don't have to pay it off right away,
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.020]   and then you're not having to touch
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.420]   these other forms of income,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.060]   and then if you have that equity come through from his job,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.860]   that sounds like it's a ton of money,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.540]   you can pay it off with that eventually.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.080]   - Just keep in mind, by the time they have
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.840]   a liquidity event for that job,
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.120]   typically the tide is raising all boats
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.520]   and that might be sending home prices up
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.280]   'cause he won't be the only person having that windfall.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.680]   So that's always the trade-off,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.200]   is you have to think a couple of steps ahead.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.520]   Hey, when my ship comes in,
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.920]   are lots of other ships coming in
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.440]   and the prices are gonna go up?
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.160]   So it seems crazy to think that at this hour,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   I'm gonna be able to lock in $2 million
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.460]   as a ridiculous home price.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.100]   Nobody knows what they're gonna look like
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.100]   10 years from now.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.300]   - I'm guessing California has the most challenging state
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.540]   of all in terms of making these housing decisions.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.300]   - Especially in areas like Silicon Valley
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.580]   and near LA and San Diego.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.820]   There's still pockets that are less expensive,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   but it's expensive for a reason,
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.620]   a lot of people wanna live there.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.200]   - Right, all right, we got one more, Duncan.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.880]   - Question about that real quick though,
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.200]   what's the size square footage-wise
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   that a family of four really needs, you think?
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.680]   It's very skewed for me in my mind
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.960]   because I lived in a 385 square foot place
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.000]   during the pandemic, so.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.920]   - I had a 400 square foot apartment
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.460]   that was essentially a fridge and a bed and a bathroom.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.300]   That was way back in the day.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.520]   - We had a pocket door, we had a pocket door.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.200]   - Depends if your kids are okay with,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.280]   give 'em the pool, they'll probably take less square footage
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.120]   because that counts as part of the house in California.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.760]   - And that's the nice thing about outdoor living
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.640]   is you don't need a giant house if,
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.240]   especially in places where the weather's so nice,
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.640]   you could be out all the time.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.320]   That said, 2,000 square feet gives you a guest bedroom
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.200]   or a home office or a little breathing space.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.960]   Sometimes if, especially these days
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.680]   where people are working remote,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.720]   kids underfoot, it's not easy.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.840]   So you could see why there's a desire
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.340]   for a little more elbow space.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.320]   - Our debate on Animal Spirits was
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.880]   what size house gives you a mansion?
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.760]   And we landed on 5,000, so I say cut that in half.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.520]   - That's my number, 5,000, right.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.640]   - 2,500, cut that in half.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.280]   2,500 is probably good for a family of four.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   - 5,000 is just giant.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   And by the way, if you wanna live in certain areas
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.040]   and you don't want a giant house,
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.560]   you want a small house on a lake,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.800]   on the water, in the mountains,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.320]   everybody is building these immense things.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.020]   There's no, you know, 2,500, 3,000 square feet
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.440]   for a couple that's downsizing.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.680]   The kids are out of the house.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.600]   Really hard to find things like that.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.440]   - Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.520]   - Also, personal finance tip.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.660]   Give the kids the choice.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.280]   Would they rather have a pool or go to private school?
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.700]   You know, let 'em pick.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.540]   (laughing)
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.400]   - There you go, got those lessons early.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.800]   - All right, up next we have a question from Cameron.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.440]   What are your thoughts on what will happen
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.240]   to the economy when $18 billion
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.800]   in monthly student loan payments are turned back on?
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.440]   It seems as though it will significantly
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.880]   affect consumer spending and savings.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.300]   - We've got a number of questions on this.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   So I think there's something like 27 million borrowers
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.160]   that were part of that moratorium,
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.000]   put their payments on hold.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.600]   The idea is those people have turned
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.920]   those savings into spending, right?
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.880]   That was a boost for a lot of people,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.720]   helping make it through.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.920]   Now it's been a couple years,
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.120]   and it's gonna be hard for those people
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.960]   to go back to making the payments again.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.680]   And friend of the show, Sam Rowe,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   put together a compilation of these estimates
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.760]   on his sub-stack.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.840]   JP Morgan said it's gonna be like 0.1% of GDP.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.980]   Goldman Sachs said like 0.2% of GDP.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.060]   I think a couple of them said, you know,
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.860]   handful, it's like a handful of basis points.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.260]   Sorry, not 0.2, but like 0.02.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.740]   So it's a handful of basis points.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.020]   And John, throw up the chart here of total household debt.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.300]   Total household debt's like $17 trillion.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.380]   Student loan is 1.6.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.180]   That's pretty close to auto loans too.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.060]   Mortgage debt is the big one at 12 trillion.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.080]   So student loan debt is like 9% of total debt.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.740]   But then you also have to take the percentage
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.240]   of those people in student loans
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.980]   who are going to have trouble making the payments.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.980]   And I think that's where the rub comes.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.500]   A lot of people think everyone's gonna have trouble
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.940]   making those payments, and I don't think
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.080]   that that's going to necessarily be the case.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.180]   So I think a lot of people would like to see this
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.300]   be like an end times thing, and I think it's gonna be
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.500]   a much smaller impact than most people assume.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.640]   - So let's put some meat on those bones.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.540]   The U.S. economy is about 23 and a half trillion dollars.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.020]   2/3 of that is consumer spending.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.940]   Let's call that 15 trillion dollars.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.580]   And the question was 18 billion with a B.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.100]   18 billion a month.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.860]   You're barely up to 216 billion dollars
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.760]   if everybody has problems.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.860]   And you know that the vast majority of these folks
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.700]   aren't gonna have problems.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.660]   So this is a rounding error.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.980]   And this is also one of my favorite pet peeves,
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.660]   which is people looking at the liability side
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.020]   of the equation, but not looking at the asset side.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.340]   What matters isn't total debt, because every year
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.260]   there's more people, there's more debt.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.540]   Debt is always at a record.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.500]   It's a scare chart.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.540]   What you really wanna look at is the ability
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.620]   for individuals to service that debt.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.340]   What's the ratio of total debt to discretionary income?
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.060]   And it plummeted following the financial crisis,
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.740]   and then went down even more after 2020
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.900]   when a lot of pandemic money flowed into people.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.780]   - So I'll share that chart with you guys.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.980]   It's really very, very manageable.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.680]   Now when it reverses, when the discretionary income
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.420]   to debt spikes, it's telling you people
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.380]   are having a harder time carrying their debt
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.360]   and managing it.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.240]   But all these issues, it's called double entry accounting
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.180]   for a reason.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.340]   Liabilities on this side, assets and income,
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.560]   the ability to pay.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.140]   On the other side, if you look at one without the other,
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.740]   you're only getting half the picture.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.420]   - I showed the total liabilities at 17 trillion.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.900]   The Fed publishes this once a quarter.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.460]   The last one they have is through March.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.280]   Total assets in this country is like 141 trillion.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.120]   - Crazy, right?
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.740]   Giant, absolutely, absolutely giant.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.900]   I'll find this.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.940]   Just look for it on Fred.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.900]   Discretionary income to debt, and it's just been falling.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.300]   It's ticked up a little bit since post-pandemic,
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.540]   but it's so far below where it was pre-2010.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.980]   It's a different world.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.220]   - And I don't mean to make judgments
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.220]   on a big group of people,
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.740]   but if you have a high student loan balance,
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.040]   you probably haven't been a huge part of the economy anyway
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.460]   in terms of spending, right?
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.880]   And most of the people who have student loan debt are young,
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.340]   so they probably aren't really steering the economy
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.500]   as it is in terms of spending.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.620]   So those people aren't going to have
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.140]   a really big impact either way.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.900]   - Except on, I'd say a lot of independent coffee shops
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.460]   around big cities are about to have a real tough time.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.220]   - They're just there for free Wi-Fi anyway.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.440]   Let's talk-- - Yeah, it's true.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.280]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.460]   Someone sits there for three hours,
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.900]   they bought a $5 coffee,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.500]   and now they're not going to be able to pay that.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.340]   - That's true.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.820]   - People will find a way to manage that.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.860]   I'm pretty confident of that.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.560]   - Okay, no show next week because of the holiday.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.400]   We're taking the week off.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.060]   I think we do have Animal Spirits next week.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.020]   Maybe, is that the only thing on the compound next week?
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:27:59.860]   - Oh, no, no, no.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.680]   We've got TCAF.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.580]   We've got a special release on Monday, actually,
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.420]   for July 4th. - Okay, so we got
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.820]   other stuff going on. - So yeah, we got a lot.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.760]   Yeah, that's why we're not doing this, though.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.240]   We're not doing this, the compound.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.580]   - Yeah, good thing.
