[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - On April 29th, NBA star Jason Collins
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.480]   announced that he is gay,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.640]   and in doing so, he became the first openly gay
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.520]   professional athlete in American team sports,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.400]   at least male team sports.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.160]   Collins also claims to be a Christian.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.520]   In response to the announcement,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.720]   ESPN analyst Chris Broussard responded by saying this.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.080]   - Personally, I don't believe that you can live
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.360]   an openly homosexual lifestyle or an openly,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.240]   like premarital sex between heterosexuals.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.440]   If you're openly living that type of lifestyle,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520]   then the Bible says you know them by their fruits.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.320]   It says that, you know, that's a sin.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.200]   And if you're openly living in unrepentant sin,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000]   whatever it may be, not just homosexuality,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   adultery, fornication,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.920]   premarital sex between heterosexuals,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.360]   whatever it may be,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.480]   I believe that's walking in open rebellion
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.280]   to God and to Jesus Christ.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.120]   So I would not characterize that person as a Christian
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.720]   'cause I don't think the Bible
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.680]   would characterize him as a Christian.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.120]   - ESPN, of course, backed away from Broussard's statement,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.520]   apologized and called it a distraction
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.960]   to Collins' announcement.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.520]   And soon thereafter, Broussard got called things like
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.340]   unkind, hateful, abusive, intolerant, and bigot
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.680]   for what he said on air.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.640]   But the foundational question to begin with,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.920]   Pastor John, is this one.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.480]   Is Broussard right in what he said?
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.000]   - I listened to the excerpt.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.480]   I didn't hear the whole program.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.800]   And my answer is yes, he's right.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   And I think he would agree with a few clarifying comments.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   So let me expand the simple yes answer
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.240]   just so that people can hear my heart
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.640]   and I think his heart behind that
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   and a richer, fuller biblical understanding.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.920]   All brokenness is owing to sin,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.040]   but it's not a sin to be broken.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.480]   When I say all brokenness is owing to sin,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   I mean all brokenness is owing to putting other treasures
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.000]   where God's supreme worth belongs.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.600]   And it doesn't mean that you did that.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.800]   Somebody else might have done it and then affected you.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.580]   So for example, it's not a sin to be an amputee,
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.320]   but you may have lost your leg
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.280]   because someone sinned against you.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.000]   Or it might have been your own sin.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.160]   You might have been planting a terrorist bomb
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.120]   and the thing went off early, blew your legs off.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.000]   It doesn't mean that the absence of your legs
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.400]   for the rest of your life is sinful,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.480]   that it's a sin to have no leg.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.920]   Even though sin may have been at the root
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.560]   of why the leg is gone.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.960]   And when sin came into the world through Adam and Eve,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.720]   everything broke, everything broke.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.200]   I'm broken and everybody else is broken
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   and our desires are all broken.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.960]   The sexual ones and the covetous ones
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   and the proud ones and the anger ones,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.800]   we're all a bunch of broken people,
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.080]   especially when it comes to our emotions.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   Now, that means that same sex desires
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.240]   are among those broken desires,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.140]   among those brokennesses.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.120]   They are disordered.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.920]   They are out of order from the way God designed us
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.400]   in the beginning for a man and a woman.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.920]   A parallel in me or most of us, Tony,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.380]   I think would be the desire for human praise.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.400]   I think virtually all humans,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.080]   as I read Jesus and his anger
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.460]   and his condemnation of hypocrisy of the Pharisees
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.440]   and how they love to stand on the street corner
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.080]   and get human praise,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.720]   I think all of us are disordered
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.340]   in the way we crave human approval
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.360]   over against God's approval.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.400]   So because of my sin,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   my desire for human praise is a disordered desire.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.100]   And if I give way to this desire,
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.220]   just like if the person with same sex desires
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.360]   gives way to his desires,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.200]   we both will be living in sin.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.840]   Now, that's what Chris Broussard
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   called living in open rebellion.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.960]   If you look at your disordered desire and say,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.880]   "I don't care.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.120]   "I'm going to embrace that and I'm gonna walk into it.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.240]   "I'm gonna make that my identity and my life.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.200]   "I'm gonna live it out."
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   If I did that with human praise,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.800]   I'd be living in idolatry and living in sin.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.720]   And if a person with same sex desires
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.240]   does that with his sexual desires,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.520]   he's living in idolatry, he's living in sin.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.640]   And both of us are told,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.720]   this is the key text in the New Testament
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.200]   or one of the key texts, 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   that idolaters and adulterers
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.880]   and men who practice homosexuality and thieves
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   And you can see the kind of lineup there.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.200]   Homosexuality as a practice
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.800]   is not in a class by itself in the New Testament.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.680]   It's lined up along with things like thievery
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.360]   and greed and idolatry,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.560]   which means more things can lead to destruction
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.880]   than just homosexual practice.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.080]   So what I think he was getting at
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.200]   and that he was right is that the Bible teaches
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.920]   that if we embrace our disordered desires,
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.120]   whether we're like kleptomaniacs or pyromaniacs
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.880]   and we just love to start fires or love to start,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.040]   anything that's broken in us,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.680]   if we embrace that and just set every house on fire
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   in the neighborhood, we're gonna be guilty.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.080]   And if we embrace our heterosexual cravings
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.840]   for a woman besides our wives,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.400]   we're gonna be living in sin.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.200]   And so it is, I think, with homosexual desires.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.640]   So yeah, I think he was right on.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.600]   If we're gonna be faithful to the Bible,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.360]   we're going to say that the embrace of our brokenness
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.840]   and the living out of a life of homosexual activity
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.680]   is going to be a living in rebellion against God.
