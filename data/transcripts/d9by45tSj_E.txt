[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   Hi, Cal. This is Sonali. I am a huge fan of your work and have listened to your podcasts
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.940]   and have all your books. My question today is about inertia. So I find that during the
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.340]   work week, I am busy and engaged with work and have a hard time, you know, sort of separating
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.840]   myself and getting into weekend mode. During the weekend, I run around doing fun stuff,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.320]   housework, recreational activities, and similarly have a really hard time getting myself back
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.040]   into work mode. What do you do about inertia and what is a good way to, you know, make
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.960]   that step change from work to leisure and leisure back to work? Thanks for all that
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.880]   you do, and I look forward to hearing your response.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.340]   Well, this is a good question. I've thought about this because I've had similar issues
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.720]   with it's hard to relax or it's hard to go back to work. I get this. I actually think
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.640]   there's a lot of useful wisdom to be extracted from the Jewish tradition. And I do feel bad
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.640]   that we're sort of bastardizing here something that has a rich theological history to apply
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.120]   to issues of productivity, but that caveat in place. If you look at the Shabbat Havdalah
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.520]   tradition in the Jewish tradition, what you have here is a ceremony that kicks off the
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.080]   beginning of the weekend, that kicks off the Jewish Shabbat, which is Saturday, but it
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.200]   is a rituals that begin in preparation for the sundown Friday. So sundown Friday, sundown
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.920]   Saturday, that's Shabbat, and during the period of Shabbat there's no work you're supposed
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.880]   to do, there's various restrictions that depend on exactly what type of Jewish tradition you
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.360]   follow, but it's different, it's a day of rest. But there's ritual that is done in the
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.520]   lead-up to Shabbat starting. You clean the house, there's candles that you light, there's
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   prayers that you say. There is wisdom in that wisdom tradition, right? This is a...we're
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.520]   going to go through certain motions to accomplish exactly this goal of changing our mindset
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.480]   away from the prosaic and towards the theological, away from the everyday and towards the heavens.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.760]   The same carefully designed rituals executed the same time each week go a long way towards
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.160]   shifting your mindset. So you can imagine having something similar. Friday night, we
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.120]   do this preparation for sundown, this is where I'm going to shift into weekend mode, something
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.000]   you do every Friday, whatever the equivalent is you want to create for lighting those candles
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.640]   and saying those prayers and cleaning the house, I think could be very effective. Jewish
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.840]   tradition then has the Havdalah ceremony after the sun goes down on Saturday for ending Shabbat,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980]   and it involves candles and other sorts of things. Well, from a productivity perspective,
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.900]   you should have a similar ritual for the ending of the weekend, and maybe this makes more
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.740]   sense on Sunday, right? But I'm going to go through some sort of ritual to say I'm leaving
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.040]   relaxation mode, and probably what could happen during this ritual is weekly planning. This
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.880]   seems like a natural way to end the weekend mode. You're saying I'm now going to not just
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.520]   jump into I'm on email and I'm trying to work, I'm going to jump into looking at my quarterly
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.840]   plan and looking at building my weekly plan off of that, trying to get a sense of what's
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.880]   coming on this week, what's going to happen, what's on my plate. It's actually like a fantastic
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.520]   transition back into the world of productive efforts. Now some people do this Sunday night,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.880]   some people do this Monday morning. I like to do it Monday morning so that I can leave
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.480]   my footprint of the weekend bigger, but it does eat up time on Monday morning, so however
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.840]   you want to do it. But you put those two ideas together, and I think we have a pretty nice
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.940]   ritual here for transitioning in and out of relaxation. So to summarize, have something
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.640]   you do on Friday at the end of the workday, something ceremonial, something physical,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.120]   we clean the house, we have a glass of wine, we go out and have dinner at the same restaurant,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.000]   I go to the same dive bar where the regulars are, whatever it is that you do to ritualistically
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.220]   switch into weekend mode. By the way, do a really clean shutdown before you start that.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.600]   Don't leave open loops. Make sure your mind is completely happy. There's not an email
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.440]   we missed. That's critical. There's not work that needs to be done this weekend that I
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.640]   forgot about that you can close those open loops, do the ritual. Then in that weekend,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.040]   using the weekly plan alternative, our sort of bastardized, secularized Havdalah, I'm
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.560]   going to sit down and build my weekly plan. It's going to take me about 30 minutes to
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.480]   an hour. And that's going to put me back into work mode. I'm not just jumping into it cold
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.960]   turkey. Alright, so that's my suggestion. We all should be a little bit more Jewish
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:03.720]   when it comes to how we manage our weekends.
