[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.260]  à®°×œ×¨×œØ±×œØ±, I want to say, is that you need to engage in conscious planning in order to protect your assets.
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:12.900]   Now, in the previous show, I expanded the concept of asset protection planning very, very broadly, much more broadly than is the customary use of that term.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:25.840]   In today's show, although I think that is a valid perspective for you to continue to think about, I want to restrict my use of this term asset protection planning to the more conventional meaning.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.060]   The field of asset protection planning is a field of asset protection planning.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.060]   The field of asset protection planning is a field of asset protection planning, especially as it's practiced in the legal profession, is newer than many other forms of legal practice. That's not to say it's entirely new, it's simply newer and it is developing. So let's start with the simpler questions.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:23.820]   Is it legal for you to engage in asset protection planning? In a word, yes, absolutely. It is legal for you to engage in asset protection planning. Now, there are some caveats that you should be aware of. But in short answer, asset protection planning is entirely legal. The field, the legal field of asset protection planning draws heavily on the field of estate planning.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.820]   So many of you may not know what the legal field is. The legal field of asset protection planning draws heavily on the field of estate planning. So many of you may not know what the legal field is. The legal field of asset protection planning is entirely legal. The legal field of asset protection draws heavily on the field of estate planning.

[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   You can generally give away money to other people as much as you like.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Now there are some tax implications if you give away
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   a lot of money but you can at any point in
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   time give money to other people
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   and you can do it completely tax free

[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:33.400]  , the legal process itself. Now let's talk for an additional minute about legality versus illegality. There are simple things you can do which may be entirely legal in some circumstances and may be good moves but at some point in time might cross over the legal line to become illegal, which is a very serious problem. Let me give you a very simple example. Let's assume for a moment that you take my advice seriously to make sure that you keep on hand cash.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   And I'm going to give you a very simple example. Let's assume for a moment that you take my advice seriously to make sure that you keep on hand cash.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:33.400]  , and I'm going to give you a very simple example. Now let's assume for a moment that you take my advice seriously to make sure that you keep on hand cash.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:12:03.200]   And I mean savings and physical cash, physical currency that's accessible to you. You look around and you recognize that there could be a hurricane that could come through town. You might need money to be able to pay somebody to cut the tree off your house and they're not going to take checks and credit cards. They're going to take cash. And so you recognize that I should have some cash or I might need to bail my kid out of jail and so I should have some cash. I should have access to some cash. And you decide, you know what, that's prudent financial planning.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:33.000]  , and I'm going to give you a very simple example. Let's assume for a moment that you take my advice seriously to make sure that you keep on hand cash.

[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.060]   create cash reserves.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:23.060]   Because when you take a distribution on your debit card as a cash advance, the only thing that gets registered in your bank in the ledger, the transaction ledger, for your checking account is the fact that you've spent $60 at Home Depot.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:31.060]   It doesn't say that $40 of that charge was for nails and screws for your construction project and $20 was cash.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.040]   It just says you spent $60 at Home Depot.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   .
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:14:03.060]   I'm go
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   It doesn't say that $40 was for nails and screws for your construction project and $20 was cash.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   It just says you spent $20 at Home Depot.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   And you stack them up and as the weeks and the months and even the years go by, eventually you arrive at the point where you have $10,000 in cash. Now of course this is divided out it's hidden carefully it's secured properly it's protected from somebody that's not aware of the money and it's not a little bit of money that's a little bit of money that's not worth it.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   So I think that's a little bit of money that's not worth it.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   But it's not a little bit of money that's not worth it.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   You've never told anybody about that $10,000 that you have in cash.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   There's no evidence or recording of your taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   There's no evidence of the cash.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   There's no evidence of the cash.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   There's no evidence of the cash.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   There's no evidence of the cash.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   There's no evidence of the cash.

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   If you're taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:15:03.100]  , if you're taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:03.100]   If you're taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:03.100]   If you're taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:03.100]   If you're taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   If you're taking it out if you've shredded your receipts and if you haven't made notations of that in your own personal accounting software there's no evidence of the cash.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   You now have $10,000 of private money in your possession.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   Now, does that help you in terms of asset protection planning?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   The answer is absolutely yes, it helps you because you have now taken some of your assets and made them more private.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   So now if you're involved in a car accident and somebody decides the hurt that
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   and somebody decides the hurt that they're going to get from you,

[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   You stole two million dollars. You need to pay it back. So you need to take the million dollars that you have, even though they can't legally touch it and give it to the person that you wronged.

[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.560]   allow one dime

[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   One of the things that most concerns me
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.520]   in 2018
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.220]   is the increasing collectivization

[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.720]   The idea that

[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.420]   Well, it doesn't work.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:47.020]   Just like it's entirely wrong, morally wrong, for me to get together with a band of my friends and then to come and say,

I want to close just with what I've always considered to be one of the most inspiring scenes in how to handle money. And it touches on these questions, that interplay between morality and justice and doing good.
