[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.900]   All right.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.800]   So let's do another question here.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.320]   We got one from Jeffrey.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.960]   Jeffrey says, should I stay at a job
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.440]   where the management actively tries to stifle productivity?
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.040]   Context is important here.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.160]   Looking at the elaboration, Jeffrey has been at this job
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.320]   for eight years.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.600]   I'm just thinking about that.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.000]   That would be funny if this was a question from Jesse.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.520]   And it was Jesse being like, how do I
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.760]   get out of a position where my manager is so unproductive
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.080]   and makes me unproductive?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.600]   And it was just a passive aggressive way
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.640]   of getting back at me.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.560]   And it turns out I'm a terrible boss that's
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.720]   really chaotic and disorganized.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.480]   All right.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.560]   All right, Jeffrey.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.600]   You've worked there for eight years.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   They manipulate-- your managers manipulate your workloads
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.440]   by assigning them at random times that
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.480]   are very disadvantageous, like Friday afternoons or afternoons
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.200]   before I leave to take the day off.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.280]   It's good paying benefits.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   But he's getting frustrated because it's our fault.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   I mean, we have been infecting poor Jeffrey here
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.560]   with visions of how knowledge work can actually unfold,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.160]   ways that's not overloaded, ways that's not stressful,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.480]   ways in which you are in control of your time.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.000]   And you're moving the needle and getting things done,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.880]   but on your own terms.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.680]   You're not overworked.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.560]   You're not overstressed.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.320]   And he's learned that that's all possible.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.680]   And he turns around, and his boss is like,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.880]   I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   We're in Lumberg territory.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800]   It's an office space reference.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.080]   All right, what do we do about this?
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.760]   Jeffrey, here's what I'm going to suggest.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.120]   Don't leave your job right away, but I'm
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.520]   going to make you more rigid.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   I'll explain how in a second.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.720]   If that blows up, if the Lumberg in your life says, no way,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.360]   I said I need this tomorrow, get it done,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.600]   then you start looking somewhere else.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.960]   And you can be confident that it was a good thing to do.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.000]   So here's what I mean by getting more rigid.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.960]   Get your systems in place and enforce them.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.520]   So in this case, you need a system--
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.720]   and this is something I've been working on recently
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.960]   and some of my thinking that I haven't published a lot yet.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.560]   So I'm giving you some ideas that are hot off the presses.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.760]   I'm a big believer in this external work system approach,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   where instead of just in knowledge work,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.080]   thinking about all things that need to be done
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.040]   as existing on individual people's plates.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.200]   We just throw these around on the people's plates.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.880]   Jeffrey, do this.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.240]   Now it's on your plate, and I don't have to worry about it.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.680]   Hey, Jesse, you do this.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.000]   Now it's on your plate, I don't have to worry about it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.600]   I'm a big believer in having an external system into which work
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.040]   that needs to get done goes, and that people then
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   pull work out of that external system
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.440]   as they have the appropriate time to do it.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.640]   I think this is actually probably the right structure
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.400]   for work assignment in most knowledge work scenarios.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.200]   A good external system has a few things to it.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.560]   One, a good filter.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.000]   So it's really clear, like here's
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.860]   a different type of work that could come into the system,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.480]   and it has to go through these properly shaped portals.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.840]   And if your work doesn't fit, then it doesn't go in.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.960]   So you're making the person assigning the work do more work.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.880]   Two, there's a real organizational ethic
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   inside of the system, how the work gets organized
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.520]   and prioritized.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.920]   That's thoughtful.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   And three, status is really clear to anyone who cares.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.160]   All right, this thing I put into the external system,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   it's been organized.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.760]   No one's working on it yet, but it's relatively high
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.880]   on the priority list.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.640]   Probably someone will get to it in the next two weeks.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.840]   I think in the end, that's what most knowledge work
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.760]   organizations need.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.840]   Now, Jeffrey, they're not going to do this.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.040]   So I want you to simulate this with yourself.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.200]   I want you to basically imagine that you
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.660]   have an external system you can control where work comes
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.720]   in through these holes, it gets organized.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.480]   If it doesn't fit, then it can't come in.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.840]   And clear status is given to the people who care about it.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.440]   And then there's what you're actually working on this week
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.400]   and this day.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.320]   And you work on a reasonable amount of stuff
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.600]   until it's done, and then you pull more stuff out
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.120]   of this system.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.600]   And how do you simulate something like this?
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.360]   I mean, I'm still working out the details,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.000]   but a few different things.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.720]   So how do you simulate that clear filter on what comes in?
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.600]   Well, someone put something on your plate that is half-baked,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.920]   and they don't give you all the information,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.680]   and they're just playing obligation hot potato
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.000]   and just trying to get it off their plate
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.240]   because it's on their head and they don't
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.600]   want it to be on their head.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.680]   You say something like, all right,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.600]   I'm happy to take this on board.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.240]   This is the information I'll need.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.440]   That's back to them.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.120]   So they'll have to give you and get you that information.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.520]   If you really want to push it here,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.880]   you can involve processes here.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.680]   You can say, I'm happy to take this on board.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.320]   There's a bunch of questions that
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.480]   would need to be resolved for me to really understand
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.400]   what you need here.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.280]   Please, I have these clear office hours.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.520]   So whenever is convenient for you,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.240]   you just jump on one of these.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.200]   Here they are.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.160]   And I'll get from you all the information I need.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.560]   Or here's my Calendly.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.280]   Take a 30-minute slot, and that's
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.120]   where I'll get all the information I need.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.000]   So now you are having these carefully shaped portholes
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.120]   in which information can come in that if it doesn't have
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.240]   everything you need, it's not coming in the system.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.080]   None of this like, hey, Jeffrey, can you
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.440]   see what we need to get this client's reimbursement
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.720]   up to date or something?
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.840]   Like, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.320]   Let's figure out exactly what that means.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.360]   And you can use processes and systems there.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.760]   Two, OK, once they're in the system,
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.960]   make its status really clear to people.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.680]   All right, I've taken this into my queue.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.760]   I'm looking at my queue now.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.320]   And there's like three or four things ahead of this.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.480]   So my best guess is probably it'll
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.760]   be a week from now before I can get to it
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.720]   without changing priorities on the queue.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.680]   Now, this means you've got to have this information really
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.440]   well put together.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.200]   You've got to have a keeping track of everything, what
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.840]   I'm working on.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.720]   You've got to have your act together, Jeffrey,
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.000]   if you're going to pull this off.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.920]   But you're giving them that good status update.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.440]   And then from an organizational perspective,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.760]   you're keeping it really clear.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   All the things, all the information, their status.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.920]   Use a Trello board for this.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.720]   Like, here's the stuff that I have all the information.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.400]   Here's the stuff I'm waiting to hear back on.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.560]   Here's the relative priority.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.920]   And you've got to be very careful in your weekly
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.360]   and daily planning to be pulling things from this list
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.600]   and actually getting the things done and being reliable.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.760]   And they can depend on you.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.000]   You can get idiosyncratic credits, idiosyncrasy credits.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.960]   That's the term.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.640]   It's an Adam Grant term.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.280]   You can get those credits, the ability
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.760]   to do things weird if you actually deliver.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   If you don't deliver, then you get no leeway.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.040]   And then actually, there it is.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   The stuff's in my system.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.320]   I pull out what's reasonable for the week.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.000]   They don't have the option anymore of saying,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.160]   it's Friday afternoon, get this done by Saturday morning.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.200]   And if they want to push back, they can push back.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.920]   But they have to push back on your system.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.880]   And they have to say, I don't want
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.640]   to have to give you that information.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.920]   If they say, no, I want this, whatever, you're like, OK,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.000]   but let me just tell you, these are the things that
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.800]   have to get moved to lower priority.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   They have to confront how much time you actually
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.280]   have available.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.120]   One of two things will happen.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.680]   One, they will say, Jeffrey's great.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.800]   He's been here eight years.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.440]   He delivers.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.200]   He's awesome.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.480]   We don't want to lose him.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.600]   I really just wanted clarity anyways.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.400]   I mean, I-- and here I'm simulating the boss.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.480]   I'm really disorganized.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.920]   I hate having things in my head.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.380]   I throw things on your plate as soon as I think about them,
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.520]   because I don't want to have to worry about them.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.480]   So long as I know I can trust you, oh, it's in your system,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.600]   you have the information, it's going to happen in two weeks,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.800]   and fine.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.100]   I don't have to think about it.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.800]   You do you.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.080]   Or they say, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.720]   Like, forget that.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.040]   You need to just respond to me and do everything
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.880]   right when I say it.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.320]   And then, Jeffrey, you have the information
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.360]   you need that it's time to find a different position.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   It might be quitting that job.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.660]   It might be changing your position within that company
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.560]   so that you're much more independent,
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.760]   where you're trading performance for freedom.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.800]   All right, I'm going to be more like a consultant.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.920]   Pay me by my performance, but you can't bother me.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.120]   Whatever you need to do, but give that a try.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.600]   Give the external system a try.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.800]   You might be surprised how much they'll put up with.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.100]   (upbeat music)
