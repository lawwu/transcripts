[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   I looked at seven different offers from banks like Capital One City,
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   Wells Fargo, discover citizens, and the bonuses ranged from $150 to $750 for
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.600]   depositing somewhere between 10 and $50,000.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.680]   Now, if you want to look at the annualized benefit, the deposit
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.480]   requirements were anywhere from about a month and a half to five months.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.160]   And so the annualized yield was about six to 12% on these bonuses.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.000]   So what you'll see is that the lower dollar amounts you deposit, the
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800]   higher kind of annualized yield you get.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.320]   And so the outlier there was citizens, which would give you $500 for
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920]   depositing $10,000 for five months.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.960]   And so if you annualize that, that's a 12% return, but it's only on $10,000.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.580]   So if you have $10,000 and that's it, this is great.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.280]   If you have a hundred thousand dollars, you'd need to find 10 offers like this,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.040]   and that would probably be exhausting.
