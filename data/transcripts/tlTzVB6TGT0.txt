[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   What we'll do first is do the hypnotic induction profile, a formal test of how hypnotizable
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.720]   you are, and we'll take it from there, okay?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   Any questions before we go on?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.720]   Okay.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.120]   So get as comfortable as you can.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.400]   Look straight ahead.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.280]   Now look up to the top of your head, all the way up high as you can.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280]   Keep your chin down.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280]   That's it.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.360]   Look up past your eyebrows, all the way up.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.040]   And as you keep looking up, slowly close your eyes.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   Good.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   Take a deep breath.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   Hold.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.040]   Ready.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.040]   Exhale.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.040]   Let the breath out.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.080]   Let your eyes relax, but keep them closed and let your body float.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.560]   Imagine you're floating somewhere safe and comfortable, like a bath, a lake, a hot tub,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.840]   or just floating in space.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800]   And while you concentrate on your body floating into the chair, I'm going to concentrate on
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.640]   your left hand and arm.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   In a moment, I'm going to stroke the middle finger of your left hand.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.560]   When I do, you'll develop a sense of tingling and numbness and lightness, and you'll let
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.200]   it float upwards.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.920]   Ready.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920]   That's good.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.600]   First, you may notice some restless movement sensations in your fingers, which will spread
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.640]   to your hand and arm.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.480]   You may get the sense of a magnetic pull as your elbow bends and your forearm floats into
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.040]   an upright position, all the way up higher and higher, as the rest of your body feels
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.720]   heavy and relaxed.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.480]   Each breath deeper and easier.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.280]   Breath in, and then slowly exhale.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.080]   Higher and higher.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.440]   Already exhale.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.600]   That's good.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:54.120]   The higher it goes, the lighter it'll feel.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.000]   Each breath deeper and easier.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.680]   Now I'm going to position your arm like so, and give you this instruction.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.280]   Your hand will remain light and in this upright position, even after I give you the signal
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.080]   for your eyes to open.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.320]   If I pull your hand back down to the table, it will float right back up to the upright
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   position.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.840]   You'll find something pleasant and amusing about this sensation.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.320]   Later, when I touch your left elbow, your usual sensation and control will return.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.680]   Each time you go into this state of concentration, you'll find it easier and easier to use,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.320]   and you can use it to help you concentrate on what's important to you.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.000]   Right now, we'll come out of this state of concentration together by counting backwards
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   from three to one.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.840]   On three, you'll get ready.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.360]   On two, with your eyelids closed, roll up your eyes, and on one, let your eyes open.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Ready?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   Three, two, one.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   Good.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.640]   Now, stay in this position, please, and describe what physical sensations you're aware of now
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.680]   in your left hand and arm.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.800]   I'm feeling some tingling in my left hand.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Tingling?
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200]   Just gentle tingling.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Is it comfortable?
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yes, very.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.680]   My body feels very, very relaxed, and I feel like my shoulders are straight across for
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440]   the first time.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   Great.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.400]   Does your left hand feel as if it's not as much a part of your body as your right hand?
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   Yes.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.480]   I only remembered I had my left hand when you asked that question.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   Okay.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   Good.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   Now, please note this.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:51.200]   Yeah, I don't know how to describe what just happened.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.180]   I feel like I've got a hinge in my elbow.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.180]   A hinge.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.180]   All right.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.680]   Well, look at your left hand and watch what's going to happen.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:12.160]   My left hand doesn't really look like it belongs to me.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   Really?
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:25.120]   I mean, it does, but I don't know why I can do this.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.720]   Can you describe what it feels like as it's going up?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.360]   Yeah, it feels very relaxed.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.240]   I think it would be hard to hold it like this, but it feels easy to hold it like this.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   Good.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:59.680]   I feel the middle finger more than the others.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680]   I don't know why.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   Interesting.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   Wow.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   Is that surprising at all?
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.680]   Yeah, it's very unusual.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.440]   Yes, I know it's wild, but I'm surprised by my own hand, which has not happened before.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.440]   All right.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   Good.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.880]   Now, by way of comparison, please raise your right hand.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.560]   Put your right arm down.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   Are you aware of a relative difference in sensation in your left hand going up compared
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   to your right?
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.680]   Yeah, the right hand feels more apart.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.200]   This one's more part of this part of me.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.560]   It's like I feel like at my left elbow, everything changes.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.360]   Is one arm lighter or heavier than the other?
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.480]   This, my right, is definitely heavier.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.820]   Are you aware of a relative difference in your sense of control over one hand going
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.820]   up compared to the other?
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.960]   Yeah, the left hand is, yeah, that's going to take some work to work with the left hand.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   All right.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   So, more control on the right?
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   Yes.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   All right.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   Now, make a fist with this hand.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   Tight fist.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   Okay.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   Ready?
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   Open.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960]   Open it?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   Yeah, open it.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   Okay.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.480]   Are you aware of a sense of sensation and control now in your left hand and arm compared
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   to a moment before?
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.360]   Yeah, but it still feels kind of not of me.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   Not of you?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   A little bit.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   It's coming back.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   Okay.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:28.680]   Well, I don't think I've ever paid that much attention in my left hand before.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.840]   Is the control equal now in the two hands, or do you still feel?
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.760]   Yeah, it's about, you know, maybe 10% less over here.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.840]   Okay.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.160]   So before you had less control in the left, now it's getting to the same again.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.340]   Did I do or say anything that would indicate there'd be a change in sensation of control
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.000]   in your left hand and arm?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Only the fist?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   No, I don't.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Backing your fist.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.120]   Did I say anything to you about your elbow or touching your elbow?
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.080]   Oh yeah, that when you touch my elbow that it would return control, but I don't remember.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.320]   I remember what I don't remember, but only now that you've told me, but clearly something
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   about my perception of time is off because I feel like this is, that was a long time
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   ago.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   A long time ago.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   How long?
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   Oh goodness.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   I don't know, but it feels really good to squeeze my fist.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   It does.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   It feels amazing.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.000]   Did you have any sense of floating lightness or buoyancy in your left hand and arm during
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   the test?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Yes.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Almost like there was a, um, like a tether.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Tether pulling up.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Did you have that sense in any other part of your body, head, neck, thighs, abdomen,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.320]   chest, all over or just your left hand and arm?
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.360]   Just my left, um, hand and arm, but the rest of my body is really relaxed.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   Relaxed.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.400]   I always have a little bit of right side pain, lower back pain always, and it's, um, that
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   feels good now.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   It does?
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   It does.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   It does.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   And I can feel my feet too.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   Okay.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   So are you feeling any pain in your back?
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   No.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   No.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   No pain.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Good.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   Okay.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   So the hand is okay now?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   It's about 98%.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   Okay.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   It's kind of like that.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   All right.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Well, that's the end of the test and your score is nine and a half out of 10.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   So you are very hypnotizable.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   Okay.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.520]   Um, as gauged by, am I out of hypnosis yet?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.880]   Uh, I hope so.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   Yes.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   Okay.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.880]   You are.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   I don't know.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:33.000]   The eye roll that we did initially, you, you had the up gaze as you kept your eye up was
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.640]   two out of four, but you were converging your eyes and you can't keep looking up and squint
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.880]   at the same time.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.280]   So your eye roll score was a four.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   Which is the maximum.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   That's the maximum.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   Which is consistent with the last time we, we did hypnosis.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   I think it was about three years ago.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   Was it that long ago?
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   I guess so.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   Wow.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   But then I hear your voice in the Reverie app.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.320]   So when we, when we interviewed today, there was, um, when you start talking and even in
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.960]   our lab meetings, occasionally I have to remember that I'm not going to go under.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.160]   And our, our colleague, Dr. Malice Yilmaz says the same thing.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.500]   She's done a lot of hypnosis.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   Oh really?
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   I don't think she'd mind me saying that.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.760]   That, um, and that, yeah, that the voice is a strong trigger.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   So interesting.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760]   I didn't, I didn't know that.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   I think my hands back.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   You think it's back now?
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   Good.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   Well, we want you to leave the room with it.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.500]   So that's, that's good.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   What happened there?
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.460]   Um, I mean, at, at, uh, what was that about?
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.880]   Well, it's, you're affiliating with a metaphor, with an image that it will feel light and
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.660]   buoyant and, uh, you're dissociating it.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:43.820]   So I think it's in part that DLPFC inverse, um, connectivity with the PCC that you're,
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.360]   you're sort of inner, your interoception of your arm is sort of separated from the task,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.200]   the hypnotic task of making this feel different.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.460]   And so the implication is sort of that it's not you in a sense that the hand is sort of
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.460]   doing what it wants to do is kind of what it feels like.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.420]   And so you're complying with the instruction, but also showing that you can really reorganize
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.860]   your interoception of your left hand and arm and also what it does physically.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.900]   So I felt like from here forward was a completely different experience.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.900]   Interesting.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.060]   I think it is that sort of, it's the connection to the insula and the disconnection from the
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.860]   PCC that I think is, is doing it.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.540]   Is there anything that I should pay attention for today?
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.540]   No.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.060]   No, I, I don't think so unless you stay, does it still feel strange or is it?
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.060]   I feel cohesive.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.060]   Oh, good.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.060]   Okay.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.660]   So you can turn it on, you can turn it off and that's the messages you get.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.660]   That's internal, right?
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.660]   That's internal.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.660]   You can do it.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.660]   And the fact that your back feels better now is a side effect.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.660]   That's good.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.660]   There's something I can't, yeah.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   I remember saying something about my shoulders, but the.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.340]   You said your shoulders for the first time felt level.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.740]   I've always got a little bit of a tilt this way and yeah, it felt like it felt level.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740]   Good.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.740]   Good.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.740]   Thank you.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:03.740]   You're welcome.
